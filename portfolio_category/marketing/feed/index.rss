										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fika Bar &amp; Kitchen, based in Brick Lane, East London, has built up a loyal following since its 2008 launch. In recent years, however, the venue’s weekday trade has suffered from an influx of new bars, restaurants and cafes into the increasingly trendy Brick Lane area. To combat this threat, Fika needed to freshen-up its brand image to re-engage with its audience, encourage customer loyalty and re-establish its credentials as a fun, quirky place to visit. Designers Anonymous were asked to devise a flexible, easy-to-implement, multi-faceted identity that would be effective across multiple touch-points.</p>
<p>Fika’s weekday trade has approximately tripled in volume since the new exterior signage and window displays have appeared and the recently launched ‘Fika Klubb’ has gained a steady growth in numbers. The brand refresh has been implemented in stages and further positive results are expected.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All hands and brains on deck for Art Stage 2012, which made its debut earlier this year as the art world’s new global destination. Our design practice introduced the iconic equator as a two-fold anchor for all graphic material to relay the social, economical and geographical highlights of Singapore (which is on the equator!) as a venue for Art Stage. It also drew attention as the focal point for the artistic community and gathering place of over 45,000 artists, galleries and collectors over 3 days in January. Designed by The Secret Little Agency.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everyone says they are ‘green’ — so Clear’s challenge was to prove Nishi’s credentials. With out being preachy Clear set out to create a brand language that was approachable, friendly, humourous and direct. From the use of the colour yellow taken from the colour of recycling bins (beyond green it is yellow), to the immediatacy of the use of ‘Le Corbusier’ a stencil based font, Nishi has an immediate and directly applied feel. The visual language is bold and purposeful. The design intent was informed by our brand strategy process — and was developed to reflect the central brand thought of ‘living in a way that matters’. The applications include the brand mark, ‘Dereks Little Helper’ the sales brochure, the sales tool, art direction of the renders and most recent ad campaign. Other applications included eDMs, tender documents, hoarding, banner ads — oh yes the sales suite.</p>
