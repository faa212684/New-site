Meet <a href=\"https:\/\/www.palm.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Palm<\/a>, a connected device that celebrates the choice to be both connected and present. Palm is designed for life on the go. Put it into your smallest pocket, wear it on your neck or slip it into your yoga pants. About the size of a credit card and light enough to forget about, you can take your connectivity with you everywhere &#8211; from the treadmill, to the beach, to your little black dress. Palm isn&#8217;t a replacement for your smartphone &#8211; it&#8217;s a fully connected product that is in sync with your existing smartphone, so all of your connectivity can go where your smartphone can&#8217;t. Palm runs Android OS, works with Verizon NumberShare, is voice-activated with Google Assistant, and has a 12MP rear and 8MP front-facing camera to capture every moment with stunning quality.&#8221;<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/palm_2018_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo for Palm\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/palm_2018_product_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Palm\" \/>\n<figcaption>The product in &#8220;titanium&#8221;.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/palm_2018_product_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Palm\" \/>\n<figcaption>The product in gold.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/palm_2018_product_02a_size.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Palm\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/palm_2018_product_02b_size.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Palm\" \/>\n<figcaption>Size relationship.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/palm_2018_product_03_steph_curry.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Palm\" \/>\n<figcaption>Investor Steph Curry (of the NBA&#8217;s Golden State Warriors) with the Palm.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Fycs1-ElYGs\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Product introduction video.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"(Re-launched 2018) &quot;Palm was one of the first companies to bring your digital life from your desktop to your palm back in 1996.
