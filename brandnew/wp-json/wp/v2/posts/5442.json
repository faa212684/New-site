This is not the typical Friday Likes&#8230; it&#8217;s not the typical gold foil restaurant thing but a freight company. Freight companies are not meant to look this good. They are not meant to look good, period. Designed by Athens, Greece-based <a href=\"http:\/\/luminous.gr\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Luminous Design Group<\/a>, the logo is a swarm of dots forming the initials of the company that convey the idea of gathering a bunch of things into a bigger thing (cargo in ship) but what makes it stand out is that the &#8220;CO&#8221; letters are never fully formed giving the logo a nice sense of dynamism. The identity is okay; the blue on blue tones work perfectly but the Art Deco sans serif for the wordmark and applications is pretty awful, I&#8217;ll admit. Still, I could look at that swarming GIF for most of the day. (Also, apologies for the dithery image but I really wanted to include the animated GIF). <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/luminous.gr\/projects\/cosmos-ocean-branding\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Treuleben by Paperlux<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_treuleben.jpg\" alt=\"Treuleben by Paperlux\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.treuleben.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Treuleben<\/a> is a line of luxury calendars and stationery that have been perfect for 100 years in Geesthacht, Germany. Previously known as Treuleben &amp; Bischof the new identity reflects the shortened name and has a handsome new wordmark and monogram designed by Hamburg, Germany-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.paperlux.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Paperlux<\/a>. Much of the visual success of this identity relies on the beautiful products but a bad logo or set of logos or even over-designing could ruin even the finest leather. The monogram is delightful and all the typography and white space is perfectly executed. A far cry from iCal, for sure. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/51705143\/Treuleben\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Bodega Los Cedros by Anagrama<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_loscedros.jpg\" alt=\"Bodega Los Cedros by Anagrama\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/bodegaloscedros.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bodega Los Cedros<\/a> is a vineyard in the state of Coahuila, Mexico, in the mountainous, forest-y region of Arteaga. (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=Arteaga&#038;lr=lang_en&#038;tbs=lr:lang_1en&#038;source=lnms&#038;tbm=isch&#038;sa=X&#038;ved=0ahUKEwj2p5y8gMfTAhWk7oMKHRNlA9IQ_AUIDCgD&#038;biw=1381&#038;bih=863\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Check it out<\/a>; road trip!) The vineyard and winery is named after the cedar tree and the logo features, yup, cedar trees. While that is a simplistic premise, the execution by Anagrama is killer, representing the trees in three attractive, hand-drawn scribbles. Rendered in black on white and with plenty of white space, the trees look elegant but also earthy and the handwriting makes a great companion. The wrapping tissue paper for the bottles is extra nice. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/anagrama.com\/portafolio\/251-bodega-los-cedros\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Another round of minimal design with work from Athens, Hamburg, and Monterrey&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[51,36,69,11,26],"tags":[1121,579,1005,691,1133],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5442"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=5442"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5442\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=5442"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=5442"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=5442"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
