As 37signals, we launched several successful products, created and open-sourced Ruby on Rails, wrote a few best-sellers, and published thousands of posts on the Signal v. Noise blog. In 2004, we created and launched a little project management tool named <a href=\"https:\/\/basecamp.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Basecamp<\/a>. We built Basecamp to scratch our own itch: We needed a simple, usable program to help us stay organized, communicate with our clients and each other, and make it easier to finish projects together. Over time, Basecamp grew into something much bigger. In 2014, ten years to the day that Basecamp launched, 37signals became Basecamp, a one-product company (read more on that here). Today, people all over the word manage millions of Basecamp projects and create thousands of new accounts every week. With customers in nearly every industry and every country on Earth, we&#8217;re helping a whole lot of creative teams do their best work.&#8221;<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/basecamp_2019_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo for Basecamp done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/basecamp_2019_icon.png\" alt=\"New Logo for Basecamp done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icon.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"(Est. 2004) &quot;Back in 1999 (pretty much forever ago, in Internet Years), we opened a web design company called 37signals.
