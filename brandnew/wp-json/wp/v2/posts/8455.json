(I couldn&#8217;t figure out what the name stands for.) The identity, designed by Lisbon, Portugal-based <a href=\"https:\/\/joanaareal.pt\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Joana Areal<\/a>, is \u00fcber minimalist, with the name typeset in a simple sans serif and each number underscored&#8230; what elevates this beyond another ho-hum simple design is how stunning it looks embossed in the ceramic bottles and the classy color palette for the boxes and labels. I&#8217;ll admit that I was also swayed by the rocky presentation. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/joanaareal.pt\/8950.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Casa Cardona Wines by Mar\u00e7al Prats<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_casacardona.jpg\" alt=\"Casa Cardona Wines by Mar\u00e7al Prats\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.casacardona.cat\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Casa Cardona<\/a> is a very limited edition of wines that were purchased by a group of friends in Barcelona and intended for personal (re)distribution only, under the new moniker, taken from Cardona Square, Barcelona. The packaging, by London, UK-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.marcal.net\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mar\u00e7al Prats<\/a>, takes inspiration from 1960s Op-art and renders portraits of the friends in a cool, trippy style that would probably be fairly un-marketable if this were a widely distributed commercial product but as a kind of artistic expression on a bottle, it&#8217;s quite fun. Like 8950 above, I&#8217;m also swayed by the extra trippy presentation of the bottles with additional color stripes illuminated unto the bottles for an additional hit of Op-art. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/91492119\/Casa-Cardona-Wines\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Foreword by Ghost<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_foreword.jpg\" alt=\"Foreword by Ghost\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.foreword.consulting\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Foreword<\/a> provides leadership consulting for executives to help them become better leaders or help them establish strong cultures in their workplace. Designed by Oklahoma City, OK-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ghost.agency\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ghost<\/a>, the identity is quite straight<em>forward<\/em> with a nice sans serif wrapped inside a bookmark holding shape that, as a bonus, has a neat arrow in the negative space at the beginning. It&#8217;s nothing groundbreaking but it&#8217;s very nicely deployed in print applications on a lovely range of colored stock and a slick use of clear foil stamping. Also, I would wear those pins for no reason whatsoever other than they are nice as F. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ghost.agency\/project\/foreword\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"A range of soft-colored projects from very different industries this week, with work from Lisbon, London, and Oklahoma City.
