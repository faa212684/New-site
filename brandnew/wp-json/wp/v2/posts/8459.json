Guta has grown quickly and efficiently in the last year, now counting with almost 60 stores that range from roaming carts, to small booths, to full-blown stores, most of them providing a Vietnam staple: a tiny plastic chair to place on the street and sit on. The new identity for Guta has been designed by local firm <a href=\"https:\/\/m-n.associates\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">M &#8212; N Associates<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/guta_old.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Guta by M &#8212; N Associates\" \/>\n<figcaption>Samples of OLD menu items and presentation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>Guta is from a Vietnamese verbal slang, from &#8220;gout \/gu\/&#8221; in French and &#8220;ta&#8221; in Vietnamese, together stands for the term &#8220;our style&#8221;. Representing for Guta&#8217;s brand spirit, they proud to serve a decently good strong Vietnamese coffee. From the most common culture of Saigon, street-coffee has become a fundamental habit of not just Saigonese but also Vietnamese. Beneath the habitual culture, there&#8217;s always a &#8220;plastic chair&#8221;, small and convenient to setup anywhere to become a small coffee shop.<br \/><br \/>The graphic system was taken over by the iconic chair as center combined with all surrounding environmental elements and people behaviors. All together, creating a complete unique &#8220;style&#8221; for Guta and echos what the brand comes from.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/m-n.associates\/work\/guta\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">M &#8212; N Associates project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/guta_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Guta by M &#8212; N Associates\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo was bad with its overly playful font choice, super tight kerning, and oddly tall &#8220;E&#8221;, but not entirely terrible as it was welcoming and friendly. The new logo drops the &#8220;cafe&#8221; part, allowing &#8220;GUTA&#8221; to be more prominent and introduces a custom wordmark that at first feels kind of clunky with its bottom-heavy &#8220;U&#8221; and top-heavy &#8220;A&#8221; but, spoiler, once you see that those shapes are inspired by the stout plastic chairs that people sit on while enjoying street food and drinks it takes on a whole new level of charming and appropriateness. I really wish the &#8220;G&#8221; were different and somehow more in tune with the other letters because then the logo would be a total home run. The updated blue and yellow makes the logo (and identity) a lot livelier and easy to spot.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/guta_custom_type_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Guta by M &#8212; N Associates\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/guta_custom_type_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Guta by M &#8212; N Associates\" \/>\n<figcaption>Custom typeface references.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>Featuring the chair and Vietnamese diacritical marks, we has developed a custom font named after Guta, FONTA (our font), only for the extension of Guta child brands and special communication tools. After their success on rebranding, Guta has been growing from several stores to nearly 60 stores around the city and opened new child brands like PH\u1edeTA (Ph\u1edf noodle) or CH\u1ee2TA (convenient local store).<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/m-n.associates\/work\/guta\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">M &#8212; N Associates project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/guta_custom_type_03.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Guta by M &#8212; N Associates\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/guta_custom_type_04.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Guta by M &#8212; N Associates\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/guta_custom_type_05.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Guta by M &#8212; N Associates\" \/>\n<figcaption>Custom typeface.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>As spoiled in the paragraph above, the logo and custom typeface are inspired by the unique shape of the stool\/chair that is so commonly used and provides a strange but delightful graphic reference. The resulting typeface is mostly great but the round characters (&#8220;C&#8221;, &#8220;G&#8221;, &#8220;O&#8221;, &#8220;Q&#8221;) stand out oddly. The numerals are awesome and the zero is more nicely resolved, which hints at what the &#8220;G&#8221; in the logo could have looked like. In general, what I like most about the typeface is that has a raw-ish vernacular aesthetic as if it were a hand-painted sign for a single store.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/389278174?title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"360\" height=\"203\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Typeface introduction video.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>Here&#8217;s the usual habit for kicking start of the day for everyone who loves street coffee. They sit on a plastic chair somewhere shady and surrounding with greens, with a cup of coffee and a newspaper. After finishing their news and coffee, they started hanging out or ready for work.<br \/><br \/>The halftone printing effect on newspaper was regarded as communicating visualization for the brand and echoed different characters who sit on plastic chair around the country, from office worker to lady hawker. All together, reflecting a unique yet familiar culture of Vietnam street coffee for Guta philosophy.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/m-n.associates\/work\/guta\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">M &#8212; N Associates project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/guta_newspaper_inspiration.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Guta by M &#8212; N Associates\" \/>\n<figcaption>Newspaper halftone pattern.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>Every character was selected carefully and representing a wide range of different characters from young to old, from blue collar to white collar.

The execution of applying it to people and then Photoshopping them to sit on the &#8220;A&#8221; is kind of crude and at first I didn&#8217;t like it but, like everything else so far, there is a weird charm to it and in its purposeful lack of sophistication is a welcome respite from the more common slick illustration styles we&#8217;ve been seeing over and over.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/guta_cards.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Guta by M &#8212; N Associates\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/guta_cup.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Guta by M &#8212; N Associates\" \/>\n<figcaption>Cups.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/guta_menu_folded.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Guta by M &#8212; N Associates\" \/>\n<figcaption>Menu.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/guta_menu_board.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Guta by M &#8212; N Associates\" \/>\n<figcaption>Menu board.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The applications are pretty good with big and bold type and colors.
