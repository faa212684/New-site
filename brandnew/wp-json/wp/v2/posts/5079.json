This Summer, Olympic Dairy introduced a new logo and packaging designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/lg2.com\/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">lg2<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/olympic_yogurt_old_look.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Olympic Dairy by lg2\" \/>\n<figcaption>Old look.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>&#8220;We looked to the brand&#8217;s location in beautiful BC and the positive energy that Canadians associate with the west coast for our inspiration. Nature, well-being, health, the sea and mountains, responsible consumption, wholesome food and balanced lifestyle &#8211; all these features also describe the Olympic family, especially as the entire range is natural and organic. It would have been a huge miscalculation to ignore Olympic&#8217;s origins and DNA. We instead decided to leverage the BC spirit and lifestyle to redefine the brand&#8217;s essence,&#8221; remarks Anne-Marie Leclair, Partner, Vice-President, Strategy, at lg2.<\/blockquote><h3>lg2 provided press release<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/olympic_yogurt_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Olympic Dairy by lg2\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo&#8230; yikes. I doubt they were trying too hard or thought they had a killer look, so we&#8217;ll give them a pass. The new logo pays homage to the snowy mountains found across British Columbia &#8212; perhaps specifically, because of the name, to the Olympic Mountains (although those are officially in the U.S., right on the border) &#8212; with a groovy serif featuring a snow-capped &#8220;M&#8221;. I like the idea and get what they are trying to do but I&#8217;m bothered by the snow looking like a sprinkling of pepper. By choosing to use the logo in white on dark backgrounds, the snow should not be &#8220;depicted&#8221;, instead it should be the visible pieces of rock that are depicted amidst the snow. So, in my mind, the top peaks of the &#8220;M&#8221; should be unfinished without an edge to give the impression of the snow covering completely the very top and slowly diffusing as it crawls down. Anyway&#8230; the logo is a major improvement and I love the wide serif that works perfectly in the top band of the packaging.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/olympic_yogurt_packaging_before_after.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Olympic Dairy by lg2\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/olympic_yogurt_packaging_before_after_2.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Olympic Dairy by lg2\" \/>\n<figcaption>Packaging, before and after.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old packaging did not elevate in any way the logo, instead it doubled down on swooshes and bad typography.
