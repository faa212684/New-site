Cheese<\/a> is a chain of restaurants aimed at kids &mdash; commonly for their hellish birthday parties &mdash; and offers &#8220;pizza, a salad bar, appetizers, desserts and a feature musical and comic entertainment by life-size, computer controlled robotic characters, family oriented games, rides, and arcade style activities.&#8221; Owned by CEC Entertainment, there are over 500 corporate-owned locations and 50 franchises in 48 states of the U.S. and seven other countries. As <a href=\"http:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/chuck-e-cheese-being-replaced-165852240.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AP reports<\/a>, Chuck E. Cheese has been having a rough year and is looking to boost sales. Chuck E. &mdash; the restaurant&#8217;s mascot since the beginning &mdash; to the rescue! Unveiled earlier this month, the rodent has gotten a drastic makeover, as drawn by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.chrisayersdesign.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Chris Ayers<\/a>, and will be the focus of a new advertising campaign by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.richards.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Richards Group<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/chuck_e_cheese_concept_art.jpg\" alt=\"Chuck E.

This is not to say that I feel nostalgic for Chuck E.; the damn thing has always been creepy and annoying, whether in logo form or in life-size costume or animatronic. While there has been mostly outrage online about the new look &mdash; sample comment from their Facebook page: &#8220;Chuck E. Cheese? This guy is more like Suck. E Cheese!&#8221; &mdash; there really isn&#8217;t anything wrong with him, other than trying to fit the mold of what one would perceive as a &#8220;cool kid,&#8221; which perhaps makes it a little generic. And it&#8217;s hard to argue that he doesn&#8217;t fit in better with today&#8217;s Pixar and Dreamworks worlds making him more relatable to kids and their parents. I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s all that great and I&#8217;m not sure if a makeover will boost sales at the restaurants&hellip; at the end of the day I just really hope none of my kids&#8217; friends have a party there that I have to take them to.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to Macauley Johnson for first tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_120724_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_120724_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"574\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,85,26],"tags":[491,233,139],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2061"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2061"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2061\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2061"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2061"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2061"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
