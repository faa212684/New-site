Originally the ground handling division of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.saudiacargo.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Saudia Cargo<\/a>, the leading provider of ground handling services for international air cargo carriers operating at the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia&#8217;s main international airports, SAL was created as a separate entity to expand from being solely ground handling into a full logistics company serving the Gulf area.

It seems so elemental once presented but it&#8217;s such a great &#8212; pardon the jargon &#8212; synergy between corporate naming and brand essence that doesn&#8217;t happen often. Interbrand has also done a fantastic job of translating sea, air, and land into abstractions of waves, planes, and train tracks that double as an &#8220;S&#8221;, &#8220;A&#8221;, and &#8220;L&#8221;, respectively when the units of the patterns are rotated and isolated. Even without that interpretation, which I didn&#8217;t get at first but only until I saw the video, the logo is really good, with a stencil design that looks as something you would see on the side of crates, trucks, and cargo containers but with a corporate, buttoned up vibe that makes the logo appear quite serious. I love how the squares that are part of the &#8220;S&#8221; and the &#8220;L&#8221; are the same and the overall rhythm and balance of the logo is so well achieved considering how relatively &#8220;awkward&#8221; the letters are. Even the \u00ae mark helps balance it all by neatly sitting in the top right corner filling in the wide counterspace left in the &#8220;L&#8221;. Long way of saying, I really like the logo.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sal_color_palette.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Color palette.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Also really digging the color palette.

I love how the logo snaps to the top of the layouts &#8212; which I know is asking for trouble in print products, but a render can dream &#8212; and the overall airiness of the layouts. I would like to see more pops of the plum color in there but that&#8217;s a minor quibble.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sal_pin.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Saudi Arabian Logistics by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Pin.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/396890180?title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"360\" height=\"203\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Identity introduction video.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">Overall, this is a great corporate identity that manages to be innovative and original but still very much within the comfortable visual language of business-to-business &#8212; in the Middle East no less &#8212; that makes it read as grown-up business people coming to the table to do serious business while some design blogger rejoices in the Midwest.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established at the end of 2019, Saudi Arabian Logistics (SAL) is a global logistics hub, which means that it provides ground handling and logistics services on a global scale linking land, air, and sea transportation and clearance to ensure the&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[76,12,26],"tags":[307,255,309,1215],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8540"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=8540"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8540\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=8540"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=8540"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=8540"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
