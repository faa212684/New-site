Previously named Bang PR (and with <a href=\"http:\/\/bpando.org\/2014\/09\/11\/logo-bang-pr\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this<\/a> identity), the company circled back to local firm <a href=\"https:\/\/re.agency\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">RE<\/a> who did the previous identity and helped them visualize their new name. For any of you that have pressed Command-Option-I in Adobe InDesign or Illustrator (or gone to the Type menu and selected &#8220;Show Hidden Characters&#8221;) the concept will be quickly evident and, maybe like me, will bring a smile to your face. I don&#8217;t know, however, if other than designers anyone knows what the invisible characters are for line break, hard break, or space. Still, it&#8217;s a lovely looking identity with a strong serif at the helm and some clever production techniques that help bring the concept to life, like clear varnishes and foils or an orange transparent sleeve that hides the orange characters. For typing purists, the space at the end of the logo might be sacrilege ; ) <a href=\"https:\/\/re.agency\/work\/#\/hidden-characters\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a> <span class=\"gray_70\">(Via<\/span> <a href=\"http:\/\/bpando.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BP&amp;O<\/a><\/span class=\"gray_70\">)<\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Little Italy by Here Design<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_littleitaly.jpg\" alt=\"Little Italy by Here Design\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/littleitalyjo\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Little Italy<\/a> is an all-day Italian dining food destination in Amman, Jordan, that houses a cafe, gelateria, restaurant, and pizzeria. Designed by London-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.heredesign.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Here Design<\/a>, the identity references Italian gelaterias and salumerias with a lovely script logo that is visually ready to be made into a neon sign. The signature &#8220;Little&#8221; is accompanied by equally lovely sans serif typography and a range of ornate seals for each of the location&#8217;s offerings. Although minimal, the applications and signage are decadently ornate with a great concoction of elements layered on top and around each other, all in a basic palette of blue, red, and white. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.heredesign.co.uk\/project\/little_italy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a> <span class=\"gray_70\">(Via<\/span> <a href=\"http:\/\/bpando.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BP&amp;O<\/a><\/span class=\"gray_70\">)<\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">5th Singapore International Photography Festival by H55<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_5thsipf.jpg\" alt=\"5th Singapore International Photography Festival by H55\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">Started in 2008, the <a href=\"http:\/\/sipf.sg\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Singapore International Photography Festival<\/a> is a non-profit biennial festival for Southeast Asian artists to showcase their photography alongside international peers. For its 5th edition, local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.h55studio.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">H55<\/a> got busy with the Command-Shift-3 by creating an identity where all the output is made from screenshots. Other than the title font, everything has a default look that&#8217;s exaggerated by being contained in OS X&#8217;s user interface. I love the little detail in the program where the folder is titled what the piece is. There is <a href=\"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/177872074\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a promo video<\/a> that gives the concept motion, which is also worth a watch. I&#8217;m not sure this is the most relevant concept for a photography festival but I definitely appreciate the execution and clever integration of the OS X UI and applications. Too legit to Command-Q. <a href=\"http:\/\/eyeondesign.aiga.org\/designing-a-photography-festival-campaign-with-screen-shots\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Just one restaurant this week and two keyboard-command-inspired projects with work from Sydney, London, and Singapore&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[906,393,564],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5069"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=5069"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5069\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=5069"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=5069"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=5069"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
