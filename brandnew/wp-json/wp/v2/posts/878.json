A PDF with a lot of bullet points and diagrams can be found <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dmi.org\/dmi\/html\/aboutdmi\/press\/DMI_Identity_Relaunch_Presentation.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve always felt as though I was overlooking something with the previous logomark, having seen it as some sort of eye\/globe\/latitutde-and-longitude mash-up and thus was unable to establish an easy visual connection or reference to &#8220;design management&#8221; &mdash; a phrase that has taken on diverse meanings in recent years with the emergence of design as a discipline in business management. But that&#8217;s another conversation. Though with a little stretch, one could draw out the idea of of a focal point inside a larger global context, or an emerging pattern or plan that could resonate as strategic. That being said, it is certainly a recognizable mark who&#8217;s visual clout had grown alongside the institute&#8217;s. <\/p>\n<p>Thomas Lockwood PhD, the President of DMI, on the new identity and strategic plan for expanding mission and global reach:<\/p>\n<blockquote>The idea of &#8220;connections&#8221; emerged throughout the collaborations, research, workshops, SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) analysis and interviews&hellip; DMI has a solid, international history and has made significant contributions to the field through thought leadership strategies like conferences, seminars, publications and case studies. DMI established a three-year vision and roadmap to optimally deliver these design management resources to an international community, and further develop the 34-year old organization.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/news.morningstar.com\/newsnet\/ViewNews.aspx?article=\/BW\/20090714005040_univ.xml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press Release<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p>The new identity was unveiled at the 2009 DMI Re-Thinking&hellip; Design conference in San Francisco, and described as reinforcing DMI&#8217;s commitment to &#8220;creating and sharing knowledge about design management and the role of design in business success.&#8221; As per our usual trajectory here, I&#8217;ve looked for a way try to make a comparative assessment of the previous visual identity with the latest redesign, but I&#8217;m at a loss. Perhaps the red pixelated cube is &#8220;sharing knowledge&#8221; with the dot on the &#8220;i&#8221; of &#8220;dmi&#8221; or vice versa? Perhaps. Though outside of this elusive connection, it is difficult to reconcile what the red pixelated cube or the red dot on the &#8220;i&#8221; of &#8220;dmi&#8221; has to do with design, management, business or the institute&#8217;s mission. Or perhaps I&#8217;m just not enlightened on design management. Perhaps not.<\/p>\n<h4>Thanks to Joe Meiring for the tip.<\/h4><br \/><br \/>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_20090714_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_20090714_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"188\", \"275\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_20090714_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_20090714_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"188\", \"275\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_20090714_config_03.xml&#038;xyz=poll_20090714_votes_03.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"188\", \"275\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv3\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        \t<!--VOTE 01-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n       \t\t<!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            \t<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE 02-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n       \t\t<!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            \t<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE 03-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv3\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":4,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,79,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/878"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/4"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=878"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/878\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=878"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=878"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=878"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
