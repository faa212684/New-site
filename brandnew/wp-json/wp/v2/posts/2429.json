Foundation<\/a> (W?F for short) was founded by cancer survivor Allison W. Gryphon, a novelist and filmmaker, with the goal to &#8220;help alleviate the fear and empower people to learn more and to fight&#8221; through a real and honest way to talking about cancer. It supports people &#8220;through their cancer fight on the ground level, day-to-day, hour-to-hour, minute-to-minute.&#8221; Allison is also working on the aptly titled documentary, <em>What the F@#- is Cancer? And Why Does Everybody Have It?<\/em>. A new identity for the foundation, introduced in February, was designed by New York, NY-based <a href=\"http:\/\/safarisundays.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Safari Sundays<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>Safari Sundays came up with a concept entitled &#8216;the fighter&#8217;.  The core identity serves as an attention-grabbing, edgy shorthand to the organization&#8217;s name (W?F) while representing the heart of The Why? Foundation; the many questions surrounding cancer.  The mark also serves a s a nod to the documentary film created by founder Allison W. Gryphon entitled <em>What the F@#- is Cancer? And Why Does Everybody Have It?<\/em> due to debut in the Directors Guild of America Director&#8217;s Finder Series this May.

It&#8217;s no pink ribbon, that&#8217;s for sure. And as much as there is value in that and the delicate management most cancer awareness organizations approach their branding with, it doesn&#8217;t work for everyone. This identity and the organization itself scream &#8220;Fuck you, cancer&#8221; and that can be as helpful an attitude as any. I also like the new shorthand version of the name, W?F, which is obviously a play on the now famous WTF? (&#8220;What the Fuck?&#8221; for the uninitiated) and reminds me of the, at the time, provocative name and campaign by fashion label French Connection UK, which pushed its &#8220;fcuk&#8221; acronym quite, um, hard in the early 2000s (late 90s?). (See some of that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=fcuk&#038;source=lnms&#038;tbm=isch&#038;sa=X&#038;ei=ZdFvUbCwDsaYqQHw9ICwCw&#038;ved=0CAoQ_AUoAQ&#038;biw=1433&#038;bih=833\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>As far as this logo goes, it uses the proven aesthetic of thick brush strokes to render the short name in an energetic, raw execution. It works. It&#8217;s bold and recognizable. The name of the organization is a little shy by comparison; I realize you can&#8217;t have too much boldness in there, but it still seems like a bit of a disconnect between the two things. In application, as mentioned, there is not much to it, but there doesn&#8217;t need to be: just slap the acronym, big, on stuff.
