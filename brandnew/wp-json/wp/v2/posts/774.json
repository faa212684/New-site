That being said, I still enjoy visiting shops like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.surlatable.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sur La Table<\/a> to see all the whiz-bang they have to offer. Sur La Table originally opened as a shop selling hard-to-find French kitchenware in Seattle&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pikeplacemarket.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pike Place Market<\/a>, but is now more akin to Starbucks than a Seattle indie joint.<\/p><!--more--><p>The previous wordmark is set in Roger Excoffon&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mistral_(typeface)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mistral<\/a>, a script face that still manages to look fresh more than 50 years after its creation and, in the American context, a rather ownable wordmark. The update feels as vibrant as its predecessor &mdash; clearly a play out of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sudtipos.com\/fonts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ale Paul&#8217;s<\/a> genius book &mdash; but more common in today&#8217;s type landscape where brush-influenced scripts are flourishing. It&#8217;s certainly beautiful, with a bit more gracefulness than the original through its lighter brush feel and use of white space. And the deep purple helps contrast and legibility. All that said, I&#8217;m not sure if this is an improvement. The previous mark had a sense of originality, time and place while not looking dated, whereas the new mark is set in what is now a familiar and trendy style. Perhaps simply updating the color palette would have been enough.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":4,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,86,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/774"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/4"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=774"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/774\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=774"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=774"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=774"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
