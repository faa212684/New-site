No design credit given.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Update:<\/strong> Logo and core packaging were designed by Seattle, WA-based Tether &mdash; their project page <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tetherinc.com\/work\/celestial-seasonings\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a>. The loose leaf boxes and ready-to-drink bottles were designed in-house.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>Our purpose for these new boxes was simple: make it even easier for you to find your favorite Celestial Seasonings flavors without losing sight of what made you love them in the first place.<br \/><br \/>We know that a lot of folks shop for our teas by the character on the box as much as the name, so our refreshed packaging spotlights those characters even more than previous boxes. The tea name is also much more prominent and easier to read, and our new logo is clear and memorable.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.celestialseasonings.com\/learn-about-us\/fresh-new-look\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Celestial Seasonings new look page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/celestial_seasonings_2015_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Celestial Seasonings by Tether\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>I had always enjoyed the previous Celestial Seasonings look, it was like modern-day Victorian packaging with an unapologetic lack of white space and overwrought illustrations and filigreed logo. The logo in particular wasn&#8217;t great as that holding shape filigree is as default as it gets but it fit perfectly on the boxes. The new logo maintains some of the elements of the old one &mdash; like the big &#8220;C&#8221; and &#8220;L&#8221; and &#8220;I&#8221; tucked under the flourishy &#8220;T&#8221; &mdash; with somewhat questionable typography. It looks like a sans serif with nubby serifs tacked on. The letterforms lack some fluidity and feel stiff despite being set on a curve. The swirly &#8220;T&#8221; could have worked but it contrasts too much in the wrong way with the rest of the letters. And that star&hellip; I would have tried to find a way to make it come from the large swath of empty space between the &#8220;I&#8221; and &#8220;A&#8221; instead of cramming it where it is. It&#8217;s an okay logo from afar but up close it doesn&#8217;t hold up.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/celestial_seasonings_2015_packaging_before_after.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Celestial Seasonings by Tether\" \/>\n<figcaption>Packaging, before and after.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/celestial_seasonings_2015_packaging_detail.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Celestial Seasonings by Tether\" \/>\n<figcaption>Packaging detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/celestial_seasonings_2015_packaging_various.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Celestial Seasonings by Tether\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/celestial_seasonings_2015_packaging_detail_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Celestial Seasonings by Tether\" \/>\n<figcaption>A few more samples.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/celestial_seasonings_2015_packaging_hero_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Celestial Seasonings by Tether\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/celestial_seasonings_2015_packaging_hero_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Celestial Seasonings by Tether\" \/>\n<figcaption>A couple of hero shots from Celestial Seasonings.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The new packaging is definitely more suited for this era and it&#8217;s easier to read overall with clear hierarchy and fields of color to help segment information. The silhouetted illustrations look great and create a lot of airiness to the new look. And they remain weird as hell in some flavors.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/celestial_seasonings_2015_kombucha.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Celestial Seasonings by Tether\" \/>\n<figcaption>Kombucha range.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/celestial_seasonings_2015_latte.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Celestial Seasonings by Tether\" \/>\n<figcaption>Bottled chai.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/celestial_seasonings_2015_concentrate.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Celestial Seasonings by Tether\" \/>\n<figcaption>Concentrate chai.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/celestial_seasonings_2015_loose_leaf.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Celestial Seasonings by Tether\" \/>\n<figcaption>Loose leaf blends.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">The new look extends to a whole range of products in varying degrees of success &mdash; chai bottles\/concentrates? yay! loose-leaf earthy boxes? nay! &mdash; that come across as a family even when elements change. Overall, this is a springy redesign that brings Celestial Seasonings into the present even if it sacrifices looking like some of the other color-coded, white-spaced packaging on the shelves.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"First sold in 1969 as loose-leaf blends in local health food stores in Boulder, CO, and growing into a multi-million-dollar operation, Celestial Seasonings is a tea company offering over 70 unique varieties of tea including herbal, green, black, wellness, Rooibos&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,51,26],"tags":[39,53,411,710],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4287"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4287"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4287\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4287"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4287"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4287"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
