It will be a relatively drastic layout change but the content format will remain mostly the same. I would love to hear some feedback about what you like or don&#8217;t like about the experience of reading Brand New on your desktop, laptop, or mobile. I&#8217;m looking more for technical, objective, opinions on how the site looks and works vs. philosophical feedback about what to post or not post (although, if you must, feel free to share that too). Don&#8217;t worry about hurting my feelings&#8230; but don&#8217;t be a jerk either. I don&#8217;t guarantee all feedback will be reflected in the new version but I do guarantee all will be taken &#8212; wait for it &#8212; under consideration.<\/p>\n<p>My goal is to have a new version in the next 3 to 4 months, depending on workload which might extend the launch date into Summer&#8230; but hopefully not.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"I have started working on the next iteration of Brand New based on a few needs we have to accommodate more content (yay!) while fixing some layout things that have been bothering me for the past couple of years.
