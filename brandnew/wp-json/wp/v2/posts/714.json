Tropicana, another one of the Pepsi brands, has also gone under the knife&hellip; or the juicer. This is perhaps the least offensive work we&#8217;ve seen come out yet but it certainly pales in comparison to the previous line of packaging designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/sterlingbrands.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sterling Brands<\/a> that hit the shelves no more than one or two years ago at the most. This new packaging feels, at best, like a discount store brand with what looks like, again, at best, rights-managed stock photography if not outright royalty free.
