Brand New has grown into one of the most popular blogs about identity design and many, many people in the industry around the world &mdash; from interns, to creative directors, to principals &mdash; turn to us for the latest work. To their (and my own) dismay everyone is consistently disappointed by the ensuing commentary, and while some may actually enjoy the car-wreck aspect of it, it has become, in some instances, too bile and hurtful. This is unacceptable.<\/p><!--more--><p>Like any person who runs a blog, I enjoy seeing the comment counts rise to 50, 70, 100 and more, but the truth is that no more than a quarter of those comments are worth reading. The main trend in comments is to say &#8220;this sucks&#8221; or some other alternative mode of pithy, ruthless offense. This stops now. Unless you have a substantiated and thoughtful response to why something, in your mind, &#8220;sucks&#8221; please do not comment at all. From now on all comments along the lines of &#8220;fail,&#8221; &#8220;this looks like student work,&#8221; or &#8220;the designer should be fired,&#8221; will be deleted at my own discretion without notification or explanation.<\/p>\n<p>Another unacceptable trend is making personal attacks or slurs against any designer or design firm. Whether it&#8217;s Landor, Wolf Ollins, Paula Scher or Peter Arnell, calling them names or judging their personal character &mdash; <em>specially<\/em> when, in most likelihood, you don&#8217;t even know them in person &mdash; is off limits. These comments too will be deleted without notification or explanation.<\/p>\n<p>If I, at any point, have engendered these kind of comments by my writing, I hope that you let me know too in this thread, so that I can, myself, be more careful. I resort to sarcasm and irony more often than not but I believe I attempt to do so with reasoned commentary that does not rely on mere offense.<\/p>\n<p>Anonymous comments are unavoidable I guess, but please understand that this practice is considered cowardly and simply stupid, specially when someone is being offensive. If you can&#8217;t back up your words with a real name, handle, e-mail or web site, please don&#8217;t bother commenting here, you are not welcome. These comments will be deleted too.<\/p>\n<p>The one thing you need to consider before posting a negative critique is to think how you would feel if someone wrote the exact thing about you and your work. If you can&#8217;t handle it, it&#8217;s unlikely someone else will enjoy it.<\/p>\n<p>If this post loses Brand New a few hundred comments, visitors and pageviews a month, so be it, I prefer to sacrifice traffic over quality.
