Recently the organization announced a new strategy (&#8220;Skills for Life&#8221;) and a strategic plan through 2023. Along with these, Scouts introduced a new identity designed by London, UK-based <a href=\"http:\/\/notonsunday.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NotOnSunday<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>NotOnSunday have been working closely with the team at Scouts to create a bold new brand and visual identity, focusing on skills for life as their key benefit. As part of the re-brand we&#8217;ve refreshed the Scouts logotype, to reflect a more relevant image of Scouting, while still retaining its strong heritage, including the iconic fleur-de-lis.<br \/><br \/>It was important for us that we created a brand that was fun and exciting whilst retaining strong links to its heritage. We did this through creating a new contemporary fleur-de-lis that will be immediately recognisable, and more usable in print, fabric and digital. Along with extensive guidelines we worked with the team to create a series of brand templates that follow a simple and adaptable system for the Scouts members to use.&#8221;<\/blockquote><h3>NotOnSunday provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/scouts_uk_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for The Scouts Association by NotOnSunday\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/scouts_uk_logo_icon_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for The Scouts Association by NotOnSunday\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icon detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/scouts_uk_logo_color_variations.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for The Scouts Association by NotOnSunday\" \/>\n<figcaption>Color variations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo was bad, looking like a really lame car racing event with its obnoxiously-big swoosh, questionably large and wildly spaced ellipsis, italic everything, and squared-off wordmark. The new logo is a major improvement, with a minimalist fleur-de-lis better suited for all kinds of applications and sizes that still maintains its fleur-de-lis-ness without all the usual visual fanfare they carry around. I like the simplicity of the icon and the center shape is great but I would question if the two sprouts on the sides needed a little extra curl. The wordmark is fine, nothing surprising, and friendly-looking enough. The kerner in me wants to pull that last &#8220;s&#8221; closer to the &#8220;t&#8221;. Nonetheless, the combo of icon and wordmark works well with a good contrast in thickness between them and when the logo has a location underneath I like how that smaller type matches in weight with the icon.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/scouts_uk_brochure.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for The Scouts Association by NotOnSunday\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brochure.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/scouts_uk_binder.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for The Scouts Association by NotOnSunday\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/scouts_uk_binder_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for The Scouts Association by NotOnSunday\" \/>\n<figcaption>Folder and materials.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/scouts_uk_postcard.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for The Scouts Association by NotOnSunday\" \/>\n<figcaption>Leaflet.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/scouts_uk_localized_materials.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for The Scouts Association by NotOnSunday\" \/>\n<figcaption>Localized materials.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/scouts_uk_namebadge.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for The Scouts Association by NotOnSunday\" \/>\n<figcaption>Name badge.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/scouts_uk_posters.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for The Scouts Association by NotOnSunday\" \/>\n<figcaption>Posters.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/scouts_uk_banners.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for The Scouts Association by NotOnSunday\" \/>\n<figcaption>Banners.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/scouts_uk_ads_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for The Scouts Association by NotOnSunday\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/scouts_uk_ads_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for The Scouts Association by NotOnSunday\" \/>\n<figcaption>Ads.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The applications are all fairly straightforward relying on photography of kids and young adults being scout-y, which is hard to argue against. The layouts could use a little something extra somewhere somehow. It&#8217;s all just centered type or left-aligned type and that&#8217;s it. It&#8217;s understandable that you don&#8217;t want to overcomplicate things for an organization with 8,000 locations all trying to produce materials that need to look like they belong with each other but maybe one moment of layout flair could have been beneficial.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/scouts_uk_instagram.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for The Scouts Association by NotOnSunday\" \/>\n<figcaption>Instagram account.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/scouts_uk_pins.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for The Scouts Association by NotOnSunday\" \/>\n<figcaption>Pins.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/scouts_uk_sweatshirt.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for The Scouts Association by NotOnSunday\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sweatshirt.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/scouts_uk_tshirt.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for The Scouts Association by NotOnSunday\" \/>\n<figcaption>T-shirt.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/I0NSyX5Td5g\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Mini film by <a href=\"http:\/\/3angrymen.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">3angrymen<\/a>.
