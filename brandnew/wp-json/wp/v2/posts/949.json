Which just goes to show that I&#8217;m neither Canadian nor good at accruing miles. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.airmiles.ca\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Air Miles<\/a> is a very popular reward program in Canada where everyday purchases made at or with participating products or services add up to coveted, well, air miles for some much desired traveling. According to <a href=\"http:\/\/ottawastart.com\/story\/9994.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this article<\/a>, two thirds of Canadian households participate in the Air Miles program. That&#8217;s a lot. While Canada seems to be the most successful Air Miles, the program (and brand) runs independently in other parts of the world, like the UK, Spain and the Netherlands. The company isn&#8217;t that old, it was established in the mid 1980s, but its logo, and specifically the plane in its logo, looks like, indeed, it has been flying all this time.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/airmiles_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"Air Miles Logo, Detail\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Between the rackety-looking plane and the italic serif on a curve, the old logo was looking seriously dated but it clearly had equity and resonance with customers. Toronto based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ovedesign.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ove Design<\/a> did a nice job of evolving the logo into something more contemporary and fresh. The plane looks more aerodynamic and stable, the &#8220;AIR MILES&#8221; typography is more refined and the tag line, even though it remains a little awkward, is a better rendition. The glow in the sky and the globe give it a nice, uplifting vibe too &mdash; and since the logo lives on 4-color plastic cards, the web and other full color applications I have no issues with the gradients, and still, I&#8217;m sure this logo would reduce great to a 1- or 2-color application. Overall, a crisp, rewarding evolution.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.decostainc.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">John Godfrey<\/a> for first tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_20091016_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_20091016_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"574\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[60,9,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/949"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=949"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/949\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=949"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=949"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=949"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
