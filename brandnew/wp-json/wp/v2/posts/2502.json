Over 50 years of construction and development, Vietcombank made important contributions to the stability and development of Vietnam&#8217;s national economy, by serving as a role model for major foreign banks, effectively serving local economic development, and creating significant impact to the financial community and global regions. From a specialized bank for foreign economic relations, Vietcombank today has become a multi-bank with multi-disciplinary activities, providing customers a full range of financial services in the field of international trade, and in traditional activities such as treasury, capital mobilization, credit, project finance &hellip; as well as an array of modern banking services: foreign exchange and derivative duty, card services, electronic banking.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Design by:<\/strong> N\/A.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Ed.&#8217;s Notes:<\/strong> Very American\/global.

The letter V in the logo was redesigned as a modern, stylized icon, linked throughout, demonstrating a successful sustainable connection. It not only symbolizes <em>V<\/em> VCB but also a symbol of the spirit to win (<em>V<\/em> victory), the union of the heart with faith comes from the heart for a shared future with the prosperity of Vietnam.&#8221;<\/p>\n<!--IF THERE IS ADDITIONAL IMAGES OR A VIDEO PLACE HERE-->\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/vietcombank_big.jpg\" alt=\"Vietcombank\" \/><\/p>\n<!--IF THERE IS SOMEONE TO THANK PLACE HERE-->\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to Jerome Meyer for the tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_vietcombank_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_vietcombank_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"574\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,37,25],"tags":[441,319,886],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2502"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2502"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2502\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2502"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2502"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2502"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
