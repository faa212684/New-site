It is the Greek yogurt of choice at UCllc headquarters. Chobani has grown so much, it became an official sponsor of the US Olympic Team in 2012. Aside from making super delicious yogurt, Chobani is a super awesome and generous company: among other perks, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2016\/04\/27\/business\/a-windfall-for-chobani-employees-stakes-in-the-company.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ulukaya gave all of the employees shares<\/a> in the company in 2016 to share the riches if and when the company goes public (or it sells). Positioning themselves for further yogurt-market-dominance, Chobani yesterday <a href=\"http:\/\/www.chobani.com\/next10years\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">introduced<\/a> a new identity and packaging designed in-house, led by Leland Maschmeyer, who joined the company &#8212; after co-founding and working for many years at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wearecollins.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Collins<\/a> &#8212; in 2016 as Chief Creative Officer.<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/chobani_old_look.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Chobani done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>A sampling of the old look.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/chonabi_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Chobani done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/chobani_brand_architecture.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Chobani done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brand architecture.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/chobani_identity_elements.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Chobani done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Identity elements.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Despite an intense affection for this yogurt I always disliked its old logo. The heavily geometric wordmark with the Art Deco-ish aesthetic felt too harsh, fragmented, and cold in contrast to the smooth, creamy texture and flavor of the product. The new wordmark manages to capture that feel-good sensation of the product in a rich, smooth, curvy, chunky serif that looks absolutely fantastic. Drawn by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bertonhasebe.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Berton Hasebe<\/a> &#8212; who also designed the extended type family in collaboration with Christian Schwartz of <a href=\"https:\/\/commercialtype.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Commercial Type<\/a> &#8212; the new wordmark is the best-in-class, end-of-the-road example of the slowly rising trend of serif typography, particularly of the 1970s, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.myfonts.com\/fonts\/urw\/windsor\/?refby=ucllc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Windsor<\/a>-esque realm. I think it is literally and absolutely perfect not just in execution but in representing the product. The green color is unexpected but it looks stunning on the typography and more so in the packaging.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/chobani_product_photography.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Chobani done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Product photography.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/chobani_lifestyle_photography.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Chobani done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Lifestyle photography.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/chobani_culinary_photography.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Chobani done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Culinary photography.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The brand&#8217;s new photography style, and overall presentation, has an <em>Am\u00e9lie<\/em>-meets-Norman Rockwell-meets-Works Progress Administration aesthetic that feels earthy, nostalgic, and wholesome but without being cloying.

Too generic and it felt&#8230; distant which, again, seemed contrary to the niceness of the company. Like the new logo, I also love the new packaging. It feels like the wholesome boyfriend or girlfriend you want to bring home to meet your parents. It has a very classy look and the new off-white background color makes a huge difference in adding warmth to the packaging.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/chobani_family.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Chobani done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Family of products.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video controls><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/chobani_new_look_intro.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>New look introduction video.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/chobani_32oz.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Chobani done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>32oz range.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/chobani_5oz.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Chobani done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>5oz range.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/chobani_drink.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Chobani done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Drinkable range.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/chobani_hint_of.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Chobani done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>A Hint Of&#8230; range.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/chobani_smooth_yogurt.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Chobani done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Smooth range.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The illustration work across the family of products is amazing, striking a great balance of quirkiness and seriousness, and abstracting each fruit just enough that it feels expressive but not too artsy fartsy.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/chobani_flip.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Chobani done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Flip range.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video controls><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/chobani_flip_intro.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Flip introduction video.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The one product range that feels off is the Flip, which looks like its aimed more at children.
