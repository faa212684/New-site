Sometimes pills, maybe music, or even a nap. For designers, it occurs when we see a nice redesign of a tried and true brand. Unfortunately this isn&#8217;t the case for the redesign of the headache medicine, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.excedrin.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Excedrin<\/a> &mdash; a pain reliever that has been around since the 1960s and just underwent a package makeover. The new color palette is toned down from the disjointed colors of the old. It is much easier to choose which product you need at first glance now that the design highlights the product name. There is also a tag line change from &#8220;The Headache Medicine&#8221; to &#8220;The pain stops.

The swooshes just seem so generic looking &mdash; fitting for the category, I suppose &mdash; and this being a name-brand drug you would think a little more originality would be displayed. I wonder if anyone would switch to Excedrin because it looks updated. Is there a psychology behind the products we buy based on good design or brand name, or is price the driving factor? Or, when it comes to pain relieving, whatever gets rid of the damn pain? I guess only time will tell, but for now I&#8217;ll stick to my generic drugs.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Thanks to Stacy Rausch for the tip.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":15,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,51,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/542"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/15"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=542"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/542\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=542"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=542"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=542"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
