One vision, one team, one identity. We have created a visual system that is founded on strong principles and values. The strength of one symbol now unites our team, our nation and our Olympic Family.<br \/><br \/>Our national colours, inspired by the wattle have been intensified and energised. The design salutes our native animals who are always moving forward and the star represents our states and territories- from coast to coast, top to bottom.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/rio2016.olympics.com.au\/team\/our-story\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AOC redesign story<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/australia_olympic_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Australian Olympic Committee\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/australia_olympic_logo_secondary.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Australian Olympic Committee\" \/>\n<figcaption>Secondary logos.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>For 120 years, the AOC&#8217;s and team&#8217;s logo has been a rendering of <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Coat_of_arms_of_Australia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Australia&#8217;s coat of arms<\/a> that shows a shield packed with stuff, surrounded by wattle (the national floral emblem), and flanked by a kangaroo and an emu. Paired with the Olympic rings, the logo is an embroidery nightmare and if there is one place where embroidery is a big deal it&#8217;s athlete uniforms at the Olympics. The change to a simpler logo is not just a production boon but a better separation of sport and state, particularly since the AOC is not a government branch. The new logo isn&#8217;t highly imaginative. It&#8217;s still a depiction of the coat of arms but it keeps the most recognizable elements of the kangaroo, emu, and seven-pointed Commonwealth Star. In deep green against bright yellow, it makes for an apt, solid, recognizable logo. The typography could have been more distinctive somehow or less dry. At the very least more loosely spaced.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/australia_olympic_team_color_palette.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Australian Olympic Committee\" \/>\n<figcaption>Color palette.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/australia_olympic_team_angle.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Australian Olympic Committee\" \/>\n<figcaption>Some kind of rationalization about the angle used throughout. Hey, it&#8217;s 78.5&deg;, can&#8217;t argue with that.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/australia_olympic_team_spread_stars.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Australian Olympic Committee\" \/>\n<figcaption>Southern Cross graphic.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/australia_olympic_team_business_cards_emboridery.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Australian Olympic Committee\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business card and&hellip; embroidery sample.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/australia_olympic_team_brochure.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Australian Olympic Committee\" \/>\n<figcaption>Various materials.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">In application, there is nothing too inspiring but it&#8217;s all solid. There are some structural angles that come from the shape of the &#8220;A&#8221; in the word &#8220;Aspire&#8221; which do add a bit of tension to the layouts and it&#8217;s hard to argue against large photos of Olympic athletes being sporty. The addition of the Southern Cross graphic is a good way to add an extra layer of graphic-ness and Aussie-ness. Overall, about what you would expect from an Olympic team &mdash; stately, simple, and IOC-friendly.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1895, the Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) is a non-government, not-for-profit organization, committed to the development of youth and sport and responsible for developing and promoting the Olympic Movement in Australia.
