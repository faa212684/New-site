Originally owned by and operating as a branch of Skandiabanken AB, itself a part of Skandia, a large financial and insurance conglomerate with operations in Sweden, Denmark, and Norway. In 2015 Skandiabanken was spun off as an independent company and, as part of the restructuring, it had to eventually change its name. Which it did this November, changing to <a href=\"https:\/\/sbanken.no\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sbanken<\/a> and introducing a new identity designed by Oslo, Norway-based <a href=\"https:\/\/bleed.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bleed<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>Sbanken&#8217;s visual identity revolves around your sphere, with main focus on you, your family, your friends and the whole society. It is about connecting, and creating a banking experience that is simple, rebellious and open.<br \/><br \/>The circle is representing the fact that Sbanken is there for you, regardless of where you are today, or where you are headed tomorrow. It\u00b4s is a bank that gives you the freedom to choose, with the knowledge that the bank will work for you, towards finding the best solutions.<br \/><br \/>As a result, Sbanken has received a new name and a new visual identity that maintain a strong core concept, which focuses on the banks main values of being simple, rebellious and open.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/bleed.com\/work\/sbanken\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bleed project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sbanken_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Sbanken by Bleed\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sbanken_dot_to_logo_animation.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Sbanken by Bleed\" \/>\n<figcaption>Dot\/wordmark structure.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/sbanken_transition_animation.mp4\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo\/name transition animation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sbanken_monogram.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Sbanken by Bleed\" \/>\n<figcaption>Monogram.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video controls><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sbanken_logo_animation.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo animation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo was an extension of Skandia Group&#8217;s logo so, graphically, there wasn&#8217;t much to it other than a decent extension of the typographic language already in place but, structurally, it took advantage of the colon in Skandia&#8217;s logo that, it seems, all this time had been waiting for a companion. The new logo is, in a way, the opposite of the Skandia logo, moving to a thin sans serif and a blue color but keeping a circle\/dot element that&#8217;s at the center of the identity.<\/p>\n<p>The new logo is a cool, deadpan, slightly hipstery sans serif with ample counterspaces &#8212; which is what I feel makes it interesting and takes it beyond the too-cool-for-school sans serif trend &#8212; and a dot separating the &#8220;S&#8221; from &#8220;banken&#8221;. The one really weird thing is that the &#8220;S&#8221; is like 5% bolder than the rest of the letters and it&#8217;s caused me a sleepless night thinking about why that is. Nonetheless, I&#8217;m still attracted to the logo and the &#8220;S\u2022&#8221; monogram on its own is quite handsome and works as a great shorthand for the bank.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video controls><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sbanken_other_animations.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>A sampling of other animations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video controls><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sbanken_custom_type.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Custom type.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sbanken_business_cards.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Sbanken by Bleed\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sbanken_name_badge.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Sbanken by Bleed\" \/>\n<figcaption>Name badges.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sbanken_credit_cards.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Sbanken by Bleed\" \/>\n<figcaption>Credit cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sbanken_blade_sign.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Sbanken by Bleed\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sign.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sbanken_tote.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Sbanken by Bleed\" \/>\n<figcaption>Tote bag.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The applications are crisp and striking.

Nonetheless, the overall vibe of the identity does come across as being contemporary and digital-led in contrast to traditional banks.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 2000, Skandiabanken is an internet-based, digital-first bank in Norway.
