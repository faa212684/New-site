Future Finance is facilitating access to education through its proprietary lending platform, which factors granular data on continuation, employability and earnings into its lending decisions, enabling it to lend to students who in many cases would not be able to obtain loans from banks. Future Finance provides loans to undergraduates and postgraduates of between \u00a31,000 and \u00a340,000 each academic year to help them pay for tuition costs and living expenses. Loan periods are for up to ten years after graduation although borrowers can settle early at any time, with no early repayment charges, and reduce the amount of interest that they pay overall. Loans include up to four payment holidays of three months, which provide students with flexibility as they establish their careers. Representative APR 11.2% APR (variable). Future Finance is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority.&#8221;<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/future_finance_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Future Finance by DesignStudio\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/future_finance_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Future Finance by DesignStudio\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo with perspex shapes.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/future_finance_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Future Finance by DesignStudio\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/future_finance_05.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Future Finance by DesignStudio\" \/>\n<figcaption>Website.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/future_finance_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Future Finance by DesignStudio\" \/>\n<figcaption>Ad.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/future_finance_04.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Future Finance by DesignStudio\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brochure cover.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/future_finance_06.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Future Finance by DesignStudio\" \/>\n<figcaption>Un-open-able folder.
