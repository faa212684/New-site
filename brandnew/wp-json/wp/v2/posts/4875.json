Its flagship beer is the ESB (Extra Special Bitter) but it counts with a few other year-round selections, like an IPA, as well as seasonal offerings and has just added an American pale ale to its roster. Earlier this year, Redhook introduced new packaging designed by Portland, OR-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sasquatchagency.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sasquatch Agency<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/redhook_esb_evolution.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for Redhook by Sasquatch Agency\" \/>\n<figcaption>Evolution of the ESB bottle.

Its perspective-heavy logo is the constant and that&#8217;s the one intrinsic element. The new labels bring back to life the original design for the brewery&#8217;s flagship ESB beer and is now applied to all others. Although it has one or two more strokes than necessary around the logo and beer name, the badge-like design is quite pleasing and feels much more like a traditional beer than the 2011 redesign. The typography is very well handled throughout.<\/p>\n<p>When the labels deviate from the original design and year-round beers as in the Blackhook, Summerhook, and Winterhook labels, things start to get sloppy with some very questionable &#8220;drop caps&#8221; with arrows and alternate patterns in the background. (I <em>really<\/em> don&#8217;t get the arrows.) I wish these bottles that extend the visual language of the revived labels were a lot better, adding to the charm and nuance of the originals.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/redhook_beer_2016_cans.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for Redhook by Sasquatch Agency\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/redhook_beer_2016_cans_irl.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for Redhook by Sasquatch Agency\" \/>\n<figcaption>Cans, render and real life.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The cans look really great, although I&#8217;m not sure why the green ones have a white stripe at the top, since the full-covered red one looks so much better.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/redhook_beer_2016_stickers.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for Redhook by Sasquatch Agency\" \/>\n<figcaption><a href=\"https:\/\/store.redhook.com\/products\/pack-of-stickers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Stickers<\/a>.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/redhook_beer_2016_6pack_single.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for Redhook by Sasquatch Agency\" \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/redhook_beer_2016_6pack_double.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for Redhook by Sasquatch Agency\" \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/redhook_beer_2016_6pack_triple.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for Redhook by Sasquatch Agency\" \/>\n<figcaption>6-packs.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/redhook_beer_2016_6pack_irl.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for Redhook by Sasquatch Agency\" \/>\n<figcaption>6-pack in real life.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/redhook_beer_2016_12pack.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for Redhook by Sasquatch Agency\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/redhook_beer_2016_12pack_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for Redhook by Sasquatch Agency\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/redhook_beer_2016_12pack_irl.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for Redhook by Sasquatch Agency\" \/>\n<figcaption>12-packs, from renders to real life.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">6- and 12-packs don&#8217;t offer much in addition to repeating the badges on all surfaces, which is not a bad thing as the badges look great against all those large fields of color. Overall, this redesign makes Redhook look like it&#8217;s been around the 35 years that it has, whereas the previous design looked like it was trying too hard to compete with the onslaught of craft beers and now also capitalizes on the current trend in reviving visual elements from companies&#8217; and products&#8217; origins.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Not much has changed about Redhook since I last wrote about it in April 2011, so I&apos;ll recycle some of the opening: Founded in 1981 in Seattle, WA, Redhook is a craft beer brewery with a devoted following not just&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,51,26],"tags":[442,1122,1302,53,1303,526],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4875"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4875"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4875\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4875"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4875"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4875"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
