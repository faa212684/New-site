What? <em>You<\/em> come up with another word that sounds like that. In absence of some first-hand opinion, that I think some of our Canadian readers might be able to share, here are some facts: According to a 2006 census, Regina is the 16th largest city in Canada with a population of less than 200,000; as the capital of Saskatchewan, Regina is the second largest after Saskatoon, and has a lively business and cultural health. But it had a terrible logo. This past February, the City of Regina introduced a new logo designed by out-of-province <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mckimcg.ca\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">McKim Cringan George<\/a> in Winnipeg.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>To help Regina organizations promote the personality of the dynamic prairie city externally, MCG developed several creative elements. The new logo is composed of an infinity loop twisted into an &#8220;R&#8221; letterform unique to the City of Regina. Vividly coloured &#8216;design flourishes&#8217; illustrate how Regina&#8217;s people are connected, united and committed to elevating the city to new heights in the drive toward future investment, growth and opportunity. And the &#8220;Infinite Horizons&#8221; positioning statement additionally positions Regina and surrounding landscape as innovative, boundless and full of potential.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mckimcg.ca\/work\/city-regina\/branding\/city-regina-rebranding.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">McKim Cringan George Project Page<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/city_of_regina_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"City of Regina\" \/><\/p>\n<blockquote>The new City of Regina logo is composed of an R letterform as a distinctive focal point, unique to the city of Regina. Created with a continuous infinite loop in bold colours, the letterform is intended to position Regina as alive and vibrant &mdash; a place of endless possibility.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.infinitehorizons.ca\/2010\/02\/08\/regina-branding-q-a\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Regina Branding Q &amp; A<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/city_of_regina_brochures.png\" alt=\"City of Regina\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Not that this is earth-shattering, but I like that they are positioning this as a &#8220;Community Brand&#8221; more than a destination brand or an identity just for the city<\/p>\n<blockquote>The fact that it can be used by more than one organization, and will come to represent those organizations, as well as the community as a whole. It&#8217;s a unique way to approach branding that can only work in communities where there is strong connectivity and cooperation among the organizations that choose to adopt it. Partners in the initiative must be committed to put aside competitiveness and be prepared to speak in a strong, united voice, working towards the common goal of positively promoting our city.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.infinitehorizons.ca\/2010\/02\/08\/regina-branding-q-a\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Regina Branding Q &amp; A<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/city_of_regina_letterhead.png\" alt=\"City of Regina\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Enough quoting. The R icon is definitely attractive and eye-catching. While there could probably be a few more twists, both literally and metaphorically, in the ribbon to make the dimensionality work a little better, I think it&#8217;s a fairly convincing result. I like how the color changes at each twist and the overall shape is fluid and organic. The typography is acceptable and although it isn&#8217;t my favorite type in the world, there is nothing to really fault there. The ribbon as visual element in the identity materials can start to feel very clich&eacute; when it wraps around buildings, but it is a nice extension of the logo. As far as city logos go, this one is quite inviting.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to Fredrick Douglas for the tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_100428_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_100428_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_100428_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_100428_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,64,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1088"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1088"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1088\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1088"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1088"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1088"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
