Those who don&#8217;t can be found on the spotless <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/groups\/copenhagenmetro\/pool\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">metro<\/a> where all passengers seem to have rolled out of a cryonic spa on their way to a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nasa.dk\/site_content.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">super-secret club<\/a> to sip Carlsberg with other blindingly blond models, rockstars, and royal friends of the welfare state. The capital city of nearly 2 million is composed of delicately packed mansions, apartments and commercial buildings which are mostly human-scale and in impeccable condition. Apart from the occasional Lutheran spire or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.copenhagenet.dk\/CPH-RoundTower.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">round tower<\/a>, there is a striking absence of high rise and brutal modern boxes, and the city is hosting a renaissance of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cphx.dk\/index.php?language=dk&#038;id=37934#\/37934\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">great<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.operaen.dk\/Subsites\/Operaen.aspx?sc_lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">architecture<\/a>.

Surprisingly, three of the five selected firms pitched variations of the OPEN concept, but PeopleGroup&#8217;s design was selected for its ease of use as a campaign.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"open_more_buttons.jpg\" src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/open_more_buttons.jpg\" width=\"470\" height=\"576\" \/><\/p>\n<p>[Hint: make real buttons, hand them out, take real pictures of real Copenhagenites wearing them! <a href=\"http:\/\/www.buttonbiz.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">button-makers are really cheap<\/a>]<\/p>\n<p>One can imagine that the campaign will evolve over time, but in some of the preliminary brand applications the non-sequitur imagery varies wildly from being clich&eacute; to painfully inaccessible (the brain, html, horizontal lines). However, even faux buttons work as a populist icon; they signify a personal, discrete mode of expression, protest, or endorsement. Presumably, the intention was for these buttons take on a life of their own as virtual spokespeople in their own right. Even if buttons and rounded type become unfashionable someday, this campaign will continue to resonate for the city.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"open_apps.jpg\" src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/open_apps.jpg\" width=\"470\" height=\"332\" \/><\/p>\n<p>BONUS: You may enjoy translating this <a href=\"http:\/\/www.opencopenhagen.com\/Open\/InEnglish.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Danish Brand Book<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><em>The title of this post owes an apology to<\/em> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.shakespeare-literature.com\/Hamlet\/4.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">&#8220;Hamlet&#8221;, Act 1 scene 4<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Thanks to Thomas Christensen for the tip.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":8,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[64,12,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/837"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/8"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=837"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/837\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=837"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=837"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=837"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
