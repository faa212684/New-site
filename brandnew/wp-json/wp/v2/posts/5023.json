We believe in the &#8216;butterfly effect&#8217;, which states that even very small, seemingly insignificant things can trigger monumental effects on a global scale.<br \/><br \/>The butterfly is directly derived from the logotype Sigfox. If you look closer, you&#8217;ll see more than a beautiful budding insect. The Sigfox logo combined the mathematical purity of geometric forms with the friendly, and approachable style. Our new logotype is set in a custom, geometric sans-serif typeface and maintains the multi-colored of our logotype.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/brand.sigfox.com\/presentation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sigfox brand microsite<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sigfox_logo.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Sigfox by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sigfox_logo_geometry.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Sigfox by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Geometry.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sigfox_logo_color_variations.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Sigfox by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Color variations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo had the right idea: a butterfly constructed from a thread of connection-ish lines of some digital kind but masking the lines inside a butterfly silhouette was the lazy way out. You have to custom-arrange them to fit the shape and create a unified element. The wordmark was interesting in its funkiness and it almost paired well with the icon but the overall combination of elements was not cohesive.<\/p>\n<p>The new logo maintains the butterfly and adds a heavy-handed dose of concept with galaxies coming together to form it. It&#8217;s actually a decent concept and very appropriate for the market but I won&#8217;t deny there is not a bit of eye-rolling in its admiration for its own grandeur. Still, the resulting icon is sharp and recognizable as a butterfly without being cloying. The single-color, stroke version of the icon is surprisingly effective. The wordmark is mostly fine, except for the &#8220;f&#8221; where the crossbar looks like the outstretched arm of a zombie.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sigfox_subbrands.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Sigfox by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sub-brands.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Golf clap. The sub-brands are very nicely extended into a wide range of variations. This looks &#8220;easy&#8221; but it&#8217;s really hard to do well.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sigfox_logo_elements.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Sigfox by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo\/identity elements.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>[The Living Rings] symbolize the two spheres we live in &#8211; our physical and digital worlds.

Smoother animations in the video at the top.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>I expected to dislike the rings because they feel like a basic graphic device that you would put on modem packaging or some other connecting device but they have used them quite well by exaggerating their size within the layouts and always keeping the strokes thin.

The &#8220;brochure system&#8221; image is so satisfying because it conveys the flexibility of a system that is coherent across variations. Overall, it&#8217;s a very strong identity that fits the industry and, while it speaks a similar visual language of other technology and telecommunications, it stands out for its crisp and well thought-out execution.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 2009, Sigfox is a leading provider of &quot;dedicated communications service for the Internet of Things&quot; by providing a network that is a &quot;simple, economical, energy-efficient two-way transmission of small quantities of data over long distances&quot; that connects things&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,26,88],"tags":[1094,46,255,374,1231],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5023"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=5023"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5023\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=5023"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=5023"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=5023"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
