Originally housed in attics across the city, the museum has had its own building since 1950 and was renovated in the late 1990s. A permanent collection and exhibit, &#8220;Making of a Nation&#8221;, showcases more than 2,000 objects from the Icelandic Age of Settlement (c. 870 &#8211; 930) to today and over 1,000 photographs from the twentieth century. Recently, the museum introduced a new identity designed by Reykjav\u00edk-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jl.is\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jonsson &amp; Lemacks<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/siggiodds.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Siggi Odds<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>The aim of the identity was to bring this renowned institution into the modern age by transforming it into a clear, cohesive, vibrant and inspiring brand, with its feet planted firmly in the past but always looking forward, inviting a larger target group to learn and take part in Iceland&#8217;s heritage.<\/blockquote><h3>Siggi Odds provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/national_museum_of_iceland_logo.png\" alt=\"New Identity for National Museum of Iceland by Jonsson &amp; Lemacks and Siggi Odds\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>While the logo basically stayed the same, it&#8217;s worth noting what a big difference it made to switch to a single color, making the sword-sail-thing more bad-ass. I am told, also, that the icon contains a negative &#8220;\u00de&#8221;, which is the initial for the Icelandic name, \u00dej\u00f3\u00f0minjasafn \u00cdslands. The new wordmark is not the most exciting but it complements the icon a lot better and doesn&#8217;t look like a default font choice as in the old logo. The key orange-red color is quite nice too.<\/p>\n<blockquote>The visual identity is typographically driven, utilising a custom headline typeface which includes 4 historical typefaces. The typefaces are inspiring glimpses from Iceland&#8217;s cultural heritage: Fu\u00feark runes, used from the 9th century; Fraktur or calligraphic lettering, used in our famous manuscripts and sagas from the 12th century; H\u00f6f\u00f0aletur (Head letters), a carved ornamental lettering from the 16th century, and sans serif typography, used in printing and digital techniques from the 19th century to the modern day.<br \/><br \/>The typographical system works almost as an educational puzzle, as the letters are interchanged for the baseline sans serif typeface, so by reading the headlines you are learning to read these historical types of writing and hopefully making you curious to learn more about Icelandic culture and heritage.<\/blockquote><h3>Siggi Odds provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/national_museum_of_iceland_typography_introduction.gif\" alt=\"New Identity for National Museum of Iceland by Jonsson &amp; Lemacks and Siggi Odds\" \/>\n<figcaption>Typographic expression.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/national_museum_of_iceland_type_sources_01.gif\" alt=\"New Identity for National Museum of Iceland by Jonsson &amp; Lemacks and Siggi Odds\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/national_museum_of_iceland_type_sources_02.gif\" alt=\"New Identity for National Museum of Iceland by Jonsson &amp; Lemacks and Siggi Odds\" \/>\n<figcaption>Two of the historical typefaces (all four are shown in the video at the end).<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The hook of the new identity is a custom font that mixes a barebones sans serif with four historically significant alphabets. This is a clever way to infuse the identity with Iceland&#8217;s history, striking a strong balance of old and new. The spare use of the historical characters in each word or sentence nicely highlights them while also keeping them readable &#8212; certainly, some are harder than others but I think the audience can fill in the blanks when needed. Execution-wise, I like how deadpan it is and not trying to be overly cool or design-y, making it look very matter-of-fact as if this were a normal font.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/national_museum_of_iceland_annual_pass.jpg\" alt=\"New Identity for National Museum of Iceland by Jonsson &amp; Lemacks and Siggi Odds\" \/>\n<figcaption>Annual pass.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/national_museum_of_iceland_brochure_cover.jpg\" alt=\"New Identity for National Museum of Iceland by Jonsson &amp; Lemacks and Siggi Odds\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brochure cover.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>A vibrant colour palette based on manuscript pigments, as well as a contemporary photographic style elevate the key objects from the exhibition to pop culture icon status, making them a relevant alternative to other entertainment in the modern time, not just competing with other museums, but even movie posters or clothing ads.<\/blockquote><h3>Siggi Odds provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/national_museum_of_iceland_ads_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Identity for National Museum of Iceland by Jonsson &amp; Lemacks and Siggi Odds\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/national_museum_of_iceland_ads_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Identity for National Museum of Iceland by Jonsson &amp; Lemacks and Siggi Odds\" \/>\n<figcaption>Ads\/posters.
