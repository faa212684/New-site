Providing bachelor, masters, and postgraduate degrees as well as vocational training and continuing education, CETT currently has over 2,400 students enrolled &#8212; 25% of them from outside Spain &#8212; and a network of nearly 20,000 alumni. After its first 50 years, CETT has introduced a new identity designed by the Barcelona office of <a href=\"https:\/\/wearemucho.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mucho<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>It is through experiences that we connect with the world and with others, that we live. The aesthetic experiences that all three &#8211;Tourism, Hospitality and Gastronomy&#8211; provoke is what binds these areas together. The word experience in itself bears resemblance to the educational richness, growth and transformation that a student has exposure to during their time at CETT, both personally and professionally.<br \/><br \/>&#8220;Through experiences&#8221; is, therefore, the tagline of the brand and sits at the core of the brand narrative and identity. When accompanied by verbs, the tagline becomes a living organism that supports the key messages of the brand: Grow through experiences, connect through experiences, learn through experiences, open minds through experiences, are but a few examples of these.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/wearemucho.com\/project\/cett\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mucho project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video controls controlsList=\"nodownload\" poster=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cett_intro_movie.jpg\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cett_intro_movie.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo introduction video. It meanders, a lot, before getting to the point.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Both the quotes about the design and the video above are a little too philosophical for a school about tourism, hospitality, and gastronomy and I&#8217;ll admit that I was a little put off by both &#8212; I would have accepted &#8220;We thought this looked cool, so we ran with it&#8221; instead. With that out my system, let&#8217;s continue&#8230;<\/p>\n<blockquote>The circle is the main element of the new brand identity. It represents the transformation of the student into a professional, but it also represents an open look, a new perspective.<br \/><br \/>The circle is used both as a container, either with pictures or textures inside, or as a graphic element. The latter shifts the focus to the surrounding content, becoming the circle a more explicit representation of the brand logo.<br \/><br \/>The circle &#8211;with its pictures, textures and variable positions for letters&#8211; highlights the importance of values like flexibility, dynamism and adaptability, which are a fundamental part of the culture at CETT.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/wearemucho.com\/project\/cett\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mucho project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cett_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for CETT by Mucho\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cett_logo_architecture.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for CETT by Mucho\" \/>\n<figcaption>Primary logo and sub-brands.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cett_logo_with_images.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo with images.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo would have been great for a computer-related vocational school. It wasn&#8217;t great and it wasn&#8217;t terrible other than in its default-looking typography but someone, somewhere, at some point had a semi decent visual idea with that &#8220;E&#8221; and the ligature &#8220;T&#8221;s. The new logo, in its barebones application, is okay. The composition of the CETT letters around a circle is interesting enough although a little confusing as to why only the &#8220;C&#8221; changes color as it interacts with the circle. The wordmark is fine and because of how long the name is, the simple sans serif approach is perfectly appropriate here. Let&#8217;s move on to the more vivid applications of the logo.<\/p>\n<blockquote>The rich palette of the brand represents life and the abstract world of senses, delivering a vivid visual experience. The differentiation between the programmes employs a unique set of three colours and textures, designed as graphic resources, that also support a variety of corporate communication.<br \/><br \/>This versatility facilitates the adaptation of the brand to all sorts of environments, particularly digital ones. It is the digital-native generation that is now experiencing CETT. Their world is one of textures, movement, and sound; and so, to fit in and be embraced the brand needed to behave accordingly.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/wearemucho.com\/project\/cett\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mucho project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cett_color_palette.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for CETT by Mucho\" \/>\n<figcaption>Color palette.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cett_textures_all.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for CETT by Mucho\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cett_texture_02.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for CETT by Mucho\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cett_texture_03.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for CETT by Mucho\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cett_texture_01.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for CETT by Mucho\" \/>\n<figcaption>Textures.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cett_logo_gradient_animation.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<hr \/>\n<div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cett_logo_bars_animation_a.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<hr \/>\n<div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cett_logo_blobs_animation_b.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo with the different textures.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Let&#8217;s first talk about the textures: I have no idea what&#8217;s going on or what they have to do with tourism, hospitality, and gastronomy but, heck, I love looking at them, especially in motion. The colors also seem wrong and uninviting as they relate to tourism, hospitality, and gastronomy but, heck again, I really like the combination. The textures contained inside the circle, which also grows an inner shadow in these versions, look pretty cool. I still don&#8217;t quite get the logic of what letter does what as it crosses the circle &#8212; some shift and react to the shadow, others nothing happens to them. Anyway, did I mention I enjoy looking at these?<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cett_covers.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for CETT by Mucho\" \/>\n<figcaption>Covers.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cett_ads_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for CETT by Mucho\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cett_ads_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for CETT by Mucho\" \/>\n<figcaption>Out of home ads.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cett_folder.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for CETT by Mucho\" \/>\n<figcaption>Folder.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cett_tote_tshirt.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for CETT by Mucho\" \/>\n<figcaption>Tote and t-shirt.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cett_signage.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for CETT by Mucho\" \/>\n<figcaption>Signage.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cett_supergraphics.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for CETT by Mucho\" \/>\n<figcaption>Supergraphics.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cett_instagram_posts.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Instagram posts.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cett_various_applications_grid.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Various digital applications.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">The applications have a good variety to them, integrating imagery into the circles and backgrounds or just relying on the textures. The best ones are the applications with the softer gradients &#8212; like, that folder, the most pared down of renders, is the one that looks the most convincing &#8212; and, to me, the applications with the thick bar texture look kind of cheap and messy. Overall, I think with some reigning of graphic design impulses this could be pretty good. I&#8217;m not sure if this works for this school but then again I really don&#8217;t know what kids in tourism, hospitality, and gastronomy are into these days.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1969, CETT (which originally stood for Centro de Ense\u00f1zas Tur\u00edsticas, Center for Tourism Teachings) is a leading higher education school for Tourism, Hospitality, and Gastronomy, affiliated with the University of Barcelona.
