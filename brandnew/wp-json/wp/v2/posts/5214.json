Indiatimes is one of many brands under the <a href=\"http:\/\/timesinternet.in\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Times Internet<\/a> umbrella, the largest Indian internet network and the digital venture of Times of India, India&#8217;s largest media and entertainment group. Late last year, Indiatimes introduced a new logo and identity designed by New Delhi-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.weareanimal.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Animal<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>The brand came to us with a simple proposition &#8211; &#8220;Let&#8217;s be relevant. Also, let&#8217;s be cool.&#8221; Our way forward became obvious &#8211; to set up a platform without the frills and fluff of conventional media. And the first task was snipping away at the name:<br \/><br \/>Discarding the unnecessary bit.<br \/>Indiatimes is now it.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.weareanimal.co\/indiatimes\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Animal project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/203419003?title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo process and presentation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/india_times_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Indiatimes by Animal\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/india_times_it_logo_grid.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Indiatimes by Animal\" \/>\n<figcaption>Grid.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo took its negative kerning seriously with every round character overlapping heavily with the one to its left&#8230; they almost pulled it off, had they made the thin overlap lines and actual kerning more equal but from that first &#8220;in&#8221; pair, it wasn&#8217;t right. The new logo is a drastic departure, first by getting rid of the full name and going simply with &#8220;it&#8221; and then by choosing a somewhat challenging logo that is not the easiest to digest or even use. I actually like it a lot as it&#8217;s completely different from any major web publication and has a bold energy that feels like 1980s MTV and Bloomberg News had a baby. I keep wanting to see some relevant shape in the counterspace of the &#8220;i&#8221; and &#8220;t&#8221; as its so pronounced and my eye keeps going there. The logo is a tight unit that works perfectly on the site and needs no shortened monogram to exist on social media.<\/p>\n<blockquote>This color palette effectively utilizes the key colors and justifies the supporting hues. Pink, blue, green, and yellow are the hero colors that serve well in being vibrant, popping and purpose-driven.<br \/><br \/>Great, since it works well for posters, enormous titles, books and shimmy stuff, the highly contrasted butler typeface is pleased to be at your service.

The business cards have a good thing going with the &#8220;Love it&#8221;, &#8220;Work it&#8221;, &#8220;Feel it&#8221; lock-ups and the airiness but then the front is super clunky. The line patterns (like on the tape) are somewhat arbitrary and then, where they might match the emanating lines of the tote graphic, they don&#8217;t. Overall, the logo sets the right tone for the identity but it needs more polishing and reigning in. Still, it&#8217;s great to see some risk-taking for a media brand in India.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Launched in 1998, Indiatimes is one of the most popular news and media websites in India, covering politics, sports, music, health, Bollywood, business, entertainment, automobiles, and technology, or, in their words, &quot;smart, intelligent and quirky content from around the world&quot;&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,26,91],"tags":[785,292,617,386,850],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5214"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=5214"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5214\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=5214"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=5214"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=5214"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
