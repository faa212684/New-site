Their name is a combination of the Italian word for brain, <em>cervello<\/em>, and the French word for bicycle, <em>v\u00e9lo<\/em> &#8212; basically, &#8220;brainbike&#8221;. Offering seven different series, ranging from road bikes to track cycling performance bikes, all of their products are nerdily engineered and are very well regarded by everyone from casual weekend riders to professional athletes (with whom they have had plenty of successful sponsorship partnerships). At the beginning of this year, Cerv\u00e9lo started rolling out a new identity designed by Toronto-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.concrete.ca\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Concrete<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>As part of a broader initiative, the company engaged Concrete to update its brand to reflect the highly-engineered quality of Cerv\u00e9lo&#8217;s products as well as its status as a global leader in the sector.<br \/><br \/>The challenge was made more complex with the need to create a compelling singular brand voice while appealing to Cerv\u00e9lo&#8217;s broad and diverse audience &#8211; Road, Track and Triathlon &#8211; all of whom had divergent sensibilities and attitudes. The entire brand was evaluated and updated &#8211; brand positioning and tagline, visual identity, product branding and segmentation, photography and brand style.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.concrete.ca\/case-study\/cervelo\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Concrete project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cervelo_logo_comparison.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Cerv\u00e9lo by Concrete\" \/>\n<figcaption>Before and after logo comparison.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cervelo_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Cerv\u00e9lo by Concrete\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cervelo_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Cerv\u00e9lo by Concrete\" \/>\n<figcaption>Hot accent detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>At first glance the old logo wasn&#8217;t that bad but once you hit rewind and pause, man, it was a wreck. Amid all the wonkiness, though, were some good bones, which the new logo has amazingly unearthed to create an excellent wordmark that maintains the equity of the original but now is as nerdily engineered as the bikes themselves. Removing the ball terminal from the &#8220;c&#8221; and the &#8220;r&#8221; is probably the best move as the flat endings of those letters creates a stronger horizontal line with the &#8220;e&#8221;s and the revised accent over the second &#8220;e&#8221; along with the taller &#8220;l&#8221; is so good. Maybe it&#8217;s too much praise, but this is a perfect evolution and does it ever look good on them bikes.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cervelo_logo_on_bike_horizontal.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Cerv\u00e9lo by Concrete\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo on bike.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cervelo_logo_on_bike_details.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Cerv\u00e9lo by Concrete\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo on bike, details.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cervelo_typography.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Cerv\u00e9lo by Concrete\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cervelo_typography.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Typography, including the custom Cerv\u00e9lo Gothic.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cervelo_wild_postings.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Cerv\u00e9lo by Concrete\" \/>\n<figcaption>Wild postings.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cervelo_various_applications.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Cerv\u00e9lo by Concrete\" \/>\n<figcaption>Various applications.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cervelo_RoadTriTrack.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>&#8220;Road&#8221;, &#8220;Track&#8221;, and &#8220;Tri&#8221; type treatments, used to differentiate their three main audiences: Road, Track, and Triathlon.

The only odd thing is using the &#8220;\u00e9&#8221; as the standalone letter for a monogram&#8230; I understand that it&#8217;s the more curious of all the letters and one that stands out but with such a nice new &#8220;c&#8221; I do wonder why they didn&#8217;t use that instead.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cervelo_bikes_with_van.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Cerv\u00e9lo by Concrete\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cervelo_in_action_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Cerv\u00e9lo by Concrete\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cervelo_in_action_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Cerv\u00e9lo by Concrete\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cervelo_in_action_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Cerv\u00e9lo by Concrete\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cervelo_in_action_04.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Cerv\u00e9lo by Concrete\" \/>\n<figcaption>Various shots of the bikes in the wild, with the new logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">Overall, this is a solid update from start to finish, hitting all the right notes and making this look like a top performance product and brand.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1995, Cerv\u00e9lo is a Toronto, Canada-based manufacturer of racing and track bicycles founded by Dutch and Canadian engineers Gerard Vroomen and Phil White.
