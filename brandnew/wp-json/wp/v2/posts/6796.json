The festival takes place in Karlovy Vary, a picturesque spa town in the Czech Republic and attracts over 11,000 audience members along with 300 directors, filmmakers, and actors; 800 distributors and agents; and 700 journalists. It is a competitive film festival &#8212; as accredited by the International Federation of Film Producers Associations &#8212; and presents 200 films from around the world. The identity for the festival changes each year and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.najbrt.cz\/en\/work\/filtr\/klient\/film-servis-festival-karlovy-vary\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">since 1995<\/a> it has been designed by Prague, Czech Republic-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.najbrt.cz\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Studio Najbrt<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>The 53rd edition&#8217;s visuals suddenly return to a simple typography that builds on nostalgia for celluloid, or more generally, analog.

Both were pretty great, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.najbrt.cz\/en\/detail\/51st-karlovy-vary-iff\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">especially the 2016 edition<\/a> where all the subjects in the photographs were depicted as hiding from the paparazzi. This year, it was all about the typographic &#8220;53&#8221; that was created from an abstracted film strip where its perforations form the tiny counterspaces that shape the numbers. And it is brilliant. Sure, it&#8217;s unconventional and relatively difficult to read but for an audience of cultured film-festival-goers it&#8217;s perfectly fine. The &#8220;53&#8221; is paired with Neue Haas Grotesk, which serves as the straight man in this duo.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/53rd_program_catalogue.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 53rd Karlovy Vary International Film Festival by Studio Najbrt\" \/>\n<figcaption>Program and catalogue covers.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/53rd_kiff_program.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 53rd Karlovy Vary International Film Festival by Studio Najbrt\" \/>\n<figcaption>Program.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/53rd_kiff_program_bag.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 53rd Karlovy Vary International Film Festival by Studio Najbrt\" \/>\n<figcaption>Program and bag.

Overall, as a one-time identity for a film festival &#8212; as opposed to a long-term corporate identity &#8212; this is pretty much perfect with a relevant concept that turns a clich\u00e9 into an exciting visual system.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"First celebrated in 1946, the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival (KVIFF) is one of the oldest film festivals in the world and the largest and most important in Central and Eastern Europe.
