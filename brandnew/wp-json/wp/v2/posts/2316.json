Established in 2009 with the merger of Perdig&atilde;o (est. 1934) and Sadia (est. 1944), <a href=\"http:\/\/www.brasilfoods.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BRF<\/a> (originally BRF Brasil Foods) is one of the world&#8217;s largest food companies managing some of the most popular consumer product brands in Brazil like the previously eponymous Perdigao and Sadia, and Batavo, Elege, and Qualy. BRF operates over 50 production facilities and distribution centers and employs more than 115,000 people. This past January they introduced a new identity designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.interbrand.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Interbrand<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.a10.com.br\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A10<\/a>, the latter responsible for BRF&#8217;s previous identity.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>The BRF logo has been created to represent our essence. The adopted symbol represents the globe with all its cultural, social, territorial and racial diversity. The new brand strategy expresses our positioning and objective of cultivating bonds, bringing lives closer together, thus incorporating elements which are the essence of BRF: Has Energy; Is a protagonist; Cultivates bonds; Dialog with the world.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/brf---announcement-to-the-market-187098721.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press Release<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/brf_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"BRF Logo\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The old logo was fine although I&#8217;m not sure what the holding shape for the &#8220;F&#8221; was meant to be: an eclipse about to happen? A rising sun with some kind of metaphor for business? Or, simply, a cookie with a bite taken out of it? I like the latter. Now, call me crazy, but I really like the new logo. There is something very appealing about the texture created inside the circle. It&#8217;s totally generic and gratuitous but it has pretty colors, fractal-ey shapes, and is interestingly asymmetric. Even the &#8220;brf&#8221; wordmark with its weird construction has some redeeming qualities (two of which are not that counterspace in the &#8220;b&#8221; &mdash; yikes &mdash; or the pure black choice). I would love to see some applications of this, as I think there is great potential in that texture. Overall, a nice, edgy improvement over the old logo.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to Yuri M Emygdio for the tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_130204_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_130204_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_130204_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_130204_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,36,26],"tags":[146,148,33,335],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2316"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2316"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2316\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2316"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2316"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2316"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
