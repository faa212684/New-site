The identity, designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.table-six.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Table Six<\/a>, features two logos: An ornate Tuscan-esque wordmark that clearly reads &#8220;ARCHIE&#8221; and a layered monogram that very difficultly reads as &#8220;ARCHIE&#8221; &mdash; A, R, H, and I are at the center, C and E are on the sides &mdash; but is nonetheless both beautiful and badass and my favorite aspect of this project. The dark blue and red color palette adds a sense of luxury and mystique. It&#8217;s all very medieval-sexy.  <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/28677193\/Archie\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Ankori by Firmalt<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_ankori.jpg\" alt=\"Ankori by Firmalt\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ankoritea.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ankori<\/a> is a new brand of tea products and tea culture based in the city of Apizaco, Tlaxcala in Mexico. Like Archie, this identity designed by Monterrey, Mexico-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.firmalt.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Firmalt<\/a>, also relies on two logos: a simple wordmark with exaggerated curves on the few lines that cut horizontally on the letters and an icon that represents the shape of the flower Camellia Sinensis created from the structure of the wordmark&#8217;s &#8220;K&#8221;. (A handy animated GIF at the link explains this better). Both are simple, elegant, and offer a hint of Asian serenity, which is all part of the vibe. The teas have a nice packaging system that mixes watercolor-y illustrations anchoring the bottom of heavily white-spaced labels and boxes. The typography on the labels is a little confusing and going in many visual directions but the hipster-clinical aesthetic manages to come across well. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/31828865\/Ankori\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Amie Bakery by Peck &amp; Company<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_amiebakery.jpg\" alt=\"Amie Bakery by Peck &amp; Company\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amiebakerycc.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amie Bakery<\/a> is, well, a bakery in the village of Osterville, Massachusetts, in Cape Cod. Its focus on warmth and community comes across delightfully in the identity designed by Nashville, TN-based <a href=\"http:\/\/peckandco.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Peck &amp; Company<\/a>. While we see a lot of this Victorian approach it&#8217;s always a pleasure to see it done right. The tall wordmark with the dense striping looks great when printed in metallic or emblazoned on a mug or soft-hued on wrapping paper. The typography around the main wordmark is perfectly done and the complementary, diamond-shaped pattern used throughout the materials completes the effect of a bakery caught in another era. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/29210293\/Amie-Bakery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/strong><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Today we have a similar range of selections with plenty of serifs and ornamentation &mdash; and clients that all begin with &#8220;A&#8221; &mdash; with work from Jakarta, Monterrey, and Nashville&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[1065,580,710],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4418"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4418"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4418\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4418"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4418"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4418"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
