I first became aware of the NFF when one of our clients worked with them to establish a growth prospectus and while designing some materials for our client I couldn&#8217;t help but notice what a poor identity for such an important organization the NFF had. This past August, NFF released a new identity, designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cgpartnersllc.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">C&amp;G Partners<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><p>Although the old logo appears here with its full name, it&#8217;s more common to find the acronym logo floating around by itself, making it unclear what they do &mdash; for an organization that&#8217;s not clear-cut what they actually do you could say that&#8217;s a detriment. One of C&amp;G&#8217;s first recommendations was to embrace the full name:<\/p>\n<blockquote>To design the new logo, C&amp;G Partners addressed several key communication challenges. The first task was the name. The seemingly contradictory relationship between &#8220;nonprofit&#8221; and &#8220;finance fund&#8221; needed to be addressed and clarified through the design process. Since the full breadth of NFF&#8217;s services is not immediately apparent nor universally known, &#8220;the new identity needed to establish a link between the organization&#8217;s analytical, strategically focused, financial expertise and its warm, humane, aspirational culture and mission,&#8221; explained Leslie Sherr, Director of Brand Strategy.<br \/><br \/>Partner and Brand Identity Practice Lead Steff Geissbuhler responded to this set of dualities through a reconfigured name that alters the emphasis of the words, accompanied by a symbol that speaks to their interconnectedness. The full name &mdash; &#8220;Nonprofit Finance Fund&#8221; &mdash; was separated, stacked and aligned flush right, creating a clear distinction between the organization&#8217;s main clients &mdash; Nonprofits &mdash; and its offerings &mdash; captured by &#8220;Finance Fund.&#8221;<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/note.php?note_id=269214345416\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press Release<\/a> (on Facebook)<\/blockquote>\n<p>Replacing the clunky NFF logo is an elegant and serious icon that pairs a solid pyramid structure with a subtly organic flame. I&#8217;m more of a symmetrical person myself so the first thing that jumped out was that there were five flames to four steps, creating a slight imbalance. But I can see why creating some tension was desired, perhaps to make it less square (not as in the shape but as in the adjective). Call me nostalgic, but it&#8217;s nice to see a strong icon that is neither literal nor relying on visual pyrotechnics that, with a little bit of effort from the viewer, one can derive his or her own meanings. But for the record:<\/p>\n<blockquote>A symbol was added to this stacked arrangement that connects two seemingly disparate shapes &mdash; a cool, dark gray, pyramid and a soft, warm, undulating flame &mdash; which refer to the organization&#8217;s expertise and mission. The distinction &mdash; and interdependence &mdash; between the two sides is reinforced in the new tagline: Where Money Meets Mission. The two-color orange and gray solution is also appropriately modest for a sector that stretches each dollar as far as it will go. The supporting sans serif typeface, Univers, brings consistency across all touch points, including advertising, print and online communications.<\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nff_stationery.jpg\" alt=\"NFF\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nff_business_card_detail.gif\" alt=\"NFF\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Stationery (above) and back of business card detail.<\/p>\n<p>In action, the icon serves as a defining axis whether it is small, as in the web site, or large as in the business card above or the guidelines below.
