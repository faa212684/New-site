The name comes from a combination of three towns: <em>Wa<\/em>vre, <em>Li<\/em>mal, and <em>Bi<\/em>&egrave;rges &mdash; the kangaroo character reportedly came after Mee&ugrave;s&#8217; son noticed that a wallaby looked like a kangaroo. The parks were purchased by Six Flags in 1998, then sold to British investment company Palamon Capital Partners in 2004, then to Compagnie des Alpes in 2006, who own a wide range of amusement parks across Europe. Earlier this year, Walibi unveiled a complete new look and Walibi-themed universe in collaboration with multiple specialists in animation, marketing, merchandising, and more. The identity was designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.figtreenetwork.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FigTree<\/a> in Paris. The site NewsParcs <a href=\"http:\/\/newsparcs.blogspot.com\/2011\/01\/walibi-new-leading-brand-of-family.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">has the complete story in detail<\/a>. <\/p><!--more--><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"574\" height=\"353\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/NmTqi4Ajl0U?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<br \/><br \/>\n<p class=\"caption\">A great, in-depth look at the whole process.<\/p>\n<p>The main idea is to create a whole music-based story around Walibi, who has a band called W.A.B. (Walibi&#8217;s Adventures Band). He also has a twin brother who is his opposite and has a band called The Skunx. They battle. Musically. It may not be your grown-up idea of fun, but this ain&#8217;t for you, it&#8217;s for teenagers. There are also movie spin-offs and concerts in development. Everything looks well realized and the villains look like fun.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/walibi_and_squad.jpg\" alt=\"Walibi\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Walibi, left, and his more evil twin brother Squad, right.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/walibi_good_guys.jpg\" alt=\"Walibi\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Walibi&#8217;s bandmates, Zenko, Fibi, and Haaz.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/walibi_bad_guys.jpg\" alt=\"Walibi\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Squad&#8217;s evil bandmates, Motiv (how awesome are his shoes?!) and Loco.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/walibi_costume.jpg\" alt=\"Walibi\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Costumes. Creepy, but less so than Barney the purple dinosaur.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/walibi_logo_detail.jpg\" alt=\"Walibi\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Regarding the logo&hellip; The old one was more <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=GEbz6kvnQDA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wally World<\/a> than world-class, twenty-first century entertainment, so the revitalized look is much needed. And it&#8217;s pretty cool too. The Walibi dude is a little too slick for me, but that&#8217;s not a demerit at all, just personal preference. The custom wordmark is energetic, fun, and very well executed. The &#8220;W&#8221; has enough of a superhero look and I bet it looks great on a t-shirt. Overall, this is a great overhaul of a 25-year-old brand that doesn&#8217;t only make design sense but will probably be excellent business too.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/walibi_hor.png\" alt=\"Walibi\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.commixx.nl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Marc Nijborg<\/a> for the tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_110216_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_110216_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_110216_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_110216_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,66,26],"tags":[253,108,165,472,233],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1347"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1347"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1347\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1347"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1347"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1347"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
