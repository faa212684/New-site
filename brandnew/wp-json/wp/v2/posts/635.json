The original logo was designed by Wally Olins in 1988 through his namesake Wolff Olins, and the outstretched man was inspired by a Greek bas relief sculpture hosted at the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ashmolean.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ashmolean Museum in Oxford<\/a> chosen &#8220;as both a scientific and an artistic symbol, reflecting the values it wanted to express &mdash; those of striving and achievement.&#8221; The new identity was also designed by Wally Olins, now through his new company, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.saffron-consultants.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Saffron<\/a>. The old logo was clunky at best, even if metaphorically strong, so the redesigned male of unidentified race or political inclinations is a welcome evolution to the concept &mdash; although it seems more fitting for a healthcare organization than a decorative paints producer, but I am willing to take the leap of faith. The accompanying typography is enjoyable and foregoes the all-lowercase trend, proving that it&#8217;s possible to appear accessible and friendly while maintaining a corporate demeanor.
