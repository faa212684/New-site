But you already knew that. Just stating the obvious for the record. Last year, almost to the date, Audi introduced the flat version of their logo and while tips floated in and out of my inbox there was no concrete case study about it nor did it seem like something that was going to stick for the long run. Earlier this year, though, Audi published a very comprehensive, very nicely crafted <a href=\"http:\/\/www.audi.com\/ci\/en\/renewed-brand.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">brand portal<\/a> that explains the identity approach in detail. The project was carried out collaboratively by Stuttgart- and Berlin-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.strichpunkt-design.de\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Strichpunkt<\/a>, Munich-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.black.space\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BLACKSPACE<\/a>, and Munich-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kms-team.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">KMS TEAM<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>For Audi we have developed a corporate design, which is consistently \u00bbdigital first\u00ab in its concept and design. We took a truly holistic, interdisciplinary approach to creating design principles for all media and devices.<br \/><br \/>The new brand appearance is flexible and modular in the sense of the \u00bbatomic design\u00ab, rules are reduced to a minimum. In this way, today&#8217;s and future devices can be designed so that an overall brand experience is given. At the same time it allows plenty of scope for creative diversity.<br \/><br \/>The result is a modern design and interaction principle for Audi. Dynamic principles replace rigid rules. The brand portal we designed has gone online in early 2017. It is accessible to everyone &#8211; an innovation in the automotive industry, and a symbol of new openness.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.strichpunkt-design.de\/en\/case\/branding-audi-ag\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Strichpunkt project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/audi_rings.png\" alt=\"New Global Identity for Audi by Strichpunkt, BLACKSPACE, and KMS TEAM\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<div class=\"video-container\"><video controls><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/audi_rings.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Rings.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>We <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/audis_typographic_stylings.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">last talked about Audi in 2009<\/a> when they introduced their new custom type family designed by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.boldmonday.com\/custom\/audi\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bold Monday<\/a> and when they gave their rings a polish. That was also the time when Audi dropped its distinctive wordmark. With this latest iteration they drop the wordmark altogether and let the rings become the logo. In the process they have de-polished them and gone flat. If this version of the logo were introduced today as a new logo it would probably get demolished but, naturally, because it has the equity of years of use and the association with some of the finest (affordable-ish) cars on the road the simplicity of these rings is well supported. It&#8217;s also the most natural evolution for a luxury brand, moving into a confident, flat design.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/audi_ring_ratios.png\" alt=\"New Global Identity for Audi by Strichpunkt, BLACKSPACE, and KMS TEAM\" \/>\n<figcaption>Ring ratios when paired with typography.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/audi_rings_examples.jpg\" alt=\"New Global Identity for Audi by Strichpunkt, BLACKSPACE, and KMS TEAM\" \/>\n<figcaption>Examples of the rings in use.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/audi_type.png\" alt=\"New Global Identity for Audi by Strichpunkt, BLACKSPACE, and KMS TEAM\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<div class=\"video-container\"><video controls><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/audi_type.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Audi Type, custom designed by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.boldmonday.com\/custom\/audi\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bold Monday<\/a> between 2008 &#8211; 09.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The type family has expanded to include a couple of variations designed to perform on digital devices and this is still one of my favorite corporate type families around.
