(The <a href=\"http:\/\/corp.asics.com\/en\/press\/article\/2016-09-15-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">press release<\/a> mentions it was RE-launched but I couldn&#8217;t exactly figure out when before the ASICS Tiger brand existed as a combined product and I&#8217;m not up to snuff on sneaker history.) ASICS Tiger builds on the legacy of the two names, dating back to the 1950s and 60s, but with a contemporary spin and technology. To coincide with the opening of the first ASICS Tiger store, located in Osaka, Japan, the brand introduced a new logo designed by New York, NY-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.alanpeckolick.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Alan Peckolick<\/a> &#8212; who, along with Herb Lubalin, designed the original ASICS logo &#8212; and identity designed by Toronto, Canada-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.brucemaudesign.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bruce Mau Design<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>Complementing the original 1977 logo used when ASICS was founded, the new brand logo adds the word &#8220;TiGER&#8221; in similar typography. The new logo expresses the universal dynamism of our sports brand and the strengths that color active lifestyles. The design was developed together with famed graphic designer Alan Peckolick.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/corp.asics.com\/en\/press\/article\/2016-09-15-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ASICS press release<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/asics_tiger_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for ASICS Tiger by Alan Peckolick and Bruce Mau Design\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/asics_tiger_logo_horizontal.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for ASICS Tiger by Alan Peckolick and Bruce Mau Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo, stacked and horizontal.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo combined the original ASICS logo with Tiger typeset in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.myfonts.com\/fonts\/itc\/kabel\/ult\/?refby=ucllc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kabel<\/a> &#8212; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.transit.dot.gov\/sites\/fta.dot.gov\/files\/pictures\/TIGER.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">what is it with the word Tiger and Kabel?!<\/a> &#8212; and the famed stripes motif disproportionately large above the name. It was a mishmash of three things that didn&#8217;t belong together in a lock-up. Building on the retro aesthetic of the original logo makes perfect sense both in terms of mining the legacy of the brand and of building on the trend of reviving phototypesetting-era typography. The horizontal version of the logo works best in creating a unified wordmark, whereas in the stacked version there is a weird sense of Tiger being bigger. Nonetheless, what makes either version work is the funkiness of the individual characters and the tight spacing between them &#8212; those &#8220;Si&#8221; and &#8220;Ti&#8221; pairings are killer.<\/p>\n<blockquote>Expanding from ASICS&#8217; seminal logo, this new brand identity acts as a link between the label&#8217;s heritage and contemporary culture. The brand system is inspired by overlapping wild postings on the streets and applied through the use of bold brand photography layered over large-scale type. BMD worked with Kontrapunkt to develop a new typeface that merges the geometry of the ASICS logo with updated typographical components.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.brucemaudesign.com\/work?project_id=140\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bruce Mau Design project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/asics_tiger_typeface.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for ASICS Tiger by Alan Peckolick and Bruce Mau Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Custom font designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kontrapunkt.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kontrapunkt<\/a>.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The identity revolves around a custom font designed by Copenhagen-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kontrapunkt.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kontrapunkt<\/a> that expands on the language of the ASICS wordmark with a full set of funky characters that mix condensed structures with full circles for the &#8220;O&#8221; and &#8220;Q&#8221;.

Overall, this is a great case of style over substance, where I don&#8217;t mean to belittle any strategic or conceptual work, but it&#8217;s nice to see some vintage design on steroids and appreciate that it looks awesome just for the sake of being awesome (and selling shoes).<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Launched in 2015 ASICS Tiger is a sports and lifestyle shoe and apparel brand from parent company ASICS Corporation, that also manages the sister consumer brands of ASICS and Onitsuka Tiger.
