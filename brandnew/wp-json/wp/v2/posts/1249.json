Its corporation, Bharti Airtel, also provides land line services and broadband internet access. Last week, with the news that it would launch a complete 3G network, Airtel introduced a new identity designed by the London office of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thebrandunion.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Brand Union<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>Our unique symbol is an interpretation of the &#8216;a&#8217; in Airtel. The curved shape and the gentle highlights on the red color make it warm and inviting, almost as if it were a living object. it represents a dynamic force of unparalleled energy that brings us and our customers closer. Our specially designed logo type is modern, vibrant and friendly. It signals our resolve to be accessible, while the use of all lowercase is our recognition for the need for humility. Red is part of our heritage. It is the color of energy and passion that expresses the dynamism that has made Airtel the success it is today, in india, and now on the global stage.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.airtel.in\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Airtel&#8217;s website<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/airtel_photo.jpg\" alt=\"Airtel \"><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Bharti Airtel Chairman and Managing Director Sunil Bharti Mittal (left) and India and South Asia CEO Sanjay Kapoor launch the new logo and signature tune at a press conference.

Rahman, winner of the 2009 Oscar for Best Original Song, <em>Slumdog Millionaire<\/em>&#8216;s &#8220;Jai Ho.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The old logo, from what I have gathered reading the news items, had a lot of equity and given the amount of subscribers it was probably found everywhere so I can imagine this being a fairly monumental change in India, where the core of Airtel&#8217;s customers are. Obviously, there is nothing remarkable about the old logo and it was fairly generic. The new retains some of that generic aesthetic, except with its modern counterpart of lowercase typography set in some weird hybrid of Dax and Meta &mdash; in other words, it&#8217;s awkward. The icon borders on interesting, but it doesn&#8217;t quite fulfill. The quote above implies it&#8217;s an &#8220;a&#8221; or perhaps it&#8217;s an &#8220;A.&#8221; Either way, I don&#8217;t really see it. As far as swooshes go, it&#8217;s very swooshy and engorged &mdash; in other words, it&#8217;s awkward. There is also the unnecessary, webby higlights added to the version of their website (why?!). The animation at the end of the commercial above shows a little more promise in how it comes to life and adds dynamism. Overall, it&#8217;s a step into the twenty-first century, but it&#8217;s like it&#8217;s dancing with two left feet.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sidv.co\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Siddharth Vanchinathan<\/a> for first tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_101122_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_101122_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_101122_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_101122_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,26,89],"tags":[385,105,386,309,42,356],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1249"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1249"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1249\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1249"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1249"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1249"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
