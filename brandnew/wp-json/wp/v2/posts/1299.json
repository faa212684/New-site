The focus of the April issue of <em>Creative Review<\/em> will be &#8220;Dedicated to the art of logo design&#8221; and they have taken on the subjective challenge of making a definitive list of the Best 20 Logos Ever. They will ask for &#8220;the expert opinion of designers, academics and critics who will ultimately help us come up with 20 of the world&#8217;s greatest logo designs&#8221; but first, they need everyone&#8217;s opinion. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.creativereview.co.uk\/cr-blog\/2011\/january\/logo-design-readers-vote\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">They have already asked their early-rising European readers<\/a> to nominate their Top 5 logo designs of all time.
