Their properties and overall positioning are on the luxury, high end. This past April, at its annual meeting, Halstead introduced a new identity designed by New York, NY-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pentagram.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pentagram<\/a> partner Eddie Opara.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>Strong, smart, robust and pragmatic, the identity&#8217;s visual language is built of a layered system of elements that can adapt and evolve for various applications and brand expressions. Like Halstead&#8217;s agents, the firm&#8217;s new logo is multidimensional and flexible. The reimagined &#8220;H&#8221; icon is architectural and spatial, offering the ability to stand alone as well as the flexibility for rotation, use in endlessly expanding patterns, and as a window for photography, or even as a directional arrow.<br \/><br \/>The logotype is set in Domaine Sans, a sleek, refined sans serif (designed by Klim Type) that is simultaneously historical and contemporary, bridging the past and future. The company name has been changed to simply &#8220;Halstead,&#8221; which can be accompanied by &#8220;Real Estate&#8221; to provide context when needed.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.pentagram.com\/work\/halstead\/story\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pentagram project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/halstead_icon_before_after.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Halstead by Pentagram\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icon before and after.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/halstead_wordmark.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Halstead by Pentagram\" \/>\n<figcaption>Wordmark.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/halstead_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Halstead by Pentagram\" \/>\n<figcaption>Lock-up.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/halstead_icon_rotation.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Halstead by Pentagram\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icon rotation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The vibrant and systematic approach to color sets the brand apart and evokes the dazzling diversity of New York and its neighborhoods. The corporate color set consists of an elegant palette of grays that anchors the brand, while three additional color sets reflect the company&#8217;s various markets throughout the tri-state region&#8211;Manhattan, the outer boroughs and the suburban areas. Each market has its own distinct character and qualities, and the different color sets allow these characteristics to shine while maintaining a strong connection to the core Halstead brand.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.pentagram.com\/work\/halstead\/story\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pentagram project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/halstead_icon_rotation_with_color.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Halstead by Pentagram\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/265817777?autoplay=1&#038;loop=1&#038;color=f0001c&#038;title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Color variations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Living in New York it&#8217;s almost impossible to <em>not<\/em> see Halstead&#8217;s logo throughout the city, regardless of whether you are looking for a place to buy\/rent or not; it&#8217;s just always there, somewhere. And that quaint &#8220;H&#8221; with windows and that bland green have always irked me, especially when you see the prices of some of the properties they manage, having a huge discrepancy in how low-end their old logo looked. The new logo is surprisingly daring and perhaps not Avant-garde in the larger context of the world but surely yes in the New York real estate world. The new &#8220;H&#8221; icon stands out dramatically from its main competition, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.corcoran.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Corcoran<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.elliman.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Douglas Elliman<\/a>, among others.<\/p>\n<p>The harsh angles and relatively more in-your-face aesthetic of the icon are tempered with the use of a high-contrast sans, <a href=\"https:\/\/klim.co.nz\/retail-fonts\/domaine-sans-text\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Domaine Sans<\/a> from Klim Type, that adds a touch of Upper West Side glamour while managing to feel youthful and contemporary. It&#8217;s an odd combination of icon and wordmark but the two elements work interestingly in the applications.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/halstead_pattern.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Halstead by Pentagram\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/265817783?autoplay=1&#038;loop=1&#038;color=f0001c&#038;title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Pattern.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/halstead_stationery_small.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Halstead by Pentagram\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stationery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/halstead_stationery.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Halstead by Pentagram\" \/>\n<figcaption>Folder and envelope.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>To develop the new tagline, we looked inward.
