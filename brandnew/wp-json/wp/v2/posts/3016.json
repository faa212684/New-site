Commonly known as the Grand Prix of Endurance and Efficiency, race teams have to balance speed against the cars&#8217; ability to run for 24 hours without sustaining mechanical damage to the car and manage the cars&#8217; consumables, primarily fuel, tires and braking materials. The endurance of the drivers is likewise tested as drivers frequently spend stints of over two hours behind the wheel before stopping in the pits and allowing a relief driver to take over the driving duties. Drivers then grab what food and rest they can before returning to drive another stint. Current race regulations mandate that three drivers share each competing vehicle. The race is organised by the Automobile Club de l&#8217;Ouest (ACO) and runs on the Circuit de la Sarthe.
