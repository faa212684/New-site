Its identity, designed by local firm <a href=\"https:\/\/www.radicalco-op.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Radical Co-operative<\/a> is a throwback to 1950s style diners but it has a really groovy contemporary flair and an overall happy, pleasing, welcoming vibe with the combination of a slick script &#8220;Prime&#8221; and &#8220;PIZZA&#8221; served in individual pies. The signage, from the neon exterior sign to the hand-painted type on the windows to the menu board, is super nice. Prime indeed. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.radicalco-op.com\/work\/prime-pizza\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Totem Run 2017 by Jim Wong<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_totemrun.jpg\" alt=\"Totem Run 2017 by Jim Wong\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/totemrun.runourcity.org\/en\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Totem Run 2017<\/a> was the 4th annual charity trail run organized by RunOurCity in Hong Kong. The event is named after a totem composed of a leopard, a lion, and a monkey, which were brought to life with epic enthusiasm by local designer <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gd-morning.org\/jim\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jim Wong<\/a>. This isn&#8217;t a typical Friday Likes and it&#8217;s hard to get excited about graphics for a running race but there is something contagiously effusive about this as the patterns and illustrations go balls to the wall on every possible surface, from the inflatable start and finish signs to the killer sleeves. All the runners look so happy and the graphics around their smiles merrily accentuate their feels. I would run the 57 kilometers (or perhaps the 16 km version) for the swag alone. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.gd-morning.org\/jim\/totem-run-2017\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Angela Georgiou by Clout<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_angelageorgiu.jpg\" alt=\"Angela Georgiou by Clout\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.angelageorgiou.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Angela Georgiou<\/a> is a UK-based jewelry designer creating bespoke luxury pieces for clients.
