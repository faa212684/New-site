Hershey in Pennsylvania, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thehersheycompany.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Hershey Company<\/a> is a global confectionery producer with more than 80 individual brands around the world. These span from the eponymous Hershey&#8217;s to Reese&#8217;s to Kisses to Jolly Ranchers to Twizzlers and more. Over 13,000 employees across the globe help The Hershey Company achieve their promise, of &#8220;Bringing Goodness to the World&#8221;. Now, the parent company is getting a little bit of that goodness of its own with a redesigned logo and supporting identity designed by Hershey Global Design &mdash; led by Ron Burrage, Sr. Director Global Head of Design &mdash; and Cincinnati, OH-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.godutchstudio.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">goDutch<\/a> with a custom font by New York, NY-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.alexanderdesign.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Alexander Design Associates<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>Our guiding principle during the design and development process was to stay true to the rich Hershey legacy, while at the same time, signaling the company&#8217;s evolution from a predominately U.S. chocolate maker to a global confection and snack company.<br \/><br \/>Central to the visual identity system is the new logo &#8211; built upon the globally recognized HERSHEY logotype used on its famous Hershey&#8217;s chocolate bar and a fresh and modern interpretation of the beloved KISSES icon.<\/blockquote><h3>Provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hershey_company_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for The Hershey Company done In-house with goDutch\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo featured the typography straight from the flagshipp Hershey&#8217;s bar, apostrophe and all, along with a literal rendering of another popular product, a Kiss. I&#8217;ve never really thought about The Hershey Company as having a logo, it just seemed like a still life of their products that never quite felt official. The new logo is now more clearly a corporate mark, formally integrated and more easily recognizable and reproducible. What&#8217;s great is that it&#8217;s basically the same elements as before but with more intention. The new wordmark showcases the chocolate bar typography sans the beveling &mdash; I particularly enjoy the detail of the &#8220;R&#8221; cradling the &#8220;S&#8221; &mdash; and a flat Kiss that&#8217;s as recognizable in a single color as it is as a full-color photograph. Repeating &#8220;The Hershey Company&#8221; under &#8220;Hershey&#8221; still seems odd, but I guess it is what it is.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hershey_company_font.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for The Hershey Company done In-house with goDutch\" \/>\n<figcaption>New &#8220;Milton&#8221; typeface by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.alexanderdesign.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Alexander Design Associates<\/a>.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The custom font looks solid and sturdy, with each letter tight and condensed like a single brick of the chocolate bar. A couple of letters have some nice character to them, like the &#8220;J&#8221; and &#8220;Q&#8221;.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hershey_company_icon.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for The Hershey Company done In-house with goDutch\" \/>\n<figcaption>Kiss Icon detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>I guess you could argue that if the Kiss is brown it&#8217;s been stripped off its foil wrapper, yet the paper ribbon still remains &mdash; which would break the Kisses law of physics. But it does make for a quick read. So, yeah, it&#8217;s something we can argue about.<\/p>\n<blockquote>The new logo is complimented by a new, disciplined visual identity system that is inspired by the famous colors of its most iconic brands, including Hershey&#8217;s, Reese&#8217;s and Ice Breakers, to bring a consistent look to all of the company&#8217;s visual materials.<\/blockquote><h3>Provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hershey_company_icon_branded.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for The Hershey Company done In-house with goDutch\" \/>\n<figcaption>Branded icon.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hershey_company_business_cards.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for The Hershey Company done In-house with goDutch\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hershey_company_collateral.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for The Hershey Company done In-house with goDutch\" \/>\n<figcaption>Collateral.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/104574447?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=c60c30\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Brand grid, animated.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">Not much to see in application. There are some patterns that you can see in the business cards and video above that are taken from the products; you can discern the Kisses one while the red is for Twizzlers, orange for Reese&#8217;s, and blue one for Ice Breakers. Despite having the new custom font, it doesn&#8217;t seem to appear in application yet, opting instead for the popular <a href=\"https:\/\/www.myfonts.com\/fonts\/hvdfonts\/brandon-grotesque\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brandon Grotesque<\/a> to carry the weight. Overall, this is a really nice update that gives The Hershey Company its own voice that, although it remains tied to its brand products, gives it independence to communicate in a cohesive visual language.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1909 by Milton S.
