The logo has both its good moments and bad moments. The &#8220;C&#8221; icon is smart and nicely executed with a modest flexible system to it &mdash; particularly good is the iteration directly below with the open book. The typography leaves a lot to be desired but it&#8217;s not completely reproachable. It does its job of communicating to a mass market that the notebooks are both personable and serious.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/my_companion_bag.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for My Companion by NH1 Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Tote.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mycompanion_books_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for My Companion by NH1 Design\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mycompanion_books_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for My Companion by NH1 Design\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mycompanion_books_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for My Companion by NH1 Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Range of notebooks.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mycompanion_books_comparison_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for My Companion by NH1 Design\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mycompanion_books_comparison.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for My Companion by NH1 Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Comparison with other notebook brands.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">The system for the notebooks has a very polished look that stands out as more professional than the explosion of colors from other notebook brands. It&#8217;s disarmingly simple in just having a thick white border all around with a giant image covering the rest. Better typography &mdash; IMHO unicase FTL (For the Loss) &mdash; could have elevated the identity up a few notches but, again, the result does its job more than adequately.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Launched earlier this year, My Companion &mdash; produced by Brijlaxmi Paper Products which in turn is owned by conglomerate Shrachi Group &mdash; is a new range of notebooks in India for its more than 100 million students from elementary schools&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[51,12,26],"tags":[386,54,979],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2903"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2903"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2903\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2903"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2903"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2903"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
