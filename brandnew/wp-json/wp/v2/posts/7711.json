The identity for Saint Kate has been designed by Chicago, IL-based <a href=\"https:\/\/onedesigncompany.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">One Design Company<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>The Saint Kate brand hinges on programming&#8211;from visual artwork to performance. It&#8217;s a living, breathing, evolving space. Far from an ordinary hotel with a static white box gallery, Saint Kate celebrates the process of creative exploration and craft. Guests&#8211;from travelers to event-goers to local makers&#8211;are encouraged to participate in the thrilling, often messy, and always unexpected process of exploration and creation. Rotating shows, programming partnerships, a formal artist-in-residence program, pop-up performances, and regular classes and workshops bring this promise to life.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/onedesigncompany.com\/news\/featured-project-saint-kate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">One Design Company project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/saint_kate_arts_hotel_logo_and_stuff.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Saint Kate Arts Hotel by One Design Company\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo with other logo-esque things.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The oval of the mark&#8211;a formal nod to printer seals, crests, and vignettes of the past&#8211; represents a frame or a lens: a window leading to a new perspective; a portal to an unexpected experience.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/onedesigncompany.com\/news\/featured-project-saint-kate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">One Design Company project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/saint_kate_arts_hotel_logo_animation.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo with photos.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>While the logo follows a certain trend &#8212; somewhere between deadpan fashion and too-hip-to-care fashion &#8212; with an aloof uppercase sans serif, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.grillitype.com\/typeface\/gt-america\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GT America Extended<\/a> in this case, the composition inside a vertical oval is a relatively surprising twist, in the sense that it&#8217;s not a square composition designed to fit into social media avatars by default, that makes it different and a little more engaging. The name, Saint Kate, being so widely separated vertically, creates good tension in the logo and the designation as &#8220;The Arts Hotel&#8221; stands out quite well within that space. It seems elementary but deserves praise as it&#8217;s a common occurrence to the contrary: I like how the stroke of the oval matches the thickness of the typography. The additional logo things are all okay, if a little too precious &#8212; the &#8220;SKT&#8221; monogram is interesting, looking almost like a stained glass composition, but the other encased things are maybe a little gratuitous. Still, a flexible suite of stuff that does get put to use throughout the identity. The all-red approach is cool, perhaps a little on the aggressive side, but the airiness of the identity softens it.<\/p>\n<blockquote>The Saint Kate identity balances two functions simultaneously: it&#8217;s a supportive visual framework for artistic expression, as well as a vibrant and memorable voice for the hotel itself. The typography-driven design language is the foundation for a system that can be dialed up or down as needed for appropriate and exciting solutions in any given situation.<br \/><br \/>Saint Kate&#8217;s visual language is a study in flexibility and contrast, breathing life into a wide range of touchpoints from the guest rooms to the public space: environmental signage, collateral, gallery guides, a regular publication, hotel amenities, the website, and more are all united through a consistent thread of design expression.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/onedesigncompany.com\/news\/featured-project-saint-kate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">One Design Company project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/saint_kate_arts_hotel_business_cards.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Saint Kate Arts Hotel by One Design Company\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/saint_kate_arts_hotel_stationery.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Saint Kate Arts Hotel by One Design Company\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stationery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/saint_kate_arts_hotel_launch_invitation.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Saint Kate Arts Hotel by One Design Company\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/saint_kate_arts_hotel_poster.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Saint Kate Arts Hotel by One Design Company\" \/>\n<figcaption>Launch invitation and poster.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/saint_kate_arts_hotel_launch_event_tshirts.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Saint Kate Arts Hotel by One Design Company\" \/>\n<figcaption>Launch event t-shirts.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/saint_kate_arts_hotel_lapel_pin.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Saint Kate Arts Hotel by One Design Company\" \/>\n<figcaption>Lapel pun.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/saint_kate_arts_hotel_events_guide.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Saint Kate Arts Hotel by One Design Company\" \/>\n<figcaption>Event guide.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/saint_kate_arts_hotel_artwork_guide.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Saint Kate Arts Hotel by One Design Company\" \/>\n<figcaption>Artwork guide.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/saint_kate_arts_hotel_posters.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Saint Kate Arts Hotel by One Design Company\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/saint_kate_arts_hotel_posters_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Saint Kate Arts Hotel by One Design Company\" \/>\n<figcaption>Posters.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>In application, the identity throws Sharp Type&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/sharptype.co\/typefaces\/ogg\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ogg<\/a> into the mix, which adds a quirky, artsy ingredient that, in its lightness, pairs very well with GT America. The subtle use of the oval as a window is very nicely handled (as seen in the posters one image up) by creating a recurring motif but without being too overbearing. The overall vibe of the compositions is a little Hipster\/Brutalist but stops a few degrees short of being too much.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/saint_kate_arts_hotel_keycards.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Saint Kate Arts Hotel by One Design Company\" \/>\n<figcaption>Keycards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/saint_kate_arts_hotel_door_hangers.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Saint Kate Arts Hotel by One Design Company\" \/>\n<figcaption>Do not disturb signs.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/saint_kate_arts_hotel_cups.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Saint Kate Arts Hotel by One Design Company\" \/>\n<figcaption>Cups.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/saint_kate_arts_hotel_shampoo.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Saint Kate Arts Hotel by One Design Company\" \/>\n<figcaption>Toiletries.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/saint_kate_arts_hotel_tote.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Saint Kate Arts Hotel by One Design Company\" \/>\n<figcaption>Tote.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The hotel accoutrements are all quite nice as well and I like how they mix photography in relatively unexpected places like the keycards and coffee cups. Speaking of the latte-r (haha, get it?) I also enjoy the secondary use of the ovals, where many can be stacked at different angles &#8212; it creates a bold and fun alternate but still related aesthetic that&#8217;s very interesting. And the tiny shampoo bottles are killing it.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/saint_kate_arts_hotel_exterior_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Saint Kate Arts Hotel by One Design Company\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/saint_kate_arts_hotel_exterior_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Saint Kate Arts Hotel by One Design Company\" \/>\n<figcaption>Exterior sign.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">As cool as the sign is, it&#8217;s the one thing that somehow feels off, with the heavy division down the middle of the word, which is not something that happens in the applications. Still, as a beacon for the hotel, it&#8217;s hot. Overall, the identity fits very well with the arts mission of the hotel and the language used to present it &#8212; at times causing a bit of eye-rolling to be honest (e.g. &#8220;Saint Kate is more than a hotel. This is a venue&#8211;a platform for exploration, connection and expression.&#8221;&#8230; it&#8217;s a hotel, folks) &#8212; and it certainly commits to a specific personality and delivers on it across the board.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Opened this month (June 2019 for future readers), Saint Kate is a new arts hotel in downtown Milwaukee, WI.
