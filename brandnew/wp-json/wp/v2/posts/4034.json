The identity part of the project was designed by Berlin-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.malw.in\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Malwin B&eacute;la H&uuml;rkey<\/a> and it mimics an Asian wax seal design with a beautiful typographic execution that certainly makes you do a double take and realize that it&#8217;s set in Latin. The logo is very well done and has just the right amount of digital fuzz to convey the texture of a seal. The packaging part was designed by Stockholm, Sweden-based <a href=\"http:\/\/engelmannlennart.de\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lennart Engelmann<\/a> and features some lovely cylindrical boxes (that I do have to wonder how the food goes in) with a very pretty red thread to close them and comes with a clever icon system to indicate the contents (see the project link). Overall, just very pretty and airy and sophisticated. Hard to tell if it&#8217;s for reals but if you are going to do a faux project it better look as good as this one does. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/25654789\/Studio-Majoran\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Jamie&#8217;s Italian Deli Range by The Plant<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_jamiesitalian.jpg\" alt=\"TJamie's Italian Deli Range by The Plant\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">To add a range of deli products to Jamie Oliver&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jamieoliver.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jamie&#8217;s Italian<\/a> restaurants, London-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theplant.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Plant<\/a> went the full Italian with a bevy of packaging mannerisms from the country while adding a few contemporary touches. For the record: I don&#8217;t care one bit about the restaurant&#8217;s logo, which I assume existed before this project and was handed to The Plant for inclusion. A lot of this stuff we&#8217;ve seen (either in Italy, pictures of Italy, or more extravagantly done by Louise Fili) but the pared down approach works quite well across the line of products. The pasta bags are nice as are the tomato sauces and especially the balsamic vinegar tins (even with their scaled typography). Not entirely <em>molto bene<\/em> but <em>bene<\/em> enough.  <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theplant.co.uk\/projects\/detail\/jamies-italian-deli-range\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Fetcham Park by Kevin Cantrell and Hint Creative<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_fetchampark.jpg\" alt=\"Parc Olympique by lg2boutique\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/fetchampark.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fetcham Park<\/a> is a wedding and event venue housed in a 1705 mansion with more glitz than you can make a toast at. The venue&#8217;s identity designed by Murray, UT-based <a href=\"http:\/\/kevincantrell.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kevin Cantrell<\/a> and Salt Lake City, UT-based <a href=\"http:\/\/hintcreative.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hint Creative<\/a> brings a vintage aura with a crisp contemporary feel. Designed with Kevin&#8217;s unmistakeable attention to detail, the identity is rich in variety and ornament and you know that everything will look even more stunning when foil stamped in gold on that sweet color palette. When I grow up I want to have Kevin&#8217;s vector patience and perseverance. <strong><a href=\"http:\/\/kevincantrell.com\/portfolio\/fetcham-park-identity\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/strong><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"From the bare minimum to the lush maximum we have what you crave this week with work from Berlin and Stockholm, London, and Utah&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[729,564,1166],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4034"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4034"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4034\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4034"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4034"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4034"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
