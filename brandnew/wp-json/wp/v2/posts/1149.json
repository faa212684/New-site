In 2006, Post Danmark and CVC Capital Partners acquired a minority ownership (at 49<em>.9<\/em>%) from the state, and beginning in January 2011, the post service will become a private company and be released from control by the state. Last month a new name, the all lowercase <a href=\"http:\/\/www.post.be\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bpost<\/a>, and identity, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.interbrand.com\/case_study.aspx?caseid=1226&#038;langid=1000\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">designed by Interbrand<\/a>, were introduced.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bpost_formula.gif\" alt=\"bpost\" \/><\/p>\n<blockquote>&#8220;The new name conveys our two basic characteristics,&#8221; explains Johnny Thijs. &#8220;We are and will remain a postal company, and we have and will maintain strong roots in our home market.

The international players work on expressions of speed, coverage and efficiency. The next step for the sector is to move beyond motion to emotion&#8211;focusing on relationship building and getting closer to understanding businesses and their needs by leveraging the latest technology available.&#8221;<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.interbrand.com\/press_release.aspx?pressid=324&#038;langid=1000\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Interbrand Press Release<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p>I understand why logos go for lowercase appeal, but an organization like a post service adopting its official name in lowercase seems awfully useless and unprofessional, even something more trendy like bPost would help it stand out in written communications. The new logo is also rather odd, now an abstraction of the previous abstraction of a horn &mdash; an abstraction that is well known and often used. As a tilted, half-target the new logo is devoid of much meaning although the one positive thing I can say about it is that, if you squint, it still looks like the old logo, so it does retain some of the visual equity. The bpost typography is a tad dull. In application, like the livery (and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.deredactie.be\/cm\/vrtnieuws\/mediatheek\/redactietips\/redactietips_2eNiveau\/1.803707\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here is a video<\/a> where you can see a pretty bike), the blown-up logo starts to look interesting and create a recognizable look.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bpost_livery_01.jpg\" alt=\"bpost\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bpost_livery_02.jpg\" alt=\"bpost\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Source for livery images: Interbrand.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/xavierbertels.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Xavier Bertels<\/a> for first tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_100715_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_100715_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_100715_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_100715_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_100715_config_03.xml&#038;xyz=poll_100715_votes_03.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv3\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv3\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,76,26],"tags":[253,254,105,255],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1149"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1149"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1149\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1149"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1149"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1149"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
