After a rough patch towards the end of the first decade of the 2000s, Motorola was split into two independent companies: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.motorolasolutions.com\/US-EN\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Motorola Solutions<\/a>, which &#8220;provides mission-critical communications products and services to enterprises and governments&#8221; and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.motorola.com\/Consumers\/US-EN\/Home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Motorola Mobility<\/a>, which &#8220;delivers personalized information to meet the needs of consumers both in the home and on the go.&#8221; The latter keeping the smartphone side of the business. In 2012 Google <a href=\"http:\/\/www.google.com\/press\/motorola\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">acquired<\/a> Motorola Mobility setting up a beneficial synergy between Google&#8217;s Android OS and Motorola&#8217;s hardware. This week, a new tiny logo for Motorola was spotted on the footer of <a href=\"http:\/\/techweek.com\/chicago\/events\/techweek-100\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Techweek100<\/a>&#8216;s site, a conference presented by Motorola. Later, not sure how, another version of the logo, confirmed by Motorola, appeared. No announcement, official reveal, or design credit.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/motorola_google_logo_detail_01.gif\" alt=\"Motorola Logo\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Monogram in solid circle.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/motorola_google_logo_detail_02.gif\" alt=\"Motorola Logo\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Monogram in a dashed-border circle.<\/p>\n<p>The intention of the change is obvious: Google is marking its territory in a way just a touch more subtle than a cat peeing on its backyard. The change most people will notice is barely design related, it&#8217;s in the nomenclature of it, &#8220;Motorola: A Google Company&#8221;. I can&#8217;t think of many (or any) consumer products or services being so heavily-handed &#8220;branded&#8221; (in the original sense of the word) as Google is doing here. Perhaps it&#8217;s a maneuver that will last only a few years until people know that Motorola is Google&#8217;s bitch because, sorry, but that&#8217;s what this sounds like.<\/p>\n<p>Graphically, the famous Motorola &#8220;M&#8221; remains the same and seems like it will still be used in a solid circle as usual. The biggest surprise is the multi-colored ring version that has popped all over the internet. It&#8217;s an interesting extension that definitely signals something is different but not completely different. It works in providing a fresh take on the monogram and seeing it, literally, through a new frame. Although Google didn&#8217;t have any problem putting its name on the logo, it held back in making the colored ring be Google&#8217;s official colors because I guess that would be too much. The typography went from a bold, italic uppercase to a light, normal lowercase setting. It seems like it&#8217;s been two or three years since we last saw this kind of friendly-fication of a logo. It does kind of work, especially in unison with the &#8220;a&#8221; and &#8220;company&#8221; being lowercase too. It does have a nice rhythm to it with all those &#8220;o&#8221;s and the customized &#8220;a&#8221; at the end is (although annoying) enough to give the wordmark some customization without going overboard. Overall, this is clearly a logo to signal change and to establish who&#8217;s boss in this, so a definite success.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to Boudewijn Vermolen for first tip.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_130627_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_130627_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"285\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_130627_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_130627_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"285\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_130627_config_03.xml&#038;xyz=poll_130627_votes_03.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"285\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv3\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv3\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,36,26],"tags":[617,141,148,40],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2546"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2546"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2546\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2546"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2546"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2546"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
