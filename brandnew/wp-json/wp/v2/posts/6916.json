For their presence at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eatalyworld.it\/en\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FICO Eataly World<\/a>, a &#8220;food theme park&#8221; in Bologna, Mutti prepared a limited edition range of some of their products. Designed by Firenze-based <a href=\"http:\/\/auge-design.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Auge Design<\/a>, the  packaging includes a series of the best canned tomatoes you will ever see, with abstracted tomatoes in the background layered with beautiful gold typography and graphics &#8212; it&#8217;s kind of amazing that they are basically the same elements found on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=Mutti&#038;safe=active&#038;source=lnms&#038;tbm=isch&#038;sa=X&#038;ved=0ahUKEwi9tZL_sd3dAhWD7YMKHRQmBHgQ_AUIEygA&#038;biw=1274&#038;bih=859\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the everyday Mutti packaging<\/a>.

The identity, designed by Melbourne-based <a href=\"https:\/\/afom.com.au\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A Friend of Mine<\/a>, features a vertical, monospace logo in a funky bold sans serif that is probably not much to look at as a flat graphic but it has been amazingly translated into a  chrome-plated, 3D-printed lettering that sits on the window of the small restaurant. While that would be enough, the logo is also made into fuzzy letters for the staff. I want both things, badly. A secondary element is a bitmap pattern that I&#8217;m not sure what its concept is but that nonetheless looks great on the window, as the chopstick sleeves, and as tissue paper to serve some of the food. Can you spot the &#8220;FUTURE&#8221; woven into the pattern? <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/afom.com.au\/projects\/future-future\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Dear Mayuko by Daikoku Design Institute<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_mayuko.jpg\" alt=\"Dear Mayuko by Daikoku Design Institute\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/dearmayuko.co.jp\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dear Mayuko<\/a> is a cosmetics and beauty brand with five retail stores in Japan.

Wether used as a single element, rearranged to form faces, used as a window to place other patterns, or as pattern themselves, the wobbly ovals create a unified, soft look across multiple categories of products. If the soft color palette and delicate typography are any indication, I&#8217;m switching to these products and away from my Tide-based beauty treatments. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/daikoku.ndc.co.jp\/work\/dearmayuko\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"An elegant and richly produced range of projects this week, with work from Firenze, Melbourne, and Los Angeles&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[51,11,85,26],"tags":[729,53,564],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6916"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=6916"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6916\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=6916"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=6916"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=6916"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
