The new, revitalized logo has been executed by Uruguay-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kabala.com.uy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kabala<\/a>, who had previously done packaging for Bimbo and are now heading the design of the packaging. The brief was as simple as it gets: Make the logo fresh and relevant, stick with the same elements. With the complicated discussions around vaguely disclosed strategies we read on press releases, it is rather nice to just be able to look at a no nonsense graphic execution. The old logo was charming and the typography most likely the result of an original sign painting outside of the first store &mdash; I&#8217;m just romanticizing here, I don&#8217;t know the story of the logo &mdash; while the new one fits perfectly in today&#8217;s world of consumer good packaging and icons. The typography &mdash; set in Myriad Pro Black Italic (I never would have guessed) &mdash; is clean and friendly, and pretty much the same can be said about the baker. The elements are well integrated and the colors more in tune with the flagship brand of Bimbo. A very hearty update for this purveyor of (what I&#8217;m sure are) delicious treats.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/el_maestro_cubano_colors.gif\" alt=\"El Maestro Cubano Colors\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/el_maestro_cubano_evolution.gif\" alt=\"El Maestro Cubano Icon Evolution\" \/><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,51,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/637"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=637"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/637\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=637"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=637"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=637"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
