The idea was to align the brand identity with the food offering, making La Cage a more modern brasserie sportive with a clean design that will appeal to a greater number of fans.&#8221;<\/blockquote><h3>lg2boutique provided press release<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/la_cage_brasserie_sportive_logo_detail_alt.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for La Cage Brasserie Sportive by lg2boutique\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo was very unrefined, with a garish and unwelcoming execution that looked like an unsophisticated sports bar or a really boring version of Dave &amp; Buster&#8217;s. The monogram had been beaten to death with gradients, shadows, highlights, bevels, and chrome effects and the harshly mechanical typography didn&#8217;t do it any favors. The new logo maintains the basic elements of the old one but improves them in every respect. The quadrant-divided icon remains with its &#8220;C&#8221; in the center but with no distracting rendering and the cheap industrial type has been replaced with cool industrial type that maintains a competitive attitude to get sports fans in the mood.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Y6TsGSpfhWY\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Introducing the new look.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/la_cage_brasserie_sportive_logo_alternate.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for La Cage Brasserie Sportive by lg2boutique\" \/>\n<figcaption>Alternate badge\/logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/la_cage_brasserie_sportive_tshirt.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for La Cage Brasserie Sportive by lg2boutique\" \/>\n<figcaption>T-shirt.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/la_cage_brasserie_sportive_badges.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for La Cage Brasserie Sportive by lg2boutique\" \/>\n<figcaption>Communication badges.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The identity gains some additional traction with the extensive use of roundels\/badges to create alternate logos as well as all other kinds of communication thingamajigs announcing everything from half-price wine to chicken wing specials.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/la_cage_brasserie_sportive_coasters.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for La Cage Brasserie Sportive by lg2boutique\" \/>\n<figcaption>Coasters.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/la_cage_brasserie_sportive_beer.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for La Cage Brasserie Sportive by lg2boutique\" \/>\n<figcaption>Pints.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/la_cage_brasserie_sportive_exteriors.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for La Cage Brasserie Sportive by lg2boutique\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sample new exteriors.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">The rest of the identity makes great use of the brand typeface &mdash; anyone identify it? &mdash; as well as the deep blue and red color palette and strong food photography found across their promotions. It&#8217;s not an earth-shattering new identity and we&#8217;ve seen this aesthetic before but anything that makes a sports bar look less like beer-soaked bro-heaven (or bro-hell) and more inviting and appealing for a broader audience is a score for the home team.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1983 with its first location in the Old Montreal section of Montreal, Quebec, La Cage aux Sports is the province&apos;s leading sports bar franchise with 52 locations that attract over 7 million customers each year.
