In its 30 years, the organization has provided a combined $100 million in out-going grants to research initiatives funding exclusively research equipment and infrastructure (as opposed to funding research hours, patient support, or education). Australian Cancer Research Foundation recently purchased the top level domain of .cancerresearch to serve as a hub for news, information and leading opinion on cancer treatment, prevention, diagnosis and cure. Along with this initiative they introduced a new identity designed by Sydney-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.re-blog.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">RE:<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/australian_cancer_research_old.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Australian Cancer Research Foundation by RE:\" \/>\n<figcaption>A sample of the previous look.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The previous logo was unremarkable in being bad or good, it mostly was forgettable except for its crab icon that comes (I am guessing) from the Zodiac sign of cancer, which seems an odd approach. The sampling of old applications are even more unremarkable than the logo itself, relying far too much on the mint color and crab. Although the new materials presented below for the new identity don&#8217;t show it, the crab doesn&#8217;t seem to be fully gone as it still makes appearances on the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.acrf.com.au\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">organization&#8217;s main home page<\/a> and social media accounts.<\/p>\n<blockquote>Cancer Research&#8217;s unmitigated purpose is to end cancer.<br \/><br \/>The new identity highlights the insight that ending cancer will effectively end Cancer Research. Bold statements call out the end of cancer and the organisation in contextually relevant ways.<br \/><br \/>A custom typeface was developed to reflect Cancer Research&#8217;s progress towards its goal. Characters of varying weights represent how some cancers are close to disappearing, while others remain all too visible.<br \/><br \/>By confronting a serious subject matter with a positive and achievable vision, the identity gives people an incredibly compelling reason to donate: That every dollar raised gets us closer to a world without cancer.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/24487009\/Australian-Cancer-Research-Foundation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">RE: project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/australian_cancer_research_logo_variations.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Australian Cancer Research Foundation by RE:\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo variations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The new logo, on its own (as seen on the header image), is not much more attention-grabbing than its predecessor. Of course, the typography is infinitely better and the weight variation from top to bottom starts to signal that there is more to it than just a static long wordmark. It&#8217;s when the letters start to have some variety and the copywriting starts to support the concept that the identity becomes more engaging.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/australian_cancer_research_typeface.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Australian Cancer Research Foundation by RE:\" \/>\n<figcaption>Custom type family, Obsolete Sans by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mathieureguer.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mathieu R&eacute;guer<\/a>.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/australian_cancer_research_typeface_algorithm.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Australian Cancer Research Foundation by RE:\" \/>\n<figcaption>Built-in algorithm to manage weights.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/australian_cancer_research_typeface_cancer_types.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Australian Cancer Research Foundation by RE:\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sample usage.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/australian_cancer_research_breast_animated.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Australian Cancer Research Foundation by RE:\" \/>\n<figcaption>Disappearing cancer.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/australian_cancer_research_skin_animated.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Australian Cancer Research Foundation by RE:\" \/>\n<figcaption>Disappearing cancer.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/australian_cancer_research_cervical_animated.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Australian Cancer Research Foundation by RE:\" \/>\n<figcaption>Disappearing cancer.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/australian_cancer_research_domain.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Australian Cancer Research Foundation by RE:\" \/>\n<figcaption>Putting the top level domain name, .cancerresearch, to use.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The main concept of making cancer disappear comes through in a great way through the animations as one application and the copywriting as another angle.
