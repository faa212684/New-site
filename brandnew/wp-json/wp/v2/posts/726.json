Any downtown in the world could do this treatment, but that the &#8220;T&#8221; is a cross, only helps to underscore that this is Downtown <em>Crossing<\/em>. <\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/downton_crossing_05.jpg\" alt=\"Downtown Crossing Logo, Have We Met Yet?\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/downton_crossing_06.jpg\" alt=\"Downtown Crossing Logo, Have We Met Yet?\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/downton_crossing_07.jpg\" alt=\"Downtown Crossing Logo, Have We Met Yet?\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The rest of the identity has been nicely executed as well and playing off of the idea of &#8220;Boston&#8217;s Meeting Place&#8221; they have done some nice, playful work using the &#8220;meet&#8221; badge as a way to introduce the diversity of the neighborhood.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/downton_crossing_01.jpg\" alt=\"Downtown Crossing Logo, Have We Met Yet?\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/downton_crossing_02.jpg\" alt=\"Downtown Crossing Logo, Have We Met Yet?\" \/><\/p>\n<p>And then there is the wrap around Filene&#8217;s Basement, titled &#8220;Have we met yet?&#8221;, where on July of this year, through a three-day photoshoot rendered 668 portraits of the people around the neighborhood which are now plastered one next to the other with the &#8220;meet&#8221; badge between them. The idea is not totally original, one of Tibor Kalman&#8217;s last projects was photographing people crossing Times Square, resulting in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/1576870456?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=uc-20&#038;link_code=as3&#038;camp=211189&#038;creative=373489&#038;creativeASIN=1576870456\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>1000 On 42nd Street<\/em><\/a> &mdash; but what is 100% original nowadays, right? &mdash; so what makes this work for the Downtown Crossing project is the build-up of the &#8220;meeting place&#8221; positioning and the use of the &#8220;meet&#8221; badge really ties this together. So even though the identity is slightly old, I thought it was, overall, an interesting branding story.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/downton_crossing_03.jpg\" alt=\"Downtown Crossing Logo, Have We Met Yet?\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/downton_crossing_04.jpg\" alt=\"Downtown Crossing Logo, Have We Met Yet?\" \/><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[63,12,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/726"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=726"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/726\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=726"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=726"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=726"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
