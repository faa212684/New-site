The channel has a double-life with morning programming aimed at children under the moniker of Zapp until 7:00 pm when it switches its demographic to teenagers and young adults and serves as a funnel for different content providers and broadcasters like VPRO, VARA, RVU, and NPS, with a range of programming that includes films, drama, and comedy (local and foreign) as well as the UEFA Champions League. A new identity and on-air system were recently designed by Amsterdam-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dogandpony.nl\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dog and Pony<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/woodwork.nl\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Woodwork Amsterdam<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"red_100\">Update:<\/span> The logo was designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/studiodumbar.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Studio Dumbar<\/a>.<\/strong><\/p><!--more--><blockquote>The challenge for Woodwork and Dog and Pony was to find a way to refresh the channel, based on the heritage of the previous styling and literally show more in different ways. Our solution was a dynamic grid based on the logo&#8217;s shape. Where views from different angles and perspectives can be visualized in a dynamic lens framework. Just like Nederland 3, it pushes boundaries, experiments, zooms, delays and shifts focus.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/woodwork.nl\/project\/nederland-3-rebranding\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Woodwork case study<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nederland3_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo and On-air Look for Nederlands 3 by Dog and Pony and Woodwork Amsterdam\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The grid also determines the promo package we developed for the channel, a modular system that can incorporate any piece of content, so every second of an evening&#8217;s programming can be displayed from start to finish. The grid brings to life what&#8217;s at the heart of Nederland 3: the more people see of the world, the better they understand it. Different perspectives, innovative programming, captivating viewing, all in one place.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/woodwork.nl\/project\/nederland-3-rebranding\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Woodwork case study<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/78258108?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=ffffff\"  frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>On-air graphics and concept introduction.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nederland3_screencaps.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and On-air Look for Nederlands 3 by Dog and Pony and Woodwork Amsterdam\" \/>\n<figcaption>A few screen captures.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old and new logos follow the same formula as the rest of the NPO family: big number inside a rounded-corner diamond shape. Clearly, diverging from that path isn&#8217;t an option and the new logo at least is now more readable as a 3 than a backwards &#8220;E&#8221;. The real success of this identity is how Woodwork and Dog and Pony have managed to take the ubiquitous shape of NPO&#8217;s aesthetic and turned it into a flexible and attractive framework to deploy the on-air package.<\/p>\n<p class=\"end\">There is a great combination between the strict, modular grid and the rich, free-flowing layers of type and footage &mdash; it&#8217;s funny that if you turned the grid 45 degrees this would be quite bland. There are a few nice details too like the subtle shadows between diamonds that create a great sense of depth or how the rounded corner of the logo let the imagery underneath show through within the hard-angled diamond shape it sits in. Overall, this is a deceivingly simple-looking system but one that has been very well crafted and considered.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Launched in 1988, Nederland 3 is one of the most popular public broadcast television channels in the Netherlands and is managed by NPO (Nederlandse Publieke Omroep, Netherlands Public Broadcasting).
