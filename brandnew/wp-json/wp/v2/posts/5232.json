As a quick recap: Established in 1935, Tyson Foods is a food company responsible for major consumer brands like the eponymous Tyson, Hillshire Farm, and Sara Lee, among others, covering pretty much every manufactured food need. The logo was presented last week without any design credit or further explanation and now we have a proper follow-up.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>The legacy of this company is one of food, family and a pioneering spirit.<br \/><br \/>We have always worked hard today while dreaming about what could be. From John Tyson&#8217;s decision to move his family to Arkansas and start something&#8211;to the company&#8217;s game-changing new purpose, Tyson is a family, and a business&#8211;of momentum, innovation and progress.<br \/><br \/>The weathervane is a farmer&#8217;s compass, it signals direction. At Tyson Foods, our compass points North, always forward.<br \/><br \/>Our monogram speaks to both the direction of the company&#8211;focused on the future, raising expectations&#8211;and its strong family roots.<\/blockquote><h3>Brand Union provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/kg-SJ1N5ITk\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo animation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>Our new color goes all the way back to the introduction of the Tyson&#8217;s Pride blue emblem, designed by Donald &#8220;Buddy&#8221; Wray.

Without exception it is warm, bold and authentic. More than any other visual element it is a tangible expression of our commitment to raising the world&#8217;s expectations for how much good food can do.<\/blockquote><h3>Brand Union provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tyson_followup_imagery.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Logo and Identity for Tyson Foods by Brand Union\" \/>\n<figcaption>Imagery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tyson_followup_office_02.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Logo and Identity for Tyson Foods by Brand Union\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tyson_followup_office_01.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Logo and Identity for Tyson Foods by Brand Union\" \/>\n<figcaption>Office interiors.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tyson_followup_sales_report.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Logo and Identity for Tyson Foods by Brand Union\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sales report.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tyson_followup_truck.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Logo and Identity for Tyson Foods by Brand Union\" \/>\n<figcaption>Truck.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The applications with imagery feel like <em>Martha Stewart Living<\/em> magazine spreads&#8230; which is not a bad thing at all and the darkish backgrounds of the photos help add a layer of corporate-ness. My only philosophical complaint would be that the imagery looks <em>too<\/em> nice, almost like that of a farm-to-table restaurant and, unfortunately, it&#8217;s not something I associate any of Tyson Foods&#8217; brands with. Their ambitions and way of talking about their company is great but I give my kids Tyson&#8217;s frozen chicken nuggets every now and then and they don&#8217;t look <em>anything<\/em> like those pictures.<\/p>\n<p class=\"end\">Nonetheless, it&#8217;s a lovely identity, well thought out, that has the potential of establishing the desired associations and bridge the realities of what the products of a major mainstream food company are with its mission and vision.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"After being Noted last Wednesday, Brand Union, responsible for the identity, was quick to let us know that some application images were on their way and here they are today.
