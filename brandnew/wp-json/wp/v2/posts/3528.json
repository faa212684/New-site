To help create this message that &#8220;no governments, no politicians or leaders can ignore&#8221;, A World at School worked with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.the-partners.com\/client#-upforschool-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Partners<\/a> to launch #UpForSchool with a new identity.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>First came the name: Up for School. Chosen for its affirmative, positive connotations, which fitted with the proactive, passionate ethos of Sarah Brown&#8217;s charities, its simplicity also meant that it could be easily used in a variety of contexts as a call to action (e.g. &#8216;Stand Up for School&#8217;, &#8216;Rise Up for School&#8217;, &#8216;Sign Up for School&#8217;.)<\/blockquote><h3>Provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/107904234?color=ffffff\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Initiative explanation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>Following on from the name, The Partners devised a vibrant, colourful, bold brand identity, inspired by the colour of children&#8217;s schoolbooks. The identity is focused around an illustration of a schoolbook in the shape of an upward arrow to support the forceful personality of the movement. The campaign launched in New York on 22 September with a youth rally in Washington Square Park, and saw The Partners&#8217; work rolled out across a film, T-shirts, badges, stickers, posters and banners all used to inspire and motivate the 500 youth ambassadors in 100 countries who will take the petition around the globe.<\/blockquote><h3>Provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/up_for_school_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Up For School by The Partners\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>It would be fairly easy to rhapsodize extensively about this logo but its smart simplicity doesn&#8217;t warrant over-thinking it: it&#8217;s an open book laying upside down to form the shape of an upwards arrow. It&#8217;s clever, appropriate, and graphically strong. It&#8217;s the kind of visual connection that seems so obvious once someone points it out but so elusive when you are the one trying to look for it. Such a simple solution, so cleanly executed.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/up_for_school_messaging.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Up For School by The Partners\" \/>\n<figcaption>Messaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/up_for_school_notebook.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Up For School by The Partners\" \/>\n<figcaption>Notebook.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/up_for_school_button.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Up For School by The Partners\" \/>\n<figcaption>Button.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/up_for_school_tshirt_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Up For School by The Partners\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/up_for_school_tshirt_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Up For School by The Partners\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/up_for_school_signs.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Up For School by The Partners\" \/>\n<figcaption>Photos from the launch rally at Washington Square Park in New York.

(I&#8217;m actually kind of glad we were spared the prototype images of the logo on a tote bag or that recurring billboard against the red building of an ad most organizations can&#8217;t afford to place.) The logo simply gets big or small depending on whether it&#8217;s on a button or t-shirt &mdash; both of which I&#8217;d totally sport &mdash; and a lot of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.myfonts.com\/fonts\/itc\/lubalin-graph\/?refby=ucllc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ITC Lubalin Graph<\/a> for the messaging. Nothing more, nothing less&hellip; all riding on the very precise logo that points the only way forward: Up.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Launched this past September, Up For School is call to action &quot;on behalf of 58 million children currently excluded from school because they are child labourers, married too young, discriminated against because they are girls, exploited or living in war-torn&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[12,79,26],"tags":[462,41,411,982],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3528"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3528"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3528\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3528"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3528"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3528"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
