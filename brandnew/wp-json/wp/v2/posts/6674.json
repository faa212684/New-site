From 2015 to 2018 the franchise was run by Virgin, operating as Virgin Trains East Coast; before that it was run by East Coast Main Line Company from 2009 to 2015; and before that things get long and not very interesting so we&#8217;ll skip it. The last time the LNER name was used was in 1948 and now it rides again under ownership of UK&#8217;s Department for Transport who took back the reigns from Virgin after it failed to run the line successfully. The new identity has been designed by Gloucestershire, UK-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.brandcooke.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brand Cooke<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>The transition from Virgin Trains East Coast (VTEC) had to be smooth one and it also needed to be cost effective. To bring back the &#8216;Apple Green&#8217; or &#8216;Garter Blue&#8217; colour palette from LNER&#8217;s glory years, when interiors of the new VTEC Azuma fleet had already been agreed and produced, would have been a costly exercise. We also wanted to make sure the rebrand from &#8216;Day One&#8217; was credible and not a sticking plaster exercise, and where possible we produced new collateral from scratch.<br \/><br \/>The bold but simple typography of LNER and the dynamic directional N acts as bold divider device for colour and images. Not everyone will know what LNER stands for so we also designed a descriptor to spell it out.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.brandcooke.com\/project\/lner\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brand Cooke project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lner_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for LNER by Brand Cooke\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo had the usual Virgin sub-brand-consistency-be-damned approach where each of their logos does some ugly thing and this was an exemplary specimen, with two beveled swooshes coming out of the Virgin logo with some haphazardly-sized and placed typography to complete the name. The new logo scrapes away all Virgin-ness except for the red color to maintain some continuity. It is rendered in a geometric sans (looks like it&#8217;s possibly based on Gotham) with exaggerated spikes in the &#8220;N&#8221;s. That gesture works decently in the acronym, creating a distinctive feature for the rail line; it&#8217;s not entirely pleasant though as there is a heaviness to that side of the acronym that makes it feel imbalanced. In the wordmark, the spiky &#8220;N&#8221;s &#8212; and there is a lot of them &#8212; look almost cartoonish or like a joke that didn&#8217;t know when to stop&#8230; not even when it got to the &#8220;W&#8221; and &#8220;A&#8221; in &#8220;RAILWAY&#8221; where the spikes shooting over and under the X-height is downright laughable (wherein we laugh at it, not with it).<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lner_logo_treatment.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for LNER by Brand Cooke\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lner_logo_treatment_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for LNER by Brand Cooke\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo treatment with split background.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The acronym is somewhat engagingly brought to life with a bold and striking background treatment that splits across the angle of the &#8220;N&#8221; into red and an image. The LNER typography holds up well with the busy backgrounds and certainly demands attention in the  applications.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lner_guidelines.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for LNER by Brand Cooke\" \/>\n<figcaption>Guidelines.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lner_azuma_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for LNER by Brand Cooke\" \/>\n<figcaption>Azuma logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The newest fleet of trains on the line are nicknamed Azuma and they use a flipped &#8220;N&#8221; as the &#8220;Z&#8221;.
