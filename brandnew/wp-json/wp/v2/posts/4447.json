Previously named Valad, 151 Properties has a clever new logo designed by the local <a href=\"http:\/\/futurebrand.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Futurebrand<\/a> team that I find completely fascinating. First, you have to <em>not<\/em> call the company Onefiftyone but One Five One and let the construction of the logo sink in for a second. It&#8217;s such a great idea and perfectly executed. It&#8217;s also a nice metaphor for what he company does: taking something that exists and transforming it. The applications are attractive as well with an unexpected combo of copper, black, and cobalt blue. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/32758749\/151-Property\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Robinson&#8217;s by Parallax<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_robinsons.jpg\" alt=\"Robinson's by Parallax\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/claridgecrash.com.au\/robinsons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Robinson&#8217;s<\/a> is a car accident repair service shop in Adelaide, Australia. (I should say was, as the business has since merged with another business that has a logo that&#8217;s an accident of its own.) If you&#8217;ve ever been to a car repair shop and I&#8217;m betting you have, I&#8217;m also betting you have <em>never<\/em> seen a car repair shop with a logo as kick-ass as Robinson&#8217;s. Designed by local firm, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.parallaxdesign.com.au\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Parallax<\/a>, the mono-thickness, script logo has a wonderful lo-fi, sci-fi, car-lettering vibe that is (clearly) hard to describe but easy to enjoy. The execution of the signage, outside and inside is far too cool. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.parallaxdesign.com.au\/work\/robinsons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Schmuque by b&uuml;ro uebele<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_schmuqe.gif\" alt=\"Schmuque by b&uuml;ro uebele\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/schmuque.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Schmuque<\/a> is a jewelry line by Stuttgart-based goldsmith, Julia M\u00fcnzing, who designs some really great and unexpected black-hued pieces. The identity by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.uebele.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">b&uuml;ro uebele<\/a> captures the elegant-yet-edgy aesthetic of her work through a stretching, sans serif typeface that starts out like a classic luxury wordmark but then elongates into almost unrecognizable shapes. I&#8217;ve always been a sucker for stretchy logos and this one is pretty satisfying most of the time &mdash; the &#8220;A&#8221; in particular doesn&#8217;t function as well. The playful typography looks great in applications and the black-and-white approach combined with the thicks-and-thins create great textures not fit for schmucks. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.uebele.com\/en\/projekte\/visuelle-identitaet\/schmuque.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Lots of fun typography and fun with typography this week, with work from Sydney, Adelaide, and Stuttgart&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[694,965,711],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4447"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4447"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4447\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4447"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4447"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4447"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
