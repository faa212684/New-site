Facing competition from growing global brands like Starbucks, Mondelez&#8217;s new coffee spin-off company, and the growing sense that instant coffee ain&#8217;t all that good, Nescaf&eacute; is launching a global brand campaign that aims to appeal to a whole new generation of coffee drinkers.

I remember it being the sole coffee delivery system in my house when I was kid. When I started &#8220;drinking&#8221; coffee in college in 1995 that was still what was available in my cupboard. Since then I&#8217;ve always thought of Nescaf&eacute; instant coffee as my parents&#8217; coffee. No offense mom and dad. Also, being part of a giant global manufacturer like Nestle, it never seemed like Nescaf&eacute; could be a cool, enjoyable thing to consume as part of a daily routine. So, now, they are trying to appeal to me as if it were 1995 and I have to admit that, even if the effort feels a little forced, they are not completely off the mark.<\/p>\n<p>The new logo does a very simple maneuver to refresh itself: go from a flared serif wordmark to a rounded-ish sans serif. Just like instant coffee, if you stir a rounded sans-serif enough you get a drinkable product. It&#8217;s not amazing but it instantly changes its vibe. Perhaps it&#8217;s a stretch but the new &#8220;E&#8221;s look like the mug&#8217;s handle. Pretty smart if it was on purpose. The focus of the new logo is the accent which I am guessing is made to look like steam coming out of a coffee mug. It&#8217;s a bit exaggerated but I guess if accents are about emphasis this is emphasized emphasis. The extended line off the &#8220;N&#8221; across the whole word is still dumb as rocks but, hey, equity is equity.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nescafe_fb_mug_shape.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Global Branding for Nescaf&eacute; by Various\" \/>\n<figcaption>Banking on the mug.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nescafe_fb_error.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Global Branding for Nescaf&eacute; by Various\" \/>\n<figcaption>A sense of humor.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>More than the logo I am really enjoying this aerial view of the mug. I&#8217;ll backtrack too: I find it an interesting approach that they have manufactured this iconic red mug that will come to represent Nescaf&eacute; as much as the logo and perhaps as instantly recognizable as a Tiffany &amp; Co. blue box. Back to the aerial view&hellip; it&#8217;s a quirky, iconic shape that is neither a square nor a circle but kind of the best of both, giving them a really ownable shape that works great to deliver simple graphic messages.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nescafe_fb_yinyang.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Global Branding for Nescaf&eacute; by Various\" \/>\n<figcaption>Yin-yang.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nescafe_mexico_words.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Global Branding for Nescaf&eacute; by Various\" \/>\n<figcaption>Inspirational Spanish words with accents.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nescafe_fb_covers.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Global Branding for Nescaf&eacute; by Various\" \/>\n<figcaption>Some cover images from the Facebook account.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>They are still a global, corporate brand so shitty ideas and poor executions are to be expected as in the two Facebook covers above. Just, no. But it will be interesting to see how much control Nescaf&eacute; can muster in really delivering a consistent brand across the globe.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nescafe_fb_postal_thing.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Global Branding for Nescaf&eacute; by Various\" \/>\n<figcaption>A rather nice extension of the mug&#8217;s top shape as a postage seal.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nescafe_packaging.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Global Branding for Nescaf&eacute; by Various\" \/>\n<figcaption>Some examples of new packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">Overall this is a significant effort by a giant company and product. I wish the rollout would be more strict and have as many of the digital Nescaf&eacute; presences turn over to the new look, but I do understand the complexities involved. It&#8217;s an uphill climb for Nescaf&eacute; to become a cool coffee brand for new or past audiences but this is a better start than expected.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Launched in 1938 in Switzerland by Nestle, Nescaf&eacute; is one of the world&#8217;s most distributed (not necessarily popular) brands of instant coffee, sold in over 180 countries.
