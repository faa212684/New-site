Whether designers should do it or not is really not the question, each person can decide what to do, but what&#8217;s clear is that the creative process and its manifestation is what suffers the most. A few months ago, Mexico City, through its Department of Tourism announced a contest to design the official logo for the city. Using the I&hearts;NY logo as an example of what it wanted to achieve it then set the following parameters: The logo should depict the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/El_\ufffdngel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Angel de la Independencia<\/a> monument and it should revolve around the theme of <em><a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/B\ufffdsame_Mucho\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">B&eacute;same Mucho<\/a><\/em>, the (rather lovely) song by Consuelo Vel&aacute;zquez. Anybody in the world could participate and vie for the prize of MX$1,000,000 (around US$73,000) to be filtered through a judging panel and the final winner selected by on-line voting. From 8,000 entries <a href=\"http:\/\/200.67.177.114\/votacion\/imagen.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">five finalists have been selected<\/a> (one has already been removed for copyright issues) and are available for voting. The results are disheartening (other than the <em>idea<\/em> of No. 4). You can also see a number of the entries <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/groups\/participantes_marca_ciudadmexico\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">on a Flickr pool<\/a>; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/huacuja\/3074803643\/in\/pool-participantes_marca_ciudadmexico\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this one is pretty fabulous (semi-NSFW)<\/a>. As a fellow Mexican and designer, it&#8217;s really sad to see this, Mexico City (<a href=\"http:\/\/olympic-museum.de\/design\/lancewyman\/wyman.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">if Lance Wyman proved anything<\/a>) could have an exciting and vibrant identity and someone leading the process, not just a silly contest that dangles money in front of people.
