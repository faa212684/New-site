The steamy subtropical Atlantic Forest of the east is a stark contrast to the dry, spiny wilderness of the Chaco, the location of the isolated Mennonite colonies.&#8221; At the end of March, Paraguay introduced its first country brand, designed by Asunci\u00f3n, Paraguay-based <a href=\"http:\/\/kausa.com.py\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kausa<\/a> in collaboration with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.uma-studio.com\/work\/paraguay\/?cs=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">UMA<\/a> &#8212; who appear to be the ones who did the actual design work while Kausa led the overall effort &#8212; and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bloom-consulting.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bloom Consulting<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>The central idea of the Paraguayan Brand is focused on &#8220;an economically fertile country&#8221;. The research carried out in the initial phase of the Paraguay Country Brand project revealed that Paraguay is a place where everything grows naturally, from an economic, political, legislative, natural and social point of view. With this in mind, three vectors were defined to develop the country&#8217;s economic fertility: &#8220;Growth&#8221;, &#8220;Wealth&#8221; and &#8220;Opportunity&#8221;. Each of these vectors are composed of six different variables that, together, constitute the economic fertility of the country.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.marcaparaguay.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Paraguay country brand site<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/I82tb7s0yGI\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Launch event remarks&#8230; Included because the video includes a video of the identity in animation; couldn&#8217;t find the source video on its own.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The Paraguay Brand logo reflects the central idea of the brand of &#8220;an economically fertile country&#8221;. The symbol represents three elements:<br \/><br \/>1) Flower<br \/>2) Sun<br \/>3) Gear<br \/><br \/>These three elements create a multidimensional logo that incorporates several characteristics of the country&#8217;s fertile economy: the flower represents growth, the sun represents wealth, and gear the opportunities offered by Paraguay.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.marcaparaguay.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Paraguay country brand site<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/paraguay_logo_explanation.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Paraguay by Kausa, UMA, and Bloom Consulting\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo explanation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/paraguay_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Paraguay by Kausa, UMA, and Bloom Consulting\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/paraguay_logo_colors.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Paraguay by Kausa, UMA, and Bloom Consulting\" \/>\n<figcaption>Color variations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The positioning for country brands or any brand in general are usually a bit eye-roll-y but I think this one &#8212; &#8220;an economically fertile country&#8221; &#8212; was quite interesting and a smart way to allude to the economy and the country&#8217;s natural beauty. It also paves the way nicely for the icon which, even without the graphic explanation, comes across as a flower while the blocky elements make it feel industrious. I like the explanation too of blending a flower, sun, and gear that manages to result in an attractive icon that somehow does feel South American. Online, some have complained it looks too much like <a href=\"https:\/\/chattilandia.wordpress.com\/2012\/05\/03\/ecuador-country-brand-marca-pais\/ecuador-country-brand-logo\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ecuador&#8217;s<\/a> which, maybe, yeah, but I doubt they set out to copy them, and Paraguay&#8217;s is much stronger as a logo. Unfortunately it has been paired with a very amateurish wordmark of forced geometry that even if it were done right makes it look more like a chain of children&#8217;s daycare centers than a country brand. While it sort of works in full color, the wordmark becomes truly hideous in single-color application and, when reduced, it&#8217;s even worse with super heavy blotches in all the characters where the circle meets the stick. To end on a nice note, I like how the single-color version separates the squares that touch in the icon.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/paraguay_identity_elements.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Paraguay by Kausa, UMA, and Bloom Consulting\" \/>\n<figcaption>Iconography.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/paraguay_illustrations.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Paraguay by Kausa, UMA, and Bloom Consulting\" \/>\n<figcaption>Compositions.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/paraguay_animation.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/paraguay_animation_02.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Paraguay by Kausa, UMA, and Bloom Consulting\" \/>\n<figcaption>Animations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The identity introduces a series of icons that do a great job in visualizing the many positive aspects, even the abstract ones like &#8220;growth&#8221;, of Paraguay. These are borderline good and bad&#8230; they are attractive and they come together great in composition and animation but, like the wordmark, I think they are far too playful and &#8220;basic&#8221; to represent a country. If these were overall less cute, they would be really great.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/paraguay_outdoor_ad.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Paraguay by Kausa, UMA, and Bloom Consulting\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/paraguay_outdoor_ad_2.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Paraguay by Kausa, UMA, and Bloom Consulting\" \/>\n<figcaption>Outdoor ad.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/paraguay_ad.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Paraguay by Kausa, UMA, and Bloom Consulting\" \/>\n<figcaption>Tiny poster to hold in your hands.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/paraguay_flags.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Paraguay by Kausa, UMA, and Bloom Consulting\" \/>\n<figcaption>Banners.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/paraguay_launch_event.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Paraguay by Kausa, UMA, and Bloom Consulting\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/paraguay_launch_event_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Paraguay by Kausa, UMA, and Bloom Consulting\" \/>\n<figcaption>Launch event.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">The applications are good and well done but all the cons I have mentioned about the wordmark and illustrations trickle down (or more like bubble up) to the applications where they lack some gravitas &#8212; the banners sort of get to what this identity should feel like. It would also be beneficial to see how this identity applies to photographs&#8230; that could provide an interesting way to temper the playfulness of the iconography which seems to be the only card they are playing. Overall, this is a good start and even with that wonky wordmark &#8212; or perhaps <em>because<\/em> of the wonky wordmark &#8212; this has the potential to be easily and widely recognizable as a symbol for Paraguay.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"I always have a hard time introducing countries or cities, especially ones I haven&apos;t visited, so I&apos;ll go with Lonely Planet&apos;s description: &quot;Paraguay is a country of remarkable contrasts: it&apos;s rustic and sophisticated; it&apos;s extremely poor and obscenely wealthy; it&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[64,12,26],"tags":[292,974,1401,308,319,1402],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5389"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=5389"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5389\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=5389"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=5389"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=5389"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
