Their goal is to have a homey and welcoming fee that is achieved in part, in this identity by <a href=\"http:\/\/anagrama.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Anagrama<\/a>, by the recurring use of a tartan pattern that looks half like a picnic tablecloth and half like a cozy blanket grammy made for you. The sand-colored and muted blue tones are unexpected and they work great with the gold foil accent. As usual, the combination of varied elements &mdash; vintage illustration, unusual typeface, centered layouts, and clash of materials &mdash; is very convincingly pulled off. The available products are perfect for buying and taking to a nearby beach to enjoy. <a href=\"http:\/\/anagrama.com\/portafolio\/222-bokeria\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Dawn Capital by Proxy<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_dawn.jpg\" alt=\"Dawn Capital by Proxy\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/dawncapital.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dawn Capital<\/a> is a London based venture capital firm specializing in financial technology investments. Especially when compared <a href=\"https:\/\/cdn.techhub.com\/images\/873edc49f9cf4ec2db9f396716bd039f.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">to the old logo<\/a>, the new one designed by London-based <a href=\"http:\/\/proxyventures.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Proxy<\/a>, is a bright ray of sun. Almost literally. The new wordmark, typeset in a minimal geometric sans serif, is punctuated by a rising sun dot. Although you could say the concept is no more impressive than a Type-as-Metaphor 101 exercise, this is perfectly done and actually used as it&#8217;s the kind of simple concept that many clients shy away from. Another big win is the use of yellow as, again, almost no client ever wants to use yellow as their brand color &mdash; Yellow Pages notwithstanding. The identity gives the capital firm a cheery and optimistic vibe without the shark attitude of most others in the industry. <a href=\"http:\/\/proxyventures.com\/projects\/dawn\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Casa de l Cura by Miguel Palmeiro<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_casa_de_l_cura.jpg\" alt=\"Casa de l Cura by Miguel Palmeiro\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Casa-de-l-Cura-1467287763598067\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Casa de l Cura<\/a> (either &#8220;House of the Priest&#8221; or &#8220;House of the Cure&#8221; in English) is a small hotel in the Tr\u00e1s-os-Montes province of Portugal. What it lacks in size it makes up in slickness, particularly in the environmental graphics by Porto-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.miguelpalmeiro.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Miguel Palmeiro<\/a>. Thin cuts in metal serve as the perfect physical interpretation of the thin, monoweight-line approach of the logo and graphics which, on their own, are fine but not impressive. It&#8217;s their starkness and crispness applied as minimally as possible against the beautiful hotel (and other hospitality accoutrements like the robe and pillow cover) that makes it all come together delightfully. Plus, we don&#8217;t see enough gourds in Friday Likes photos, so there is that too. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/25909331\/Casa-de-L-Cura\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"A mix of elaborate and minimal projects today, with work from Monterrey, London, and Porto&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[593,633,564],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4477"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4477"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4477\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4477"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4477"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4477"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
