In fact, it wasn&#8217;t until today, while googling around, that I finally made the connection that the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.spicyparis.com\/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">faux hot commercial with Paris Hilton soaping up a Bentley<\/a> was for Carl&#8217;s Jr. <em>And<\/em> for Hardee&#8217;s. Apparently my brand neurons never made a full synapse between these two places and Paris. Or that Hardee&#8217;s was the crazies that were pushing the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.msnbc.msn.com\/id\/6498304\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1420-calorie burger<\/a> earlier this century. Perhaps the reason is that I&#8217;m not their target audience: <em>Young, hungry guys<\/em>. I guess I am the three things: Relatively young, sometimes hungry and genderly a guy. But when put together, I prefer to disassociate from my brethren. And, hopefully, this too explains why I can&#8217;t bear the sight of these new logos and much less comprehend how &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/phx.corporate-ir.net\/phoenix.zhtml?c=117249&#038;p=irol-newsArticle&#038;ID=871290&#038;highlight=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">research showed that the new logos were seen as classier, more unique, more appealing and more attractive overall.<\/a>&#8220;<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/carls-jr_hardees_paris.jpg\" alt=\"Paris Hilton bites into a Carl's Jr. Burger\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Let me first say, that the two new logos are appropriate. They fit the market, and they blend into the current state of fast food chain identity design: Extra bubbly with a side of newness. But let&#8217;s not try to associate them with classiness nor uniqueness. In terms of design execution, a closer look at the logos reveals a lack of both attributes.

In some cases a Carl&#8217;s Jr. overtook an existing Hardee&#8217;s and, overall, Carl&#8217;s Jr.&#8217;s &#8220;Happy Star&#8221; ketchuped its way into the Hardee&#8217;s identity. The new, synchronized identity will have to be integrated into &mdash; as of January of 2006 &mdash; 1,049 Carl&#8217;s Jr. restaurants and 1,993 Hardee&#8217;s. That should feed plenty of young, hungry guys.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,69,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/473"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=473"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/473\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=473"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=473"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=473"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
