In an effort to keep a fresh face, Griffin&#8217;s brand mark is evolving for what looks like the fourth time since they opened their doors in 1992 (a snapshot of the changes on their <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.griffintechnology.com\/archives\/weve-changed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">blog<\/a>) introducing a new identity created in-house at the very end of last year.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>Universal appeal requires a visual identity that is globally iconic. At the center of Griffin&#8217;s new look is a distinctive orange mark that resembles a &#8220;G&#8221;. It presents users worldwide with a strong, cross-cultural image that is both forward-thinking and deeply rooted in Griffin brand tradition. Regardless of interpretation &mdash; a capital G, the internet&#8217;s ubiquitous &#8220;@&#8221; symbol, an ear, the word &#8220;Go&#8221; &mdash; the mark is a symbol of connection and relevance in the digital age, a design with different implications to different users. The Griffin name is featured alongside the mark in a new font and color palette, completing the logo. A new color palette gives distinction and appeal to Griffin&#8217;s ever-growing audience.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.griffintechnology.com\/press\/releases\/87\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press Release<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/griffin_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"Griffin\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The previous wordmark was a glut of generic visual language. Many had seen it debossed into plastic hardgoods or iPhone carrying cases, but who would remember the black and white color usage, in that rounded containing shape or quirky-but-not-quirky-enough typography? The revised orange icon certainly gets Griffin somewhere new, though it is hard to know exactly where. With so many rather accurate visual readings &mdash; a &#8220;G&#8221;, &#8220;@&#8221;, an ear, &#8220;Go&#8221;), it&#8217;s hard to remember exactly what it looks like when you walk away and does little to help reinforce who or what Griffin is and what they provide. The revised typography, while legible and timely, does nothing more to contribute toward defining a visual identity.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/griffin_packaging.jpg\" alt=\"Griffin\" \/><\/p>\n<blockquote>Another in-house creation, the 2010 packaging takes a simplified approach to consumer electronics packaging. It provides the customer with an easy way to decipher the visual message, and a distinct shape and sleeve design that makes for a unique un-boxing experience.<br \/>&mdash; Press Materials<\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/griffin_packaging_02.jpg\" alt=\"Griffin\" \/><\/p>\n<p>For a provider committed to product design and innovation, the revised brand seems to miss an opportunity to consider the three dimensional world of packaging and products that it lives in &mdash; contributing to an already crowded generic marketplace. Should they be known for audio products, portability or a web property?<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/griffin_ces_launch.jpg\" alt=\"Griffin\" \/><\/p>\n<blockquote>As a decidedly exciting and adventurous way to launch the new logo, five Griffin faithfuls crammed into an in-house restored VW bus for a 2,476 mile drive across country. We planned to stop in as many cities as possible between Nashville and Las Vegas to meet with Griffin fans. The itinerary ended in Las Vegas, where the bus came to rest in the Griffin booth on the CES show floor.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/cesbound.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cesbound.com<\/a><\/blockquote>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_100323_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_100323_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_100323_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_100323_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":4,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,51,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1058"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/4"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1058"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1058\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1058"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1058"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1058"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
