So, as a consumer, what this logo change signals to me about Kraft Foods is a company that can not make sound decisions to begin with and, once made, can not live with them. Which is a little harsh, but if we are to believe what we read in press releases, then let&#8217;s keep corporations accounted for their spin.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kraft_foods_redux_detail.gif\" alt=\"Kraft Foods Logo, Before and After\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kraft_foods_detail.gif\" alt=\"Kraft Foods Logo, Before and After\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>New and old logos in big.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The biggest problem of course is not what the press release said but what the change says about the logo and its elements: They are inconsequential. It doesn&#8217;t matter if the icon faces one way or another. It doesn&#8217;t matter if the shapes are in one order or the other. It doesn&#8217;t matter if the colors are solid or gradient. It doesn&#8217;t matter if the type is bold or light. It doesn&#8217;t matter if the smile is angled one way or another. These are all expendable visual cues that don&#8217;t require commitment or investment. There is no stake from the company in the logo. Of course, it doesn&#8217;t help at all that the new logo is no better at all than the old one, it&#8217;s simply rearranging the deck chairs on this logo Titanic.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MakeSeriously\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Make Seriously<\/a> for the tip.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,36,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/870"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=870"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/870\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=870"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=870"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=870"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
