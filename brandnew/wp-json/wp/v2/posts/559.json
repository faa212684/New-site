And that&#8217;s exactly what <a href=\"http:\/\/cgpartnersllc.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">C&amp;G Partners<\/a> celebrates in their design of the new identity for the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.darienlibrary.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Darien Public Library<\/a> in the affluent town of Darien, Connecticut.<\/p><!--more--><p>The library is consistently ranked in the top 10 of <a href=\"http:\/\/haplr-index.com\/HAPLR100.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hennen&#8217;s American Public Library Ratings<\/a> in the 10,000-population category, and will be moving into a new space in 2009, that will house 180,000 volumes and will feature all the necessary ammenities of a 21st Century library, including gallery space, caf&eacute;, children&#8217;s library, 170-person meeting room, improved technology, and, as the ultimate improvement, an identity designed by one of the best identity design firms. <\/p>\n<p>Headed by Steff Geissbuhler, the new logo is decidedly modern and, through the powerful icon design, heightens the importance of the library to levels usually reserved for major airlines, not public libraries in small towns of the U.S.. While the typography, and the <em>very<\/em> odd choice of leaving out the space between the two words, is nothing to fawn about, the icon is delightful. If you have ever flipped the pages of a book &mdash; and, yes, I&#8217;m being sarcastic, as everyone has &mdash; you can see and feel that motion in this logo, a rare feat for a static mark. I&#8217;m not certain, however, what this means for public libraries around the world&hellip; is this the new frontier in corporate identity?<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/darien_steff_02.jpg\" alt=\"Geissbuhler presents\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Geissbuhler presented the new identity at the annual meeting of the library.
