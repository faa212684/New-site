Despite racing&#8217;s global appeal, sponsorship participation is not at the same level as in other sports. Which is where we come in. <em>The Series<\/em> will lead to an evolution in horse racing. We will distance this incredible sport from the public perception that it&#8217;s a complicated, elitist recreation inextricably linked to gambling. We will provide a simple, accessible format that&#8217;s gripping, thrilling and unmissable. We will let betting take a back seat and incorporate innovative technology and data which will enhance the experience and provide opportunities to interact with fans. We will present horse racing to an entirely new global audience and re-affirm its status as the high profile, much-loved sport it has always been.&#8221;<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/championship_horse_racing_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Championship Horse Racing by Red Bee\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/championship_horse_racing_stationery.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Championship Horse Racing by Red Bee\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stationery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/championship_horse_racing_website.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Championship Horse Racing by Red Bee\" \/>\n<figcaption>Online presence.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/championship_horse_brochure.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Championship Horse Racing by Red Bee\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brochure.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/championship_horse_ad.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Championship Horse Racing by Red Bee\" \/>\n<figcaption>Ad.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/championship_horse_racing_kit.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Championship Horse Racing by Red Bee\" \/>\n<figcaption>Kit.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video controls controlsList=\"nodownload\" poster=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/championship_horse_racing_intro.jpg\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/championship_horse_racing_intro.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Event introduction.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"(Launching 2019) &quot;For anyone who loves the drama and entertainment of sport, Championship Horse Racing&apos;s innovative team-based format makes for compelling and involving viewing.
