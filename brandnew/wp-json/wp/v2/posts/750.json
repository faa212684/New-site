So it&#8217;s quite surprising to see Google change the Favicon once again, less than a year, which in branding time is like one week of building brand equity. It&#8217;s also surprising that, well, it&#8217;s terrible. The &#8220;g&#8221; is barely readable, the aliasing (jaggedy eges) on the rounded corners is crude and the overall feel is pretty pedestrian. This is perhaps too harsh a criticism for something as small as 16&times;16 pixels, but when it comes to Google every detail counts. <a href=\"http:\/\/googleblog.blogspot.com\/2009\/01\/googles-new-favicon.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The new Favicon is also the result of a weird call for entries encouraged by Google to create a new one<\/a>, and the design is based on one specific submission (which is better than the final one) and inspired by a few others (which are also better than the final one). All in all, a strange, unnecessary change.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Thanks to all that, nearly at the same time, sent the tip.<\/strong><span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,26,88],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/750"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=750"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/750\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=750"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=750"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=750"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
