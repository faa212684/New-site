(The number one in both instances, obvs, is Coke itself.) While its main flavor is orange, Fanta is available in over 100 flavors around the world where its available in 180 different markets. Earlier this year, Fanta introduced a new bottle designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/drinkworks.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Drinkworks<\/a> that is available in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fanta.pl\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Poland<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fanta.it\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Italy<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fanta.ro\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Romania<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fanta.rs\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Serbia<\/a>, and <a href=\"http:\/\/fanta.gsd.com.mt\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Malta<\/a>.

The goal is to continue to attract the attention of both young people of their mothers by inviting them to squeeze the unique taste of the fun.

The logo still holds well after 8 years and in most markets it will continue so there is no need to mourn it yet or, if you dislike the logo, there is no need to celebrate yet. The new logo answers the same challenge of &#8220;soda!&#8221;, &#8220;fun!&#8221;, &#8220;pay attention to me!&#8221; as well as the old logo in the polar opposite end of the spectrum: instead of curvy and plump letters it uses hard-angled, straight letters. Both are appropriate, both have its pros and cons. I actually like the new lettering in the logo a lot; it has a bold energy, a nice dimensional effect with some shadows (that are perhaps too subtle), and the smirk in the second &#8220;A&#8221; is cute enough. The leaf is terrible, unfortunately, and far too distracting as are the orange slices. If those two elements were better resolved this could be a really great soda logo.<\/p>\n<blockquote>The packaging becomes highly distinctive thanks to the asymmetrical silhouette &#8211; defined &#8220;slider&#8221; &#8211; with a &#8220;twist&#8221; (torsion) in the lower part, which makes it strong impact and attracts the presence of real orange juice.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.coca-colaitalia.it\/area-stampa\/comunicati-stampa\/fanta-stupisce-con-un-nuovo-look-e-un-nuovo-gusto-limone-e-fiori-di-sambuco\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Coca-Cola Italy press release (Google-translated)<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fanta_2016_bottle_before_after.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Fanta\" \/>\n<figcaption>Bottle, before and after.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fanta_2016_bottle_before_after_IRL.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Fanta\" \/>\n<figcaption>After and before, IRL. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BDD-_1qQBHL\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Photo by dennysdionigi<\/a>.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fanta_2016_bottle_first_renders.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Fanta\" \/>\n<figcaption>First renders by <a href=\"http:\/\/drinkworks.co.uk\/some-of-our-work\/worlds-first\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Drinkworks<\/a>.

The goal with this one was to make it look like squeezing an orange I suppose but, to me, it looks like wringing a wet rag. It&#8217;s not bad but maybe the effect is too exaggerated for its own good. It&#8217;s also like they just flipped the old bottle upside down and thought, &#8220;Huh, how about this?&#8221;. There is no real integration between bottle and new logo or label; it&#8217;s like the two things were brought together by parallel forces. (As a counter example of this done right, I&#8217;m thinking of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/new_logo_bottle_and_packaging_for_rivella_by_fuseproject.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">recent Rivella bottle-label-logo combo<\/a> that all comes together in harmony.)<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fanta_2016_visual_language.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>New visual language.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fanta_2016_visual_language.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Fanta\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fanta_2016_visual_language_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Fanta\" \/>\n<figcaption>Samples from Poland and Italy.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>As a bonus, Fanta is speaking a new visual language of what look like paper-cut letters and shapes that are meant to attract youngsters. This could potentially be good and while perusing their Instagram accounts it almost is but it falls apart at the details: the font NEEDED to be OpenType so that it would replace repeating characters with stylistic alternates so that all those &#8220;S&#8221;s and &#8220;E&#8221;s don&#8217;t look so repetitive. The square images also add fruits with funny looks that, again, could be very fun but the executions aren&#8217;t quite well resolved. While the paper-cut letters have some semblance to the letters in the logo, there is still a disconnect in style and approach that make the two elements clash.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fanta_2016_ad.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Fanta\" \/>\n<figcaption>Ad.

Overall, there is a lack of direction and consistency across elements and applications that maybe with time will settle into a better groove as there is some potential somewhere in all of this. Having different looks is to be expected from global brands but this might be pushing it in terms of creating unnecessary confusion and a sense of lack in quality control.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Introduced in 1940, Fanta is not just the second oldest brand of The Coca-Cola Company but also its second largest brand outside the U.S..
