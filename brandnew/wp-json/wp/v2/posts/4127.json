The best of the diagrams (not pictured) is the hours of operation graphic. The whole aesthetic is very well achieved through old clipart illustrations and a black and white palette. My favorite element is the logo in the middle cup above where the letters of the name disappear sequentially into a triangle. (Maybe they started disappearing because of the kerning on the far right &#8220;A&#8221;). Overall, I dig the dark-ish look that pairs well with the elixir that is coffee.  <a href=\"http:\/\/www.estudioyeye.com\/Almanegra\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Hidraulik by Huaman Studio<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_hidraulik.jpg\" alt=\"Hidraulik by Huaman Studio\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">Based in Barcelona, <a href=\"http:\/\/hidrauliktiles.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hidraulik<\/a> designs modular rugs that look like antique tiles. The product itself is quite stunning, at least based on the pictures. The identity, designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.huamanstudio.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Huaman Studio<\/a> certainly helps with the overall presentation. The logo, in Circular I believe, is very simply typeset over a dashed line, an abstract of the tiles and serves as the anchor for the beautiful, minimalist packaging. To boot, if the pictures explain it correctly, the same box can adapt &mdash; telescopically &mdash; to the three different tile sizes. Huaman also got to design their own set of tiles, called the <a href=\"http:\/\/hidrauliktiles.com\/en\/modern\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Modern<\/a> series. Not a bad gig. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.huamanstudio.com\/en\/projects-branding-hidraulik\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Gripoix by Mind<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_gripoix.jpg\" alt=\"Gripoix by Mind\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/gripoixparis.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gripoix<\/a> is a jewelry designer in Paris that designs gold structures encrusted with colorful glass beads in repeating patterns. This is echoed in the pattern by London-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.minddesign.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mind Design<\/a> of a looping line with colorful spots filled in and printed on gold ink. The dense pattern is contrasted by a <em>really<\/em> pretty wordmark, a rich man&#8217;s Optima, always rendered black on white. The two distinct elements play even better together in the packaging, where outer white boxes allow a strip of the pattern to be seen or the bags that are printed with the pattern on the inside. Overall, a beautiful, luxurious look that matches the product. <strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.minddesign.co.uk\/show.php?id=722&#038;pos=6&#038;cat=2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/strong> <span class=\"gray_70\">(<a href=\"http:\/\/bpando.org\/2015\/07\/28\/logo-gripoix\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Via BP&amp;O<\/a>)<\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"From dark and moody to colorful and decorative to crisp and luxurious &mdash; or some combinations thereabouts &mdash; with work from Chihuaha, Barcelona, and London&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[597,965,753],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4127"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4127"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4127\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4127"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4127"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4127"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
