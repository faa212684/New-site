It offers a robust experiential learning program, or &#8220;co-op&#8221;, through more than 3,100 businesses and organizations across the world that offer its students the opportunity to work and learn in real-world scenarios. Recently, Northeastern University introduced a new identity designed by Boston-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.upstatement.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Upstatement<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>Rather than create something entirely from scratch, we started by hitting the books &#8212; scouring the library and Northeastern archives for the graphic roots of the school. We discovered some unique and compelling elements to build on in the history seals, typography and athletics. We started with the seal and its hand-drawn typography from the 1930s, working outwards to define a typographic and expressive system. We worked with Jesse Ragan to craft a new nameplate to anchor a new, flexible brand architecture system. And then expanded that work to develop a custom typeface, Speare, that the school can own for years to come.<br \/><br \/>We redrew Northeastern&#8217;s iconic seal for legibility and balance, and elevated key elements to expand their brand across platforms, departments, and contexts.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.upstatement.com\/work\/northeastern-brand\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Upstatement project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/northeastern_university_seal_before_after.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Northeastern University by Upstatement\" \/>\n<figcaption>Seal, before and after.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/northeastern_university_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Northeastern University by Upstatement\" \/>\n<figcaption>Primary logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/northeastern_university_wordmark_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Northeastern University by Upstatement\" \/>\n<figcaption>Wordmark details.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo was fine &#8212; it could have stayed that way for another 50 years and no one would have complained but it&#8217;s always nice to see a thoughtful evolution for these kind of seal+serif university logos. The new seal is a major improvement, keeping most of the elements but making them all more readable, discernible, and enjoyable. The new wordmark, refined in collaboration with <a href=\"https:\/\/jesseragan.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jesse Ragan<\/a>, is excellent. A simple, traditional, bold serif that doesn&#8217;t try to be trendy or cool or clever. The &#8220;U&#8221; might be a little wide but that would be the only complaint.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/northeastern_university_additional.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Northeastern University by Upstatement\" \/>\n<figcaption>Additional identity elements.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/northeastern_university_n_lockup.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Northeastern University by Upstatement\" \/>\n<figcaption>&#8220;N&#8221; lock-up with motto.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Apart from the primary logo that contains the seal and wordmark &#8212; both of which can be used on their own &#8212; there are three additional identity elements &#8212; the motto (which means &#8220;Light, Truth, Courage&#8221;), an &#8220;N&#8221;, and a type ring &#8212; that can also be used on their own or in combination. All of them are crisp and elegant and I like how each is very different: the motto is a stacked sans serif sitting on curves, the &#8220;N&#8221; is a high contrast serif, and the ring is full-on type-on-a-circle. The &#8220;N&#8221; with the motto (or with the wordmark in some cases too) is a pretty nice combination.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/northeastern_university_custom_font.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Northeastern University by Upstatement\" \/>\n<figcaption>Custom font, Speare, by <a href=\"https:\/\/jesseragan.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jesse Ragan<\/a>.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The custom font looks great.
