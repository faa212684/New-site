Based around chicken or beef protein, Ollie customizes recipes for each dog and delivers a container (or containers) with suggested serving portions to last two weeks and require no cooking or further preparation. The company is based in New York and its meals are prepared in a third-party kitchen in Pennsylvania. The identity for Ollie has been designed by New York, NY-based <a href=\"http:\/\/communalcreative.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Communal Creative<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>After researching competitors in the pet food space, we realized that the market is saturated with the same type of brand language&#8211;organic textures and colors, promises of natural ingredients, and constant comparisons to wolves. We knew that personality would be a key differentiator in the visual identity, pairing it with transparency and a new point-of-view. Partnering with the Ollie team, we created a custom wordmark that evoked the warm, friendly vibe that is identifiable at the company&#8217;s core, pairing it with a modern, graphic visual language. We then set to work implementing these bold and vibrant elements over numerous touchpoints, from digital experiences to packaging executions.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/communalcreative.co\/ollie\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Communal Creative project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ollie_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Ollie by Communal Creative\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>I adore the logo.<\/p>\n<p>For a moment I considered making the above paragraph the full review but I guess that&#8217;s not giving you your money&#8217;s worth. The logo is very cute and curvy like the fatty folds of a newborn puppy but at the same time it has a keen retail vibe, making it look ready to hit the market and support the higher cost of its product. The name has a very fortuitous combination of letters for a logo, three sticks flanked by two circles, that provide an opportunity for something with great rhythm as is the case here and the spacing between letters, even with the limited set of script-y joints, has been handled beautifully.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ollie_materials_all.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Ollie by Communal Creative\" \/>\n<figcaption>Range of materials.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ollie_business_cards.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Ollie by Communal Creative\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.

The logo on the custom scoop and the lid of the containers looks amazing when raised out of the material. The supporting typeface is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.grillitype.com\/typefaces\/gt-walsheim\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GT Walsheim<\/a> and it works perfectly well. The one hiccup in the project are the dog illustrations that feel like they are from a completely different project; they are nice illustrations but the thinning, wispy aesthetic contrasts strangely with the rest of the bold and striking look. Overall though, a very solid identity right out of the gate for this start-up.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Launched this month, Ollie is an online subscription service of premium food for dogs, delivering freshly made food from real, human-grade ingredients every two weeks to subscribers.
