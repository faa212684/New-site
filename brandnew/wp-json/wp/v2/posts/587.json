There are a couple of firsts for this logo: The first, and the somewhat ridiculous, is that it&#8217;s the first logo unveiled a year in advance, which Dick Ebersol, Chairman, NBC Universal Sports and Olympics pegged as simply &#8220;an initial indication of how excited we are to broadcast the Super Bowl&#8221;; and, second, it&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sportslogos.net\/team.php?id=593\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the first Super Bowl logo to use green<\/a> &mdash; something that I found quite amazing actually, given that for three hours straight you are looking at a couple of dozen figurines (including the zebras) battling on a giant field of green, so go figure. The logo is meant &#8220;to reflect the natural elements of Tampa Bay, including the blue and green hues of the regional waterways and landscapes&#8221; and if you are wondering what the towering numbers in perspective represent, it&#8217;s &#8220;an abstract representation of <strong>a<\/strong> stadium and field.&#8221; Emphasis mine: Just <strong>a<\/strong> stadium? Any stadium? Okay. Like any major sports event logo, this one is meant to look bigger than life and exciting beyond belief, and it does so as well as the rest. The obvious critique is that this Super Bowl could take place anywhere, as there is nothing specific to Tampa Bay &mdash; maybe there is nothing about Tampa Bay to be specific about? &mdash; to make it unique, and neither did the last one, where at least something could have been made out of the Cardinal&#8217;s shiny new stadium&hellip; Maybe we are just seeing the start of the latest trend in this category: Perspective + Dimension + Stars +\/- Slab Serifs.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Thanks to Daniel Peck for the tip.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,26,87],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/587"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=587"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/587\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=587"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=587"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=587"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
