Photos, videos, messages, etc. MySpace died a natural death. Virb, however, was crushed by the imminent rise of Facebook with a nail in the coffin courtesy of Twitter. Acknowledging that they couldn&#8217;t compete with Facebook, Virb is re-emerging not as a social tool but as a website-building tool, harnessing the effectiveness of its personalization tools so that photographers can put up a decent portfolio or bands a decent promotional site. The new service also benefits from hosting company Media Temple being the parent company of Virb since 2008. While most companies who didn&#8217;t succeed at first would be compelled to change names and launch under a different personality, Virb is betting that its name, in good-standing condition with the web world, can handle the complete switch of service and business model.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>Our challenge was redesigning a brand already established with a face and reputation as a social network. Virb&#8217;s direction and mission &mdash; to build elegant and easy websites &mdash; led us to develop an identity that is simple and strong, keeping longevity in mind. Brands need to be extensible &mdash; to grow and be shaped aesthetically in different formats and presentations, but also to retain flexibility in how they are used when delivering a message, purpose or idea.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/team.virb.com\/post\/841826472\/virb-gets-a-facelift\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Naz Hamid, Principal of Weightshift, on Virb&#8217;s blog<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/virb_alternates.jpg\" alt=\"Virb\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/virb_in_use.gif\" alt=\"Virb\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The old logo was a perfectly acceptable wordmark and could have probably been used in the new Virb, but an effective identity redesign always helps to signal change and that&#8217;s exactly what this one, by San\nFrancisco-based <a href=\"http:\/\/weightshift.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Weightshift<\/a>, does. The visual change is pretty obvious: from extended chunkiness to condensed spryness. I&#8217;m not sure what the dot of the old one meant, but that has been replaced by a vibrant blue plus sign that adds a nice playful element to the logo, and signifies that Virb + You can make sweet design music together. I like the new logo quite a bit, that specific set of characters looks nice condensed and I like the &#8220;dirty&#8221; joints, makes it a little imperfect. The &#8220;V&#8221; on its own looks slightly flimsy and fragile, but I like how it keeps the position of the plus sign from where the &#8220;I&#8221; would and transforms it into a modifier of sorts. Overall, a nice rebrand, but the new market Virb is entering is already flooded with options, hopefully they can thrive and survive this time around. <\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.renaissancecreative.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Russel Quadros<\/a> for first tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_100729_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_100729_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_100729_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_100729_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,26,88],"tags":[273,274,275,112],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1161"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1161"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1161\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1161"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1161"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1161"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
