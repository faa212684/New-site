It&#8217;s a clear, coppery-colored amber ale that&#8217;s smooth and easy to drink. Fat Tire was inspired by a co-founder&#8217;s bicycle trip around Belgium, and the recipe incorporates the sweet aromas and flavors of his travels&#8211;toasty, caramel malts; fresh fennel, clean green apple; and sweet biscuits. If you enjoy smooth, medium-bodied beers, this ubiquitous craft beer is a tasty one to add to your reserve. In the craft brewing scene, Colorado-based New Belgium Brewing Company is quite the success story. Before 2002, you could only find its beers in 16 states; today, they are the country&#8217;s third largest craft brewery.&#8221; (<a href=\"https:\/\/drizly.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Drizly<\/a>)<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fat_tire_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Fat Tire by Durham Brand &amp; Co.\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fat_tire_old_packaging.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Fat Tire by Durham Brand &amp; Co.\" \/>\n<figcaption>OLD packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fat_tire_can_before_after.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Fat Tire by Durham Brand &amp; Co.\" \/>\n<figcaption>Can, before and after.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fat_tire_new_packaging.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Fat Tire by Durham Brand &amp; Co.\" \/>\n<figcaption>New packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fat_tire_cans_irl_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Fat Tire by Durham Brand &amp; Co.\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fat_tire_cans_irl_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Fat Tire by Durham Brand &amp; Co.\" \/>\n<figcaption>Cans IRL.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fat_tire_packs_irl_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Fat Tire by Durham Brand &amp; Co.\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fat_tire_packs_irl_04.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Fat Tire by Durham Brand &amp; Co.\" \/>\n<figcaption>Packs IRL.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fat_tire_badges.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Fat Tire by Durham Brand &amp; Co.\" \/>\n<figcaption>Badges.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fat_tire_swag.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Fat Tire by Durham Brand &amp; Co.\" \/>\n<figcaption>Swag.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"&quot;New Belgium Brewing&apos;s most well-known beer is Fat Tire Amber Ale.
