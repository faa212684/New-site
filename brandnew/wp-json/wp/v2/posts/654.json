While this is technically a Before\/After, <a href=\"http:\/\/alumnivacations.com\/images\/BreastCancer-logo.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the old logo was such a non-logo<\/a> that I decided to just let the new logo shine. Unlike most brands I cover, I don&#8217;t have any direct relationship or experience with breastcancer.org &mdash; which is a good thing, I think &mdash; so this is purely a reaction to the design and hearing about this site for the first time. Designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.siegelgale.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Siegel + Gale<\/a>, the logo is an intertwined pink ribbon forming a circle, giving a new execution and a fresh idea to the ubiquitous single pink ribbons in a loop. I also see a wreath, which can be seen as a welcoming sign on the door, but also as a crown, celebrating those who fight this battle. The color is both gentle and authoritative and the choice of Optima &mdash; a typeface I have been championing for some time now &mdash; is elegant, personable and familiar. For these and other gut reactions, I have to say this is one of my favorite logos of the year so far &mdash; it even looks great on the blue background, a color combination that, in theory, would be preposterous. The shading on the bottom-left part of the circle could be less flat, but it&#8217;s a minor quibble. This really establishes the web site as a leader in its field and for its audience.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[72,12,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/654"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=654"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/654\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=654"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=654"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=654"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
