The identity, by Lima-based <a href=\"http:\/\/infinito.pe\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Infinito<\/a>, references <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=mantos+andinos&#038;lr=lang_en&#038;tbs=lr:lang_1en&#038;source=lnms&#038;tbm=isch&#038;sa=X&#038;ved=0ahUKEwjaxd2P2NPJAhWEQCYKHYL3CMwQ_AUIBygB&#038;biw=1443&#038;bih=866\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Peruvian textiles<\/a> in a colorful and vibrant contemporary take. The name of the initiative is cleverly rendered using a limited range of geometric shapes and line patterns that, which each word used at different sizes, create a great range of textures. The color palette is the perfect combination to make all the elements come together. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/31388357\/Peru-Design-Net\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Bord 13 by Snask<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_bord13.jpg\" alt=\"Bord 13 by Snask\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/bord13.se\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bord 13<\/a> is restaurant and wine bar in Malm&ouml;, Sweden, focusing on contemporary cuisine. &#8220;Bord&#8221; means Table in Swedish and, like elevators that skip floor 13, some restaurants don&#8217;t have a number-13 table to serve, a taboo that Stockholm-based <a href=\"http:\/\/snask.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Snask<\/a> latched on to name the restaurant and design its almost-gloomy identity. Set against some odd illustrations by <a href=\"http:\/\/emilieflorin.se\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Emilie Florin<\/a> the monochromatic identity is spare and slightly enigmatic. I probably could have done without the illustrations as they feel distracting and the fuzzy, stencil Bord 13 logo by itself is distinctive and interesting enough. <a href=\"http:\/\/snask.com\/case\/bord-13\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Via Bahia by Raimundo Britto<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_viabahia.jpg\" alt=\"Via Bahia by Raimundo Britto\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">This is only a proposal by Salvador, Brazil-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/raimundobritto\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Raimundo Britto<\/a> and not a real project for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.viabahiasa.com.br\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Via Bahia<\/a>, a road\/highway company, which is sad, because it&#8217;s effin&#8217; genius or I have somehow missed someone else having figured out this visual pun before. &#8220;Via&#8221; means Road in English and a lot of important roads in Latin America are called Via This or Via That, they can be one-lane small roads or larger highway-ish roads. Raimundo has simplified and abstracted the name to reference the middle lane stripes of a road and showing one element going in one direction and the other element in the opposite direction, served perfectly by a &#8220;V&#8221; and an &#8220;A&#8221;. It&#8217;s such a simple and clever idea and it&#8217;s been executed exactly as it needed to be. The application images are pretty bad and clunky but that logo tho. <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/31018903\/Via-Bahia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/strong><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"From colorful and chipper to dark and gloomy to clever and minimal, we have a little of everything this week with work from Lima, Stockholm, and Salvador&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[540,308,564,437],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4387"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4387"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4387\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4387"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4387"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4387"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
