It is owned by Fox International Channels Benelux and Eredivisie Media &amp; Marketing CV, the company that manages corporate media and sponsorship rights for Eredivisie, the Dutch premier football league &#8212; which makes football the primary focus of all the Fox Sports channels, sprinkling some other sports in between. This week, Fox Sports Netherlands introduced a new identity and on-air look designed by London, UK-based <a href=\"https:\/\/dixonbaxi.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DixonBaxi<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>The heart of the challenge was to transform FOX Sports &#8211; which had a distinctly bold US-centric look to the &#8216;Home of Dutch Football&#8217; and make it more in sync with the needs of the localised Eredivisie-led focus of the Netherlands brand.<br \/><br \/>An essential part of the process to make FOX Sports Netherlands feel more localised was to streamline the FOX Sports logo and identity. DixonBaxi stripped back the logo to its most recognisable features and updated the typography. The new logo is simpler and confident &#8211; more in keeping with Dutch design and more practical for cross-platform use.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/dixonbaxi.com\/work\/foxsports\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DixonBaxi project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fox_sports_netherlands_logo_subbrands.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and On-air Look for Fox Sports Netherlands by DixonBaxi\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sub-brands.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fox_sports_netherlands_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and On-air Look for Fox Sports Netherlands by DixonBaxi\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>There is not much to say about the logo, in part because this project isn&#8217;t about the logo, but it&#8217;s contextually an improvement over the over-stylized version used in the U.S. and other markets. (I specifically said &#8220;contextually&#8221; because in the U.S. broadcast, the more gaudy logo &#8220;works&#8221; well with the over-the-top Fox graphics.) The cleaned-up version is fine and less annoying but mostly it just shows how dopey those swooshes are. The more mechanical &#8220;SPORTS&#8221; has been replaced by the custom monospace font for this project that doesn&#8217;t look like much on the logo but it&#8217;s all kinds of great outside it.<\/p>\n<blockquote>A simple square grid system is the foundation of our whole design language. Inspired by Total Football, where the entire team works together to create a system that allows free movement and self-expression and has become synonymous with Dutch football.<br \/><br \/>Every aspect of the design was defined by the square grid. From a bespoke monospaced typeface to a modular system for all on-air match graphics that has endless potential.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/dixonbaxi.com\/work\/foxsports\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DixonBaxi project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fox_sports_netherlands_system_inspiration.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and On-air Look for Fox Sports Netherlands by DixonBaxi\" \/>\n<figcaption>Identity system inspired by &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Total_Football\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Total Football<\/a>&#8220;.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>We worked with type designer Ondrej J\u00f3b (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.urtd.net\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Urtd<\/a>) to develop &#8216;Sparta&#8217; a bespoke typeface for FOX Sports. Named after the oldest professional team in Dutch Football, the bold graphic style encapsulates the energy and upfront attitude of the fans. Its distinctive square, monospaced style is designed to fit into the square grid structure &#8211; allowing it to move and react in motion like a team in full flow.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/dixonbaxi.com\/work\/foxsports\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DixonBaxi project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fox_sports_netherlands_custom_font_animated.gif\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and On-air Look for Fox Sports Netherlands by DixonBaxi\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fox_sports_netherlands_custom_font.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and On-air Look for Fox Sports Netherlands by DixonBaxi\" \/>\n<figcaption>Custom font.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fox_sports_netherlands_grid_numerals.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and On-air Look for Fox Sports Netherlands by DixonBaxi\" \/>\n<figcaption>Numerals at different sizes on the grid.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The custom font marries a couple of current trends &#8212; Brutalism and monospace fonts &#8212; into a bold, single-weight, unapologetic typographic language.
