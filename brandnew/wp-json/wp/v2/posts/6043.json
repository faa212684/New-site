The company offers ready-to-shake powders that have no GMO products, no gluten or soy, and no artificial flavors, colors, or sweetener &#8212; instead they provide natural energy from green tea, vitamins, and minerals. EBOOST is available in major chains like Walmart and Vitamin Shoppe and even college bookstores (gotta get those energy shots!). Earlier this year, EBOOST introduced a new logo and packaging designed by Brooklyn, NY-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.takeagander.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gander<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/eboost_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for EBOOST by Gander\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/eboost_color_combinations.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for EBOOST by Gander\" \/>\n<figcaption>Color combinations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo was okay; not great but not terribly bad either and it was better than <a href=\"https:\/\/d2iiahg0ip5afn.cloudfront.net\/media\/eboost\/eboost_arrow_feelgreat_sm.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the original version<\/a> that had some rocket-like effervescence thing going on. The new logo takes the name out of the arrow, which instantly gives both elements (icon and wordmark) more flexibility. The upward-right-pointing arrow now has a more unique design &#8212; as unique as upward-right-pointing arrows can be &#8212; with a subtle drop built into it. It&#8217;s a cool, chunky icon that does convey energy in some way, especially when rendered in the bright color combinations that, although operating within current trends, at least try to match up complementary colors and not just a shattering of weird-ass combinations. The wordmark is nothing fancy either, just a simple, strong, uppercase sans serif that establishes the simplicity of the brand across its packaging.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/eboost_old_look.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for EBOOST by Gander\" \/>\n<figcaption>Old packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/eboost_packaging_family.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for EBOOST by Gander\" \/>\n<figcaption>New packaging.

(The old energy shots had a cool look.) The new packaging goes into the expected minimalist territory but it still looks pretty attractive and exciting. The color combinations are strong and the balance of the elements is well calibrated. The product descriptions being the focal point and larger than anything else do provide a small and beneficial twist on typical packaging. The hero photography, used extensively on their website, does a great job in adding a cool, quirky, and bold visual attitude to the brand.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/eboost_packaging_powder.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for EBOOST by Gander\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/eboost_packaging_powder_flat_2.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for EBOOST by Gander\" \/>\n<figcaption>Super Powder.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/eboost_packaging_pow.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for EBOOST by Gander\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/eboost_packaging_pow_flat.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for EBOOST by Gander\" \/>\n<figcaption>Pre-Workout Powder.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/eboost_packaging_energy_shots_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for EBOOST by Gander\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/eboost_packaging_energy_shots_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for EBOOST by Gander\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/eboost_packaging_energy_shots_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for EBOOST by Gander\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/eboost_packaging_energy_shots_flat.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for EBOOST by Gander\" \/>\n<figcaption>Energy shots.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/eboost_packaging_spruce_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for EBOOST by Gander\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/eboost_packaging_spruce_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for EBOOST by Gander\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/eboost_packaging_gutcheck_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for EBOOST by Gander\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/eboost_packaging_gutcheck_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for EBOOST by Gander\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/eboost_packaging_wellness_flat.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for EBOOST by Gander\" \/>\n<figcaption>Wellness.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/eboost_packaging_protein.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for EBOOST by Gander\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/eboost_packaging_protein_flat.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for EBOOST by Gander\" \/>\n<figcaption>Protein.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/eboost_cap.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for EBOOST by Gander\" \/>\n<figcaption>Cap.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/eboost_tshirt.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for EBOOST by Gander\" \/>\n<figcaption>T-shirt.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">Overall, this is a solid update that gives EBOOST a more grown-up, confident look that relies on showcasing the benefits of the product instead of trying to scream for attention with lots of graphics.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Launched in 2007, EBOOST is a range of all-natural performance products that aim to &quot;increase energy, focus, and all-around well-being&quot;.
