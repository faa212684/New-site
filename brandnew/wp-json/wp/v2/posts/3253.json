Yup, crickets. (They are exceptionally nutritious and are amazing in <a href=\"https:\/\/lh6.googleusercontent.com\/_kdbw1lmE_uo\/Tb3NFEgICXI\/AAAAAAAAFFQ\/OSlCdE1IUHU\/s800\/IMG_0783.JPG\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tacos<\/a> with a little bit of lime). Each Exo bar contains about 40 crickets and three different flavors are available: Cacao Nut, PB&amp;J, and Cashew Ginger. Created by two nice, young fellows, Exo raised nearly $55,000 in its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kickstarter.com\/projects\/exoprotein\/exo-protein-bars-made-from-cricket-flour\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kickstarter campaign<\/a> and hit the market with an identity and packaging designed by New York, NY-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tag-collective.com\/exo\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tag Collective<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>There is something exciting about the Exo story that goes beyond crickets. As a branding team that has worked with companies of every size (from mega-corporations to tiny start-ups) we know there is a standard that start-ups are now able to match&#8211;specifically in consumer packaged goods. The accessibility of branding teams like ourselves, printers, co-packers and simple e-commerce platforms, is changing the scale at which products can enter the market. Sure, investors help, and it takes a level of know-how \/ tenacity, but the landscape is becoming friendlier to smaller brands.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/tag-collective\/from-taboo-to-table-e345041e5340\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Becca Eley, Tag Collective founder, on Medium<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/exo_id_elements.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Exo by Tag Collective\" \/>\n<figcaption>Identity elements.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/exo_business_cards.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Exo by Tag Collective\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The logo is remarkably simple in the right way: exo, all lowercase with the &#8220;x&#8221; extended to represent cricket antennas. It&#8217;s funny how the same concept that was applied to the previous logo of Cricket Wireless, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/new_logo_for_cricket_wireless.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">noted this past Monday<\/a>, turned out so crappy and this one so good. Which proves that <em>concept<\/em> is all fine and good but <em>execution<\/em> is what makes you puke in your mouth or not &mdash; crickets notwithstanding.<\/p>\n<blockquote>As the head of a branding firm, I could wax poetic about the meaning behind the mark, the inspiration for the color palette, the visual vernacular we formed with the iconography and typography&#8230; But when it comes down to it, we are most proud of bringing a new-to-the-world brand to the market in under a year. We built a brand, created copy, designed packaging and developed an e-commerce site &mdash; giving Exo all the toolsneeded to roll out three flavors in 10 months.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/tag-collective\/from-taboo-to-table-e345041e5340\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Becca Eley, Tag Collective founder, on Medium<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/exo_bars_front.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Exo by Tag Collective\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/exo_bars_detail.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Exo by Tag Collective\" \/>\n<figcaption>Bars.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/exo_box.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Exo by Tag Collective\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/exo_box_detail.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Exo by Tag Collective\" \/>\n<figcaption>Box.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">The bar packaging maintains the simple aesthetic with a nice, big, juicy logo at the top paired with a nutrition-label-like graphic with the product details. This helps the idea of eating crickets feel like a good, nutritious idea. The choice of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.emigre.com\/EF.php?fid=80\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Base Monospace<\/a> from Emigre gives it a cool, science-y look that makes it feel like scientists toiled away at these crickets for years. Pairing it with Futura doesn&#8217;t seem like the obvious answer but it works quite well. Overall, this is a significantly polished product that gets it right from the start and has all the ingredients in place to make its main ingredient appetizing, attractive, and approachable.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Launched this year, Exo is a new line of protein bars made from cricket flour &mdash; slow roasted and milled crickets.
