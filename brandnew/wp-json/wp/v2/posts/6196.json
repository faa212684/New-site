Mornflake is a family business, still independently owned and managed by the direct descendants of the original William Lea, over 15 generations ago. That&#8217;s a lot of breakfasts! Originally Mornflake milled oats for farmers, but now sells delicious milled product all over the world. Most of Mornflake&#8217;s grain is &#8216;contract grown&#8217; on specially selected farms throughout the United Kingdom. By placing these contracts Mornflake helps to conserve fantastic British agriculture, recognised globally for highly skilled farmers, superior technology and fertile soil &#038; subsidies from high rainfall, producing award winning crops. With expertise, skills and secrets handed down from fathers to sons and over 330 years of milling experience, it is no wonder that Mornflake is able to produce what is undeniably the finest range of oat cereals available today, winning international gold medals for the quality, purity and consistency of our oats year after year.&#8221;<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mornflake_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Mornflake by B&amp;B\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mornflake_lorry.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Mornflake by B&amp;B\" \/>\n<figcaption>Livery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mornflake_packaging_before_after.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Mornflake by B&amp;B\" \/>\n<figcaption>Packaging, before and after.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mornflake_core_bag.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Mornflake by B&amp;B\" \/>\n<figcaption>Flagship oats.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mornflake_granola.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Mornflake by B&amp;B\" \/>\n<figcaption>Granola.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mornflake_oatbran.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Mornflake by B&amp;B\" \/>\n<figcaption>Oatbran.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mornflake_superfast.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Mornflake by B&amp;B\" \/>\n<figcaption>Other oat variations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mornflake_one_of_each.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Mornflake by B&amp;B\" \/>\n<figcaption>One of each category.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"(Est. 1675) &quot;Mornflake is a cereal production company located in Crewe, Cheshire, United Kingdom.
