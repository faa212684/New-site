Sold only regionally in Northern Mexico through the 1980s, Topo Chico was introduced to all of Mexico in the early 1980s and exported to the U.S. in 1987. For some reason, Topo Chico is <em>huge<\/em> in Austin, TX &mdash; I had never heard of it before coming here. Now, the fizzy beverage is readying itself for even bigger expansion and has introduced a new logo and packaging designed by the Mexico City office of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.interbrand.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Interbrand<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/topo_chico_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Topo Chico by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/topo_chico_logo_cosntruction.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Topo Chico by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo construction.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>I will be first to admit that snow on typography is one of the most endearing things in the world. You can put snow on Helvetica and I&#8217;ll like it. The old logo had a very authentic vernacular charm. You could picture it painted on the wall outside a cantina. Despite this pleasing patina, it&#8217;s not the most efficient of logos and not the best executions of snow on type, looking more like cupcake frosting. The new logo does a great job in evolving its essence by keeping the structure of the wordmark and refining all its characters and paying homage to the snow with a white highlight across the top. The new letterforms are pleasing maintaing the playfulness of the original while adding some visual maturity. The only issue is the &#8220;p&#8221;, that stands out like a sore thumb without any curlycue or proper connection to the letter before or after. Other than that, all the maneuvers on the harsh terminals combined with the toothpaste-y terminals on the other end (as in the &#8220;C&#8221;) are really nice.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/topo_chico_princess_drawing.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Topo Chico by Interbrand\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/topo_chico_princess_evolution.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Topo Chico by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Princess drawing and evolution.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>I think I have had maybe two or three Topo Chicos in the six years I&#8217;ve been in Austin so I am definitely not their target base but I had never noticed the drawing of a princess drinking from the stream. It just looked like a blobby seal (of the wax kind, not the animal kind) on the label. The new drawing, that comes in a detailed engraving version and a more minimal one for the bottle, are wonderful depictions that add an instant sense of time and place for the product.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/topo_chico_coasters_elements.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Topo Chico by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Identity elements &mdash; typography, wordmark, and princess, as coasters.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/topo_chico_flyer.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Topo Chico by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Flyer of some kind.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Rounding out the identity elements is a custom type family that has a great Colonial-era feel with a modern approach that helps establish a consistent visual cue across all applications.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/topo_chico_cards_twine.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Topo Chico by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Cards of some kind.

The old one, no question, felt dated, undesigned, and without any consideration or attention to detail.
