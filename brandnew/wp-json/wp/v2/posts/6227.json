The same thing could be said about its identity by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.blokdesign.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Blok Design<\/a> who chose a handful of civic leaders from the city&#8217;s past to create charming illustrations of and use throughout the applications. Paired with a chiseled &#8220;C&#8221; monogram, a bold serif, and a condensed sans, the identity has a lively presence that evokes both old and new. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.blokdesign.com\/#\/client\/the-civic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">BeccaPR by LMNOP<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_beccapr.jpg\" alt=\"BeccaPR by LMNOP\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/beccapr.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BeccaPR<\/a> is a public relations and creative marketing agency in New York and Los Angeles, specializing in the hospitality industry. Their identity, by Brooklyn, NY-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lmnopcreative.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LMNOP<\/a> &#8212; great name! &#8212; is mostly a collection of a few trends (deadpan sans serif, curved typography, pastel colors) but it all comes together in an enjoyable way, through a cool combination of dark green and peach as well as good use of white space throughout the applications. Ultimately, maybe I just fell hard for the custom candy. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.lmnopcreative.com\/projects\/becca\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Misk by Studio Born<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_misk.jpg\" alt=\"Misk by Studio Born\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/miskistanbul.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Misk<\/a> is a flower boutique in Istanbul, Turkey, offering flowers, candles, and (of all things) picture frames. According to Google Translate, &#8220;misk&#8221; translates as &#8220;musk&#8221; &#8212; a &#8220;substance with a penetrating persistent odor obtained from a sac beneath the abdominal skin of the male musk deer and used as a perfume fixative&#8221; &#8212; which is an interesting word to build a brand around and also explains the deer icon in the identity designed by local firm <a href=\"https:\/\/www.studioborn.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Studio Born<\/a>. The hard-angled icon pairs nicely with the softer and more playful wordmark, which is my favorite part of the identity that, along with all the pretty colors, shows very well amidst all the flora of the shop.<span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.studioborn.co\/copy-of-adphorus-new\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Some restrained playfulness throughout this week&apos;s projects, with work from Toronto, Brooklyn, and Istanbul&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,85,86,26],"tags":[1228,393,556,647],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6227"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=6227"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6227\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=6227"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=6227"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=6227"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
