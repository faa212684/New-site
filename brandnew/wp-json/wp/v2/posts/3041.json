In the time since the company has expanded its product range to tights, as well as socks for men, women and children with products being sold under the Trimfit brand name and some licensed names, like Perry Ellis and DKNY while also establishing a bigger presence in Canada. Now, Trimfit is focusing on children&#8217;s socks and has introduced a new identity designed by Montreal-based <a href=\"http:\/\/wearebooth.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Booth<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/studioscope.ca\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Studio Scope<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/trimfit_old_look.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Trimfit by Booth and Studio Scope\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sample of previous look.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>Trimfit is a legacy brand, marking its hundredth year in the garment industry. The company desperately needed a brand refresh that would place them at the forefront of the children&#8217;s apparel business in North America. The challenge here was creating a brand that was accessible enough for the big box stores (in which Trimfit can be found at the entry level price-point) as well as boutique children&#8217;s clothing stores (in which they are positioned at a higher-end price point). With a distinct focus on brand recognition, we produced a streamlined visual platform and graphic language flexible enough for a variety of applications; a brand identity system that uses a fresh, contemporary palette of colours to distinguish itself against key competitors in the marketplace. Paper props were introduced to mirror the magic &#038; whimsy of childhood and a pattern was developed and applied across all collateral as a graphic device that not only serves as a unique identifier, but also adds a touch of playfulness to in-store displays. In doing so, we created a system that not only speaks to the child, but also the consumer.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/wearebooth.com\/#\/trimfit\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Booth case study<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/trimfit_logo_detail.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Trimfit by Booth and Studio Scope\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail and individual apparel marks.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Seeing a Comic Sans logo replaced is as monumental as a Saul Bass or Paul Rand logo getting the axe &mdash; it&#8217;s almost as if that naiveness needs to be safeguarded and preserved for all future generations of graphic designers to study and realize that, indeed, companies and products used Comic Sans as the basis for identifying their product or service. Obviously, though, good riddance: the old logo and packaging looked as cheap as it gets. The new logo is a lovely slab serif that looks both rugged and friendly, able to take the punishment of children&#8217;s feet while also looking adorable around those tiny toes. My main complaint about it would be that the &#8220;fi&#8221; is not a ligature, creating weird counterspaces at the end of the wordmark by having that tittle really tight to the &#8220;f&#8221; and leaving that last &#8220;t&#8221; hanging in the wind.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/trimfit_photography.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Trimfit by Booth and Studio Scope\" \/>\n<figcaption>Photography.

Overall, it&#8217;s an impressive transformation that places Trimfit as a competitor with other more well-known children brands.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1921 by three brothers selling wholesale hosiery to merchants in New York, Trimfit first grew in the 1930s when it sourced and sold Shirley Temple socks and when it acquired a textile factory to manufacture its own socks&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,51,26],"tags":[436,617,311,411],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3041"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3041"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3041\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3041"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3041"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3041"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
