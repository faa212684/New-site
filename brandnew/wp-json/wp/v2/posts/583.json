Since this identity launch is not official yet, there is little to no information, much less supporting graphics. But an update this&hellip; hellish, deserves special advance screening. According to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.capitalone.com\/onlinebanking\/color_change.php?linkid=WWW_1107_Z_08_HOME_R1_02_G_OBCC\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this page<\/a>, buried deep somewhere in the capitalone.com server, the new look (which you can delight yourself in while visiting that URL) will take place in late February, while, one of our tipsters informed me that the logo had been released internally since last summer. Regardless of when this will be official, it will not be a second too soon to bask in Swooshiness 3.0 &mdash; yes, it&#8217;s on a revival course. The old logo was nothing to admire, with its extended italic sans, and flimsy, subscript, italic serif [you can see a detail of it in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/capitalone_logo_detail.php\" onclick=\"window.open('https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/capitalone_logo_detail.php','popup','width=800,height=215,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false\">this pop-up<\/a>] but at least it didn&#8217;t have a swoosh. As I write this, I am actually glad there is no press release about the new logo, as I can&#8217;t imagine it being anything less than infuriating. Nothing, in the year 2008, can justify the use of a swoosh. Much less a swoosh with gradients and bevels. Even less for one of the major financial players in the U.S. &mdash; next time you check to see <a href=\"http:\/\/video.google.com\/videosearch?q=capital+one&#038;docid=-7756895709882424208\">what&#8217;s in your wallet<\/a>, really, check that you don&#8217;t have <em>this<\/em> in it. Perhaps we&#8217;ve been living in purgatory since 2000 and Xerox just opened the gates to hell &mdash; and hell looks like the Capital One logo.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,37,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/583"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=583"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/583\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=583"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=583"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=583"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
