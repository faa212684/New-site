The logo was a rare case of an italic wordmark in the real world making it work in unison with a bold and attention-grabbing identity. I can see how the extra colorful and shape-heavy identity would get tiring after a while and I can also imagine the relative frustration of working with an italic logo &#8212; it&#8217;s hard to align it, center it, and make it feel at home in a square-based digital world. The new logo is a no-brainer. I mean, could it be anything else in this non-tumultuous logo age? To its credit, this is a logo that benefits from a geometric sans serif. The circle &#8220;e&#8221; and &#8220;o&#8221; nestle in perfectly with the super straight &#8220;v&#8221;s. It&#8217;s no more or no less than it needs to be and it&#8217;s executed as crisp as possible. Does it make me dance like 1980s MTV was on? No, it doesn&#8217;t. (Then again, <em>nothing<\/em> makes me dance. Except getting married, and that was 15 years ago.)<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/vevo_2016_app_icon.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Vevo by Violet Office\" \/>\n<figcaption>App icon.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/vevo_2016_business_card.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Vevo by Violet Office\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/vevo_2016_tshirts.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Vevo by Violet Office\" \/>\n<figcaption>T-shirts.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The brief glimpse at applications&#8230; is fine. Nothing too exciting. \/ Side note: I&#8217;m noticing this new trend of Brutalist-like business cards where the bare minimum of information is all uniformly typeset in, like, 24pt type. \/ The best example of the identity in application is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.vevo.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the new website<\/a>, decked in black and white and with simple, crisp typography. The site feels more like Spotify now, rather than YouTube, and that&#8217;s a good shift in aesthetics as a way to present music. It&#8217;s also akin to Instagram going color-less, allowing the content to provide the color.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/vevo_2016_old_subbrands.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Vevo by Violet Office\" \/>\n<figcaption>Old sub-brands.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/vevo_2016_hot_this_week_new.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Vevo by Violet Office\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/vevo_2016_60_with_new.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Vevo by Violet Office\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/vevo_2016_lift_new.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Vevo by Violet Office\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/vevo_2016_rhyme_and_reason_new.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Vevo by Violet Office\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/vevo_2016_presents.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Vevo by Violet Office\" \/>\n<figcaption>New sub-brands.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The sub-brands are a simple extension of the logo and identity, some with more personality than others, some tying in more with the system than others but they do establish a house style for new additions.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/vevo_2016_genre_art.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Vevo by Violet Office\" \/>\n<figcaption>Background for the different genre categories.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/vevo_2016_onboarding_genre.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Vevo by Violet Office\" \/>\n<figcaption>Genre options on mobile.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">Finally, there is the introduction of some weird abstract artwork to illustrate the different genres you can browse through. They are so completely random and unrelated to anything else that they almost make sense. But, unfortunately, they don&#8217;t. Some geometric abstract, flat artwork patterns might have done the trick and felt more in tune. Overall, it&#8217;s kinda sad (but understandable) to see the old identity go away as it had plenty of personality that this new one doesn&#8217;t quite have but that, in its favor, signals a coming-of-age, ready-for-business stage for Vevo.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 2009 by music production companies Sony Music Entertainment and Universal Music Group, Vevo is a music video and entertainment platform with a library of over 230,000 videos, exclusive original programming, and live concert performances.
