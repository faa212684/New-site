For the more than twenty-one years I lived in Mexico I think I sent no more than five letters through the postal service. In part because at that age I had no one to send letters to but also because it just didn&#8217;t feel like anything would get anywhere, as it&#8217;s a slow under-developed service and most people pay their bills by going to the bank or to the utility&#8217;s offices. Even now, when I send Holiday cards from the U.S. I am always surprised that they get to their final destination before the beginning of a new year. Just to give you an example of the difference in use of the postal service: For each citizen Mexico delivers seven letters a year, and the U.S. delivers 700, granted, a lot of it are coupons and offers to credit cards with low-interest rates, but still.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/correos_de_mexico_03.jpg\" alt=\"Correos de Mexico\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This past Monday, Felipe Calder&oacute;n, the President of Mexico, helped unveil the new identity and offered a sense of hope for the service alluding to anything that could give citizens a sense of security and confidence in the service: Better, well, service, facilities with Internet, more inspectors, etc. In this case, a drastic new image is perhaps the best way to signal change. And nothing signals better than lime green and hot pink &mdash; colors often seen throughout Mexico but rarely in government services. While the old uniforms were a typical mundane blue and white, the new ones will bring inherent attention to the mailmen and mailwomen in the public &mdash; I think seeing them milling around the city would help in letting the customers know that, indeed, people are transporting letters from one place to another.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/correos_de_mexico_01.jpg\" alt=\"Correos de Mexico\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/correos_de_mexico_02.jpg\" alt=\"Correos de Mexico\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The logo itself is nothing to bask about. It&#8217;s a rather simplistic drawing and the change from an eagle to a pigeon seems odd. The new name is actually an old name, which goes back to the beginning of the twentieth century, so I guess they are going for tradition and nostalgia with the idea of a pigeon <strike>hand-delivering<\/strike> beak-delivering your mail. The typeface looks as default as it can be, I don&#8217;t even know what it is, but I do like the hot pink accent over the &#8220;E&#8221;. So, overall, it&#8217;s a great way to define a new era for the postal service, but the execution leaves a lot to be desired.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/correos_de_mexico_04.jpg\" alt=\"Correos de Mexico\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/correos_de_mexico_05.jpg\" alt=\"Correos de Mexico\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.graphicology.com\/blog\/2008\/9\/10\/197-mexican-mail-pink-and-green.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">JJ<\/a> for the tip.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,76,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/695"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=695"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/695\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=695"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=695"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=695"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
