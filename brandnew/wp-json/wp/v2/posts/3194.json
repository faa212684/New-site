Now recognized as one of America&#8217;s leading orchestras, the ensemble presents nearly 175 concerts in a typical season, heard live by 350,000 people, including more than 50,000 students who attend Young People&#8217;s Concerts each year. The Orchestra has toured regionally, nationally and internationally, earning rave reviews in music capitals around the world, and is heard on radio stations across the country on award-winning broadcasts produced by Minnesota Public Radio and distributed nationally and internationally. It has received many awards for adventurous programming and much acclaim for its vast collection of recordings, which date back to the 1920s. Most recently, the Orchestra earned its first Grammy Award for a recording of two Sibelius symphonies made under its current music director, Osmo V&auml;nsk&auml;. The Orchestra makes its home at Orchestra Hall in Minneapolis, a venue which reopened earlier this year after a major renovation.&#8221;<\/p><!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/minnesota_orchestra_orchestra.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Minnesota Orchestra by Capsule\" \/>\n<figcaption>The actual orchestra hall.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/minnesota_orchestra_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Minnesota Orchestra by Capsule\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/minnesota_orchestra_standards.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Minnesota Orchestra by Capsule\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sample images of the guidelines.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/minnesota_orchestra_orchestra_hall_logo.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Minnesota Orchestra by Capsule\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo for the Orchestra Hall.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"&quot;The Minnesota Orchestra performed its inaugural concert in November 1903, six weeks before the Wright brothers made their first airplane flight.
