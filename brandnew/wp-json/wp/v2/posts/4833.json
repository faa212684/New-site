Owned by Nestle since 2002, they are the exact same ice cream with the same flavors and recipes but, using the Rocky Mountains as a geographic divider, Dreyer&#8217;s is the brand name used in the West side of the U.S. and Edy&#8217;s in the East. The main reason being that a similar-sounding ice cream brand, <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Breyers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Breyer&#8217;s<\/a>, was already sold in the East. The names refer to the original founders, William Dreyer and Joseph Edy. Recently, Dreyer&#8217;s and Edy&#8217;s introduced new logos and packaging designed by the San Francisco, CA, office of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sterlingbrands.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sterling Brands<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>Our re-design leverages the nostalgic appeal of ice cream, bringing families together while elevating key ingredient messaging to convey the brand&#8217;s quality commitment.

The little jumpman &#8212; surprised the original <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jumpman_(logo)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">original jumpman<\/a> never sued them &#8212; with the ice cream was cute and felt very much like an extension of the typography. The new logos get rid of the nice lettering and introduce a soft-cornered serif instead with far less personality and a more straight-out-of-the-box aesthetic. The jumpmpan has been replaced with just a cone and some rather cheap-looking script font has been added as the tagline. The double personality of the brand has always posed a problem in that they try to keep the same holding shape for both names but Edy&#8217;s is painfully shorter so it leaves a wide gap to its sides and the challenge is more evident in the new Edy&#8217;s logo where the name has been letterspaced more than it can handle and the letters have been poorly extended &#8212; looks like they were stretched horizontally and then the serifs and terminals were somewhat adjusted. Needless to say, I&#8217;m not a fan of the change. Any premium quality the old logos managed to convey is gone and if the goal was to look less premium, then mission accomplished.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/dreyers_ice_cream_packaging_chocolate_before_after.jpg\" alt=\"New Logos and Packaging for Dreyer&amp;apos;s and Edy&amp;apos;s Ice Cream by Sterling Brands\" \/>\n<figcaption>&#8220;Grand&#8221; line of ice cream packaging, before and after.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/dreyers_ice_cream_packaging_chocolate.jpg\" alt=\"New Logos and Packaging for Dreyer&amp;apos;s and Edy&amp;apos;s Ice Cream by Sterling Brands\" \/>\n<figcaption>Grand Chocolate packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old packaging was what you would expect from mainstream ice cream packaging: no high-end concept, some slightly obnoxious graphics, big image of the product. The new packaging is a better improvement than the logo, at least at first glance. The logo is somewhat cleverly integrated with the cone and scoop of ice cream and the backgrounds have been changed from mystery swirls to a tiling of brand messaging in what are meant to look like hand-drawn, hand-lettered bits of vintage typography. The effect from far away is engaging and a much better alternative to what they have now. Unfortunately, on closer inspection, the execution is halfway what it should be.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/dreyers_ice_cream_packaging_chocolate_detail.jpg\" alt=\"New Logos and Packaging for Dreyer&amp;apos;s and Edy&amp;apos;s Ice Cream by Sterling Brands\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/dreyers_ice_cream_packaging_chocolate_detail_2.jpg\" alt=\"New Logos and Packaging for Dreyer&amp;apos;s and Edy&amp;apos;s Ice Cream by Sterling Brands\" \/>\n<figcaption>Very close up close-ups.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>While well-meaning, all the typography and illustrations feel very stock-like and rushed.

Despite the system actually being extendable across the different ranges and flavors, unfortunately, it&#8217;s too many things, too many styles, too much stuff on top of the other, and far too many typefaces to come across as cohesive stand-alone packages.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1928, Dreyer&apos;s and Edy&apos;s are a line of ice cream in the so-so category that sits somewhere between H\u00e4agen-Dazs and anything that comes in the size of a tub.
