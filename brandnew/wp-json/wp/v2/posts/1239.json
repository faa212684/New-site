The redesigned Artyarns logo is one of three &#8220;brand makeovers&#8221; that small businesses have undergone through <a href=\"http:\/\/www.openforum.com\/projectrebrand\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Project RE:Brand<\/a> by American Express OPEN Forum which has paired them with a design firm or ad agency. This exercise is actually quite interesting, not so much because of the results &mdash; the above is the better of the three &mdash; but because it manages to cover many important aspects of a redesign that may be both unknown and scary for small businesses who are considering one. Each project comes with a case study as well as supporting articles that elaborate on topics like &#8220;Why Branding?&#8221; to &#8220;Tips for Competing in the Luxury Market.&#8221; These may not be the most groundbreaking white papers on our practice, but for the audience of American Express&#8217; OPEN &mdash; small businesses and entrepreneurs &mdash; it&#8217;s perfect.
