Even after the devastating effects that the city went through, it is still one of the nation&#8217;s most flavorful, with its music roots keeping it afloat and its unique architecture and texture shining through. The All-Star logo &mdash; in all of its polished professionalism, typical sports semi-dimensionality and inevitable, expected, city-centric visual cues &mdash; manages to convey some personality and add a little spice to the anticlimactic, &uuml;ber family friendly affair that the All-Star game has turned into. The &#8220;All-Star&#8221; custom typography is quite smooth and has a nice vintage smell to it, nicely complemented by the iron work line art &#8220;growing&#8221; from the basketball at the bottom.
