Towers Watson offers services in Benefits (retirement, health and group benefits), Risk and Financial Services (insurance consolation, investments, risk management), and Talent and Rewards (executive compensation, employee rewards), all of it a nice presented package that is actually easy to understand. With a new name that literally merges the two companies, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.interbrand.com\/case_study.aspx?caseid=1204&#038;langid=1000\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Interbrand was given the assignment to create the new visual identity<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>It became evident that Towers Watson&#8217;s primary strength would be its combined attention to relationships, both with clients and employees. Through workshops and discussions about personality and brand archetypes, a strategic positioning, &#8220;Clarity through perspective,&#8221; was developed that would guide and support the creative development.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.interbrand.com\/case_study.aspx?caseid=1204&#038;langid=1000\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Interbrand Project Description<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/towers_watson_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"Towers Watson\" \/><\/p>\n<blockquote>The new logo represents each Towers Watson&#8217;s employees&#8217; personal commitment to its customers by &#8220;putting their names on the line&#8221; with a personal signature of the company. The identity is a combination of a strong, pragmatic wordmark and an approachable signature symbol. The organic, hand-drawn nature of the logo and graphic system creates a personal and distinctive look amidst the impersonal, corporate, language of its competitors. To echo the hand-drawn nature of the logo, a customized, scripted typeface was created along with a library of illustrations.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.interbrand.com\/case_study.aspx?caseid=1204&#038;langid=1000\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Interbrand Project Description<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p>The new logo strikes a pretty good balance between seriousness and friendliness. The wordmark is as buttoned-up as it gets, all uppercase and black as a CEO suit, and it&#8217;s so refreshing to not get another all lowercase rounded wordmark. Meanwhile the TW monogram is loose and dynamic and makes a nice complement in shape and color to the name. I typically don&#8217;t like to say &#8220;This logo looks like&hellip;&#8221; but I was reminded of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wynnlasvegas.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wynn<\/a> brand. First, formally, as it&#8217;s a signature. But, second, philosophically, as a way to humanize an out-of-scale organization.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/towers_watson_clarity_mister_k.jpg\" alt=\"Mister K for TW\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><strike>Clarity, a proprietary handwritten font for Towers Watson<\/strike>. <strike>Image removed by request<\/strike>.

The thick boxes behind text is nothing new, and Franklin Gothic is fairly conventional choice, but in conjunction with the handwritten font, it all manages to feel contemporary enough. Overall, a solid introduction for this new company.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/towers_watson_sign.jpg\" alt=\"Towers Watson\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yotamhadar.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Yotam Hadar<\/a> for the tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_100120_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_100120_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_100120_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_100120_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,36,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1010"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1010"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1010\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1010"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1010"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1010"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
