Based in a hangar in Denver, CO, Boom is currently developing the XB-1, their first test aircraft which will pave the way for Overture, their 55-seat commercial passenger jet &#8212; with ticket costs priced around what people currently pay for business class &#8212; that will cut travel times by almost 60% flying at Mach 2.2, e.g., New York to London in 3.5 hours. Japan Airlines and Virgin Group have already pre-ordered 20 and 10 planes respectively.

We worked closely with the Boom team to name and strategically position their future commercial airliner, Overture, as a benchmark in supersonic business travel with the potential to radically change the way people experience long distance travel.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/manualcreative.com\/project\/boom-supersonic\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Manual project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/boom_supersonic_logo_a.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Boom by Manual\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/boom_supersonic_logo_extensions.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Boom by Manual\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logos for the company, Boom; the test plane, XB-1; and the eventual commercial passenger jet, Overture.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/309362734?title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"360\" height=\"203\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo animation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Although it wasn&#8217;t quite right, there is something I liked about the old logo, particularly the icon that looked like a diagram of something passing fast through a portal (i.e., breaking the sound barrier). The new logo is much more refined and less heavy-handed on the &#8220;this thing is fast!&#8221; narrative. The icon is a lovely abstraction of&#8230; flight. It&#8217;s kind of nothing and everything. To me it looks like a front view of a bird&#8217;s flapping wings captured as a composite but it could also be seen as a propeller. Although its overall shape is symmetrical, the asymmetry within it is great. The only thing I wonder is if the individual shapes of the icon would have been better in more hard-angled caps instead of the rounded caps.

It&#8217;s an understated detail and probably no one will see the yellow bar on the bottom of a letterhead and think, &#8220;Of course, Peregrine falcons!&#8221; but it&#8217;s the kind of reasoned decision that brings joy to my logo-reviewing world.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/boom_supersonic_business_cards.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Boom by Manual\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business card.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/boom_supersonic_brochure.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Boom by Manual\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brochure.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/boom_supersonic_handout_cover.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Boom by Manual\" \/>\n<figcaption>Handout cover.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/boom_supersonic_poster.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Boom by Manual\" \/>\n<figcaption>Poster.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/boom_supersonic_XB1_data_sheet_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Boom by Manual\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/boom_supersonic_XB1_data_sheet.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Boom by Manual\" \/>\n<figcaption>XB-1 data sheets.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The applications all have a good mix of elegance and tehnicality through great use of white space and the choice of Styrene, which has such a unique aesthetic.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/boom_supersonic_overture_model_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Boom by Manual\" \/>\n<figcaption>Model airplane.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/boom_supersonic_overture_model_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Boom by Manual\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/boom_supersonic_overture_model_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Boom by Manual\" \/>\n<figcaption>Model airplane packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The packaging for the little model airplane features the yellow bars again as well as generous white space and a cool line drawing of the plane that make the boxes look like luxurious blueprints.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/boom_supersonic_overture_livery_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Boom by Manual\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/boom_supersonic_overture_livery_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Boom by Manual\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/boom_supersonic_overture_livery_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Boom by Manual\" \/>\n<figcaption>Overture livery.

Overall, this is an identity that looks like the millions and billions of dollars being invested in the technology as well as worth the thousands of dollars passengers will plunk down to get to where they are going fast.
