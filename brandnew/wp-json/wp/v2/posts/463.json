This is a huge departure. I am always amazed and pleased when a company which never embraced design, suddenly realizes what it and branding can do for them. It doesn&#8217;t just take insight, but it takes guts and quite a budget as well.<\/p><!--more--><p>Quickly, PWC Logistics was recently rebranded as<a href=\"http:\/\/www.agilitylogistics.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> Agility<\/a>. Wether or not you like the new dragon identity that<a href=\"http:\/\/www.siegelgale.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> Siegel+Gale <\/a>designed is almost irrelevant. Agility has embraced design and branding. Hopefully they do something with it and their business improves. I do like the new mark, I like the colors they have chosen and the name (I can&#8217;t believe they were able to get it) is nice too. <\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s funny when I hear people say they can tell what consultancy did a mark just by looking at it. I think it&#8217;s tough since many of them have similar philosophies and processes but especially since there is such a small, shared talent pool. If you have worked at one top brand consultancy, chances are you&#8217;ve worked at three.  Incidentally, when I looked at this I thought it was Enterprise IG. Oh well.<\/p>\n<p>A close-up of the new mark<br \/>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Brandnew_Agility_CloseUp.gif\" src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Brandnew_Agility_CloseUp.gif\" width=\"470\" height=\"350\" \/><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.pwclogistics.com\/news_info\/Agility.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The press release<\/a><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":14,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,76,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/463"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/14"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=463"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/463\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=463"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=463"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=463"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
