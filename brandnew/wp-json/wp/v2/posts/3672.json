Owned by Itella Corporation &mdash; a company offering postal, financial administration process, and logistics services in eleven European countries &mdash; it operates over 1,300 retail outlets; 7,000 mailboxes; and 4,000 commercial vehicles. Yesterday, it was announced that as of January 2015, Itella will change its corporate name to Posti Group Corporation and the retail operation will begin using a new identity designed by Helsinki-based <a href=\"http:\/\/n2nolla.fi\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">N2 Nolla<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/posti_existing_look.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Posti by N2 Nolla\" \/>\n<figcaption>A few samples of the existing look.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>I wasn&#8217;t familiar with the previous logo and dot-y identity but it&#8217;s pretty good and from the few images I perused online it seems there is a lot of equity in the orange and blue circles, particularly evident in the letterboxes. The press release explains that &#8220;the renewal will show not only in the change of name, but also in the corporate structure, business organizations, service content and the service culture. The renewals are part of the strategy published last year, in which the aim is to transform Posti into a modern, customer-oriented, high-quality service company.&#8221; Given the amount of existing infrastructure this seems like a really difficult way to signal change in the corporate structure but, hey, this is what keeps our industry in motion, so let&#8217;s roll with it.<\/p>\n<blockquote>Itella&#8217;s Vision 2020 and Posti&#8217;s new brand strategy created a clear framework for designing the identity. Posti&#8217;s identity should communicate two messages: Posti offers postal, e-commerce and logistics services, and that Posti&#8217;s role is to streamline the everyday life of consumers and the commercial transactions of businesses.<br \/><br \/>Posti&#8217;s new logo and identity were based on the new business priorities &mdash; parcels and logistics, while still keeping letters and magazines in mind, the bread and butter of postal business. Posti&#8217;s logo tells a story with its different parts: Posti is about logistics, Posti makes the flow of everyday life smoother, and Posti&#8217;s service comes from the heart.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/n2nolla.fi\/eng\/New+identity+for+Posti\/306\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">N2 Nolla project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/posti_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Posti by N2 Nolla\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The speed line in the logo describes how we make our customers&#8217; everyday lives run smoother with quick, easy-to-use services. The letter &#8220;i&#8221; in Posti represents a parcel.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.posti.fi\/english\/current\/2014\/20141216_itella_becomes_posti.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Posti press release<\/a><\/h3>\n<p>All photos below by <a href=\"http:\/\/trefilm.net\/project\/posti-brand-imagenery\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tre Film<\/a> (who have more images at the link).<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/posti_livery.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Posti by N2 Nolla\" \/>\n<figcaption>Livery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The previous logo was sleek, spare, and kind of mysterious &mdash; reminds me of Tatooine&#8217;s twin suns. The new logo is still spare but it&#8217;s definitely not sleek, nor mysterious, nor does it remind me of any <em>Star Wars<\/em> things. It does solve one mystery: We now know where UPS&#8217;s parcel ribbon went. It&#8217;s interesting how, despite the similar circumstances and business operations, UPS decided that a parcel was not the right way to identify its company and Posti decided that a parcel WAS the right way. Goes to show you there is no right or wrong answer in this business that a good &#8220;deck&#8221; can&#8217;t sell.<\/p>\n<p>As to the logo itself. It&#8217;s quite dry. I&#8217;m no parcel-tying expert but the knot feels very floppy, informal, and too literal. It&#8217;s just&hellip; a ribbon. There is nothing left to interpretation. The &#8220;speed line&#8221; is not very speedy and gives the wordmark an old school aesthetic, the wrong kind of old school. It sounds like I hate the logo. I don&#8217;t, really. It&#8217;s competently produced and it will work fine. It&#8217;s just fairly bland for such an important and visible operation and a step back in contrast to the existing identity.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/posti_mailbox.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Posti by N2 Nolla\" \/>\n<figcaption>Letterbox.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/posti_uniform_bike.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Posti by N2 Nolla\" \/>\n<figcaption>Uniform and bike.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/posti_truck.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Posti by N2 Nolla\" \/>\n<figcaption>Truck, uniform, and signage.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/posti_retail_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Posti by N2 Nolla\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/posti_retail_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Posti by N2 Nolla\" \/>\n<figcaption>Retail store.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/posti_sign.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Posti by N2 Nolla\" \/>\n<figcaption>Retail sign.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/posti_box_tape.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Posti by N2 Nolla\" \/>\n<figcaption>Tape and box.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">In application, we haven&#8217;t seen something like this in some time where there is nothing to the identity except the logo here, the logo there, the logo everywhere, either orange on white or white on orange. In this strictness and uniformity the logo becomes quite convincing simply by repetition (and the nice photographs). Overall, given the capital investment this is going to require it would have been great to get something more in tune with the more daring aesthetics of Finnish design.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Posti is the national mail carrier of Finland delivering almost 12 million items letters, magazines, newspapers and direct mail per day.
