The product comes in three variations &#8212; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.torsalonproducts.com\/shop\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fine\/thin, medium\/thick, and curly<\/a> &#8212; that are represented by three hand-drawn charcoal gestures by Salt Lake City, UT-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.7d8.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">7D8<\/a> and applied in a minimalist approach on the bottle with an extra large wordmark complemented by a thin serif. Along with the Terry-Richardson-like photography, this might verge too close to an American Apparel spin-off brand but there is more finesse involved here and all the typography is very well handled &#8212; I love how the &#8220;O&#8221; is a perfect circle and the &#8220;T&#8221; and &#8220;R&#8221; to its sides are nearly half its width. The different elements on the bottle, despite all being completely different come together effectively. Rinse and repeat. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.7d8.co\/work\/tor\/identity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Caff\u00e9 Pagani by Eskimo<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_caffepagani.jpg\" alt=\"Caff\u00e9 Pagani by Eskimo\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/caffepagani.ch\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Caff\u00e9 Pagani<\/a> is a roaster in Lugano, Switzerland, producing coffee for hotels, restaurants, and cafes that has been in business, and family owned, since 1949. I&#8217;m optimistically assuming that they are in the process of updating their website to match the identity and packaging designed by Saint-Petersburg, Russia-based <a href=\"http:\/\/eskimodesign.ru\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Eskimo<\/a>. Based on the circular movement of coffee during roasting, Eskimo has designed a type-on-circle logo (that also doubles as a &#8220;C&#8221; monogram) and a cylindrical package that support that concept in a beautifully produced system that spares no expense from business card to package. The brown, copper, and bare wood color palette is delicious and other than some overly spaced serif the typography is impeccable. <a href=\"http:\/\/eskimodesign.ru\/en\/projects\/caffe_pagani\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Eat Burger by Christopher Doyle &amp; Co.<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_eatburger.jpg\" alt=\"Eat Burger by Christopher Doyle &amp; Co.\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/eatburger.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Eat Burger<\/a> is, as the name suggests, a place where you eat burgers, located in Cronulla, a beach-side suburb in Sydney. The logo by Sydney-based <a href=\"http:\/\/christopherdoyle.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Christopher Doyle &amp; Co.<\/a> is almost infuriatingly simple (and I&#8217;m sure it will have its share of readability detractors) with the &#8220;EAT&#8221; name typeset clockwise, sort of, in a rough-around-the-edges sans serif. WYSIWYG and perhaps you even get less but I find the logo and its deadpan delivery pretty convincing. The burger liners with the repeating &#8220;EAT&#8221; are particularly awesome. To complement the logo and sans serif typography there is a hand-drawn layer that serves as a cool visual accent to get those beach vibes in place while the whole black and white color palette keeps an urban feel. I would eat that.  <a href=\"http:\/\/christopherdoyle.co\/selected-projects\/eat-burger\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"More sans serifs than you can shake a stick at this week, with work from Salt Lake City, Saint-Petersburg, and Sydney&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[597,1275,564,1297],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4839"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4839"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4839\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4839"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4839"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4839"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
