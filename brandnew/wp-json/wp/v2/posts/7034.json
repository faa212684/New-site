It employs a global team of 4,500 and generates approximately $612 million in net revenue. The company was previously known as Halyard Health, established in 2014 (although it had roots many decades prior as part of Kimberly-Clark), which was recently split into two companies: one, keeping the name Halyard Health (and acquired by another company) and focusing on the surgical and infection prevention business, and the other Avanos. The identity for the new company has been designed by the New York, NY, office of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.merchantcantos.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MerchantCantos<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>MerchantCantos developed the new name, which suggests a global sense of moving forward, that was inspired by the words: &#8220;innovation,&#8221; &#8220;advancing&#8221; and &#8220;vamonos.&#8221; The scope included a new brand platform, brand architecture, brand identity, art direction, packaging, product\/patient photography, corporate website and corporate films.<br \/><br \/>The new name and brand focuses on the idea of how <span style=\"font-family:arial\">\u2206<\/span>V<span style=\"font-family:arial\">\u2206<\/span>NOS puts &#8216;difference&#8217; at the heart of their business. The <span style=\"font-family:arial\">\u2206<\/span>V<span style=\"font-family:arial\">\u2206<\/span>NOS difference permeates everything <span style=\"font-family:arial\">\u2206<\/span>V<span style=\"font-family:arial\">\u2206<\/span>NOS does, from their innovative products, services and solutions, to how they work and collaborate.<br \/><br \/>We used 2 Delta symbols (a scientific symbol of difference) in place of the 2 &#8216;A&#8217;s&#8217; in the wordmark to represent the difference in <span style=\"font-family:arial\">\u2206<\/span>V<span style=\"font-family:arial\">\u2206<\/span>NOS&#8217; products and people, respectively. A circle represents their ambition to get patients, around the world, back to what matters. This is graphically summarized as <span style=\"font-family:arial\">\u2206<\/span> <span style=\"font-family:arial\">\u2206<\/span> O.<\/blockquote><h3>MerchantCantos provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/avanos_logo.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Avanos by MerchantCantos\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo, which remains in play for the other half of the original company, was\/is not bad, with a very decent wordmark and equally decent, although bewilderingly abstract, icon. What both new and old logos and names have in common is that slight tinge of evil-corporation-in-a-movie with medical-related cover-ups and other malfeasances. The old one more so in its name, the new one more so in its decoder-y logo. The new name is quite abstract and I guess it&#8217;s fine but I don&#8217;t get any of the associations referenced in the quote above. I do like the logo and how it replaces the &#8220;A&#8221;s with the delta symbols as a way of making the wordmark unique and ownable. It comes across effectively as science-y while remaining readable and looking like a significant company. It&#8217;s a difficult word to kern because &#8220;AVA&#8221; fits so well together but then the &#8220;NOS&#8221; part, no matter how hard one tries, feels separated. I would have pulled the &#8220;N&#8221; one nudge closer to the &#8220;A&#8221;.<\/p>\n<blockquote>These symbols are the foundation of the wordmark and are also embedded in brand level messaging and graphic patterns, giving the brand a recognizable image that transcends the logo. Merchant Cantos worked with URW++ to create the custom typeface: <span style=\"font-family:arial\">\u2206<\/span>V<span style=\"font-family:arial\">\u2206<\/span>NOS Sans, that replaces the A with <span style=\"font-family:arial\">\u2206<\/span> for setting headlines in multiple languages.<\/blockquote><h3>MerchantCantos provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/avanos_font.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Avanos by MerchantCantos\" \/>\n<figcaption>Custom font by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.urwtype.com\/en\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">URW++<\/a><\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The resulting brand language is clean, impactful and deliberate, with an overall aesthetic that is understated yet bold and confident.

The replacement of the &#8220;A&#8221; with the delta in the applications, especially in the website, manages to <em>not<\/em> be distracting or annoying and after a few clicks around it&#8217;s something you get used to and it builds a subtle visual language out of 1 single identity element, which is no small feat.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/avanos_packaging.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Avanos by MerchantCantos\" \/>\n<figcaption>Packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/avanos_notebook.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Avanos by MerchantCantos\" \/>\n<figcaption>Notebook.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\" style=\"padding-bottom: 67.25%;\"><video controls controlsList=\"nodownload\" poster=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/avanos_display.jpg\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/avanos_display.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Display ad.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">In contrast to our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/new_logo_and_identity_for_perfection_fresh_by_interbrand.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">last<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/new_logo_and_identity_for_tasmanias_west_coast_by_for_the_people.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">two<\/a> Reviews this week, this feels cold and corporate and almost as something that&#8217;s hard to like but I found this identity to be quite appropriate and visually interesting in its restrained range of graphic elements and cues.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 2018, Avanos is a medical technology company that designs, develops, and sells clinical medical devices for everything from chronic pain relief to digestive health, offering its brands and products around the world.
