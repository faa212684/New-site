The idea for ORA, positioned as a high-end luxury service and experience, was conceived by Kimberly Ross &#8212; who, before this, had established, as a teen, an online network of baby sitters with Type 1 diabetes (she was diagnosed at age 11) to work with kids with Type 1 diabetes and was later <a href=\"https:\/\/beyondtype1.org\/announcing-safesittings-now-a-program-of-beyond-type-1\/\" target==\"_blank\">acquired by Beyond Type 1<\/a> &#8212; during her time at Harvard Business School to earn an MBA in combination with experiencing first-hand positive benefits from acupuncture. With a retail location designed by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rockwellgroup.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rockwell Group<\/a>, ORA introduced a new identity designed by New York-based <a href=\"https:\/\/theworkingassembly.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Working Assembly<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>The icon contains an abstract of the Yin and Yang, representing the idea of two wholes coming together.

The icon above has a nice italic slant and while I don&#8217;t quite see an abstract Yin Yang I do get a nice sentiment of balance and almost like a re-channeling of energy with the 45-degree line acting as the redirecting mechanism, like an acupuncture needle. The wordmark repeats the same angle in the &#8220;R&#8221; and, with the two companion letters, is executed in a high-contrast sans serif style that yields an elegant and unique combination.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ora_spa_visual_language.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for ORA by The Working Assembly\" \/>\n<figcaption>Messaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ora_spa_pattern.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for ORA by The Working Assembly\" \/>\n<figcaption>Pattern.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ora_spa_business_cards.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for ORA by The Working Assembly\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ora_spa_note_cards.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for ORA by The Working Assembly\" \/>\n<figcaption>Postcards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ora_spa_menu.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for ORA by The Working Assembly\" \/>\n<figcaption>Menu.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ora_spa_website.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for ORA by The Working Assembly\" \/>\n<figcaption>Website.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ora_spa_coffee_cup_sleeve.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for ORA by The Working Assembly\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ora_spa_coffee_cup_sleeve_none.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for ORA by The Working Assembly\" \/>\n<figcaption>Cup with and without sleeve.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The applications introduce a floral pattern in a blue monotone approach reminiscent of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=blue+and+white+porcelain+plates&#038;lr=&#038;safe=active&#038;sxsrf=ALeKk00i0iU5G3NKQsomdh_OcuHEcaNXEw:1584526373373&#038;source=lnms&#038;tbm=isch&#038;sa=X&#038;ved=2ahUKEwiL4vzc5KPoAhUJOs0KHaKsDXsQ_AUoAnoECA4QBA&#038;biw=1409&#038;bih=866\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">blue and white porcelain<\/a> that alludes to the Chinese techniques used in the practice as well as the high-end, luxury vibe.
