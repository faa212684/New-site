(In part it buys me time to take a break from the daily posting!). But most importantly I do want to thank everyone that visits and comments and especially everyone that sends in the tips, you have no idea how useful it is to have such an engaged audience that can help us build the content for our site &mdash; since May of 2007, I can see that my inbox holds at least 2,700 e-mails with tips, so keep them coming. Brand New is now 3 years old and it&#8217;s been quite a thrill to see it grow the way it has. So, thanks again.
