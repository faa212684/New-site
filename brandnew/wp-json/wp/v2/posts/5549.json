Sido is probably best known for its line of <a href=\"http:\/\/samurai-armor-underwear.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Samurai armor underwear<\/a>, which you know you want. Recently, Sido introduced a new identity and packaging designed by Madrid, Spain- and Tokyo-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.erretres.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Erretres<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sido_hohtai_old_packaging.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Sido by Erretres\" \/>\n<figcaption>Samples of old packaging and logo in use.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The new visual identity of the brand had to reflect &#8220;fun in function&#8221;, that is, the union between a product&#8217;s functionality and its &#8220;cool&#8221;, contemporary and attractive image. Thus, we drew the logotype in a thick, elegant and contained, typography with an extended typeface that makes reference to the elasticity of the fabric. We accompanied it with a tagline to help highlight Sido&#8217;s main asset, Hohtai. We wrote Hohtai in Japanese characters, to tie the intrinsic quality of &#8220;made in Japan&#8221; to the logo. As a symbol for the mark, we gave special treatment to the letter &#8220;S&#8221;, from the company name. It adopts the curvilinear form of a textile fiber and creates a black and white pattern of lines, a metaphor for the breathability of the fabric.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.erretres.com\/portfolio\/sido\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Erretres project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sido_monogram.gif\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Sido by Erretres\" \/>\n<figcaption>Monogram.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sido_hohtai_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Sido by Erretres\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo wasn&#8217;t good. An abstract &#8220;S&#8221; that perhaps looked a little like steam, which is not a reference you want when thinking about underwear. The wordmark was decent but forgettable. The new logo revolves around a custom, sturdy, extended wordmark that looks great but maybe too industrial looking for underwear? This could almost pass for a line of concrete. Still, it&#8217;s a really nice bit of typography that helps support the sub-categories (more on that later). It also keeps an &#8220;S&#8221; monogram but this one is more abstract and starts to introduce the use of lines. When they rarely combine, the monogram takes over and the wordmark becomes secondary, so there is a nice flexibility to the two elements.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sido_stationery.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Sido by Erretres\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stationery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sido_typography.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Sido by Erretres\" \/>\n<figcaption>Typography.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sido_brand_book.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Sido by Erretres\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sido_brand_book_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Sido by Erretres\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sido_brand_book_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Sido by Erretres\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brand book.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sido_website.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Sido by Erretres\" \/>\n<figcaption>Online presence.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The corporate-side applications are clean, simple, and bold. And, yeah, not much more else to add on that.<\/p>\n<blockquote>In the strategy phase, we concluded the entire range of Sido products needed an architecture to distinguish each product category. We created a graphic system to visually organize the product portfolio. Each line needed to be perfectly differentiated from the others, while simultaneously respecting and coexisting with the identity of the parent brand.<br \/><br \/>To do so, we selected a letter to identify each product line and designed it in a way that makes reference to the fabric weave (also reminiscent of Japanese Zen gardens): &#8220;S&#8221;, from Sido, for the premium line; &#8220;H&#8221;, from Hohtai, for the basic line; &#8220;X&#8221;, from extreme, for the sports line; and &#8220;&amp;&#8221; for special collaborations. We also adapted the design depending on whether the product was for a man or a woman.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.erretres.com\/portfolio\/sido\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Erretres project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sido_categories.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Sido by Erretres\" \/>\n<figcaption>Product categories.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The identity starts to get interesting with the newly defined product categories, divided into Premium, Basics, Sports, and Collaborations, with each getting its own custom monogram, all with a visual emphasis on lines&#8230; from the multiple (in the &#8220;S&#8221; and &#8220;H&#8221;) to the single (in the &#8220;X&#8221; and &#8220;&amp;&#8221;).<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sido_category_s.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Sido by Erretres\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sido_category_h_woman.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Sido by Erretres\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sido_category_h_man.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Sido by Erretres\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sido_category_x.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Sido by Erretres\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sido_category_ampersand.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Sido by Erretres\" \/>\n<figcaption>Product category monograms.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sido_packaging_all.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Sido by Erretres\" \/>\n<figcaption>Packaging for each category.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The packaging then establishes a basic structure for all categories, with the wordmark on top and a big category monogram filling up the rest of the box.
