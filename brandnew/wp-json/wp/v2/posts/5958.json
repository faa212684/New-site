The identity by Brooklyn, NY-based designer, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lottanieminen.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lotta Nieminen<\/a> looks practically undesigned with a bare sans serif wordmark for the logo and a &#8220;New York&#8221; here and a &#8220;NY&#8221; there but it still looks stunning, as the few elements in play are all executed perfectly. The best feature of this identity, though, is the color palette, an unexpected combination of red, pink, and green (plus black and white) that are mixed and matched in some of the applications, all accented with gold foil stamping.  <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.lottanieminen.com\/graphicdesign\/cienne\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Lofoten Seaweed by by North<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_lofoten.jpg\" alt=\"Lofoten Seaweed by by North\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/lofotenseaweed.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lofoten Seaweed<\/a>, based in the eponymous archipelago in Norway, harvests seaweed from the arctic waters surrounding it to create unique gourmet products (that currently include Lofoten Umami, Ocean Truffle Salt, and Fresh Ocean Truffle). The packaging, designed by Bod\u00f8, Norway-based <a href=\"http:\/\/bynorth.no\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">by North<\/a> is a short, charming cylinder constructed in a seaweed-esque green paper accented by the company&#8217;s logo &#8212; which is fine (not loving it too much) &#8212; a halftone of the two women founders of the company, and some seaweed-based puns. The metallic tape, in different colors, is what <em>seals<\/em> the deal for me. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/bynorth.no\/projects\/lofoten-seaweed\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Miiro by IWANT design<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_miiro.jpg\" alt=\"Miiro by IWANT design\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.miiro.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Miiro<\/a> is a range of ice cream bars (or lollies in UK parlance) that are gluten-free, refined-sugar-free, and dairy-free but not fun-design-free.
