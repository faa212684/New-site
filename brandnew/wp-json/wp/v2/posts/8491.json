The following year, MCC laid down a Code of Laws, requiring the wickets to be pitched 22 yards apart and detailing how players could be given out. Its Laws were adopted throughout the game &#8211; and the Club today remains the custodian and arbiter of Laws relating to cricket around the world. There are now 18,000 Full and 5,000 Associate Members of MCC. These Members own the Ground and all of MCC&#8217;s assets (the most famous of which is the Ashes Urn), they govern the Club through various committees, and some 2,000 of them represent MCC on the field of play each year. MCC plays more matches than any other cricket club &#8211; around 480 per year against schools, universities and clubs in the UK, and between 20 and 30 fixtures annually as part of its overseas touring programme which aims to develop cricket abroad.&#8221;<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/\/mcc_suit.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Marylebone Cricket Club and Lord&amp;apos;s by The Clearing\" \/>\n<figcaption>A visual reference to the iconic &#8216;egg and bacon&#8217;
