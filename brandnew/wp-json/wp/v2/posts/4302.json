Helia &#8220;works with data to uncover patterns in human behaviour, mixing that with cultural understanding to inspire [their] creative ideas&#8221; which then &#8220;[inform their] architecture of digital communications platforms.&#8221; With eight offices around the world &mdash; including Chicago, New York, London and Shanghai &mdash; and 700 employees, that include 200 data scientists, Helia works with clients like Unilever, easyJet, IBM, Diageo and Sony PlayStation. The new identity was designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/ny.havasworldwide.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Havas Worldwide New York<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/helia_logo_concept.png\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Havas Helia by Havas Worldwide New York\" \/>\n<figcaption>Main logo-ish.

Nothing to get excited about and well within, I&#8217;m sure, the Havas brand guidelines. The new logo breaks away from the standards to establish its own identity. The core of the logo is a wordmark typeset in <a href=\"http:\/\/fontdeck.com\/font\/reader\/regular\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Reader Regular<\/a>, a neo-grotesque I had never heard of and, given the shape of that &#8220;a&#8221;, I am glad I hadn&#8217;t. The paisley-shaped counterspace irks me quite a bit and the little kick at the end of the tail does as well. So, not a lot of love for the wordmark itself, even with the custom round tittle that replaces the default rectangle from the original. The logo is also, sort of, a circle or parts of a circle or an insinuated circle. It&#8217;s almost a non-logo.<\/p>\n<blockquote>How do we unify data and creative to establish one universal language? Like the sun to our solar-system, people are at the core of both data and creative.<br \/><br \/>helia, meaning &#8216;of the sun&#8217; represents the sunlight and the variation of data. Inspired by the data analytics capabilities of helia, we developed an algorithm that creates unique data-informed expressions of the brand identity.<br \/><br \/>The visual language utilizes precise data inputs informed by the sunrise and sunset time cycles, as well as real-time weather and geographic information. As the final output, each piece, analog or digital, is marked with a unique data stamp.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/hellohelia.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Helia introduction microsite<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video controls><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/helia_case_study.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Case study presentation. Your best bet at understanding what&#8217;s going on.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>I very rarely post work for creative agencies &mdash; specially those in the advertising world because I&#8217;m not really a fan &mdash; and my initial reaction was to not cover this but I was distracted enough by the pretty gradients, the time-stamping of each produced item, and the overall moodiness of the resulting materials, to make a Review of it. To be honest, this still all comes across as an effort to get some attention online and perhaps win something at Cannes. The voiceover in the video above is so advertising-y it comes with its own account executive. Despite my apprehensions, it worked its charm on me.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/helia_logo_concept_hours.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Havas Helia by Havas Worldwide New York\" \/>\n<figcaption>Time of day gradients.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/helia_logo_concept_business_card_generator.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Havas Helia by Havas Worldwide New York\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business card generator elements.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/helia_business_cards.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Havas Helia by Havas Worldwide New York\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/helia_various_materials.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Havas Helia by Havas Worldwide New York\" \/>\n<figcaption>Various materials.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The printed materials have an undeniable appeal that makes Helia look edgy and creative to its clients and, more importantly, it serves as a showcase to represent that they can translate data into a visual manifestation. The bare-minimum layouts work best when paired with the circle gradients because when they are just against black there isn&#8217;t much to them.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/helia_tshirt.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Havas Helia by Havas Worldwide New York\" \/>\n<figcaption>T-shirt.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/helia_tote.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Havas Helia by Havas Worldwide New York\" \/>\n<figcaption>Tote bag.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/helia_balloon.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Havas Helia by Havas Worldwide New York\" \/>\n<figcaption>Ominous balloon.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">There is a decent flexibility to the system and the multiple elements that can be used for the different promo items and I&#8217;m sure will come in handy for client presentations &mdash; if I came into a conference room and there were black balloons with my consultant&#8217;s logo on them I would be enthused.
