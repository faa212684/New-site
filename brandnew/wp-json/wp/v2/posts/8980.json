With $36 million in seed and Series A funding &#8212; led by Redpoint Ventures and companies like One Medical and Warby Parker &#8212; Tend has invested in every touchpoint, from online scheduling, to staff training, to uniforms, to interior design, to its own fragrance that reduces anxiety. Led by their head of design, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/shoef\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Stephan Hoefnagels<\/a>, the design of the whole experience has brought in numerous collaborators across fashion, product design, and photography, with the identity designed by New York-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mythology.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mythology<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>The &#8220;e&#8221; in our wordmark is tilted to look like it&#8217;s smiling. Our typefaces, Nantes and Founders Grotesk, balance warmth with elegance. And our linear key lines resemble a doctor&#8217;s script to evoke authority and earn trust.<br \/><br \/>Our color palette is friendly and approachable. Warm, muted colors create a sense of calm.

There isn&#8217;t much to philosophize about the logo: it&#8217;s a straight-up wordmark in lowercase in a very nice serif. It&#8217;s not concept- or industry-driven, it&#8217;s simply very pleasant to look at, which I guess is a concept in itself. This could easily be the logo for a lifestyle publication or artisanal shampoo, which may sound like a putdown but it&#8217;s not meant to be&#8230; I think Tend knows who its audience is &#8212; image- and experience-minded New Yorkers &#8212; and is catering well to it.<\/p>\n<blockquote>We have a unique pattern inspired by brushing, swishing, and swirling.

The grey scrubs have a lovely texture and provide a neutral backdrop for the green pattern accents of the scarfs and liners. Or, as is the case above, the uniform can be a giant accent on its own with a full-on pattern jumper.<\/p>\n<blockquote>Our architectural and interior design elements are designed to ease anxiety. Green tiles with a winding, floss-like pattern. Walles with a toothpaste-like texture. A custom fragrance, &#8220;Bergamist,&#8221; calms and refreshes. The Brushery is an entirely new concept. It&#8217;s a space just for freshening up, with our pattern on the walls and blue-green sinks and shelves that play off of it.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/93146323\/Tend-Brand-Identity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tend_exterior.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Tend by Mythology\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sample exterior.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tend_lobby.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Tend by Mythology\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sample lobby.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tend_studio.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Tend by Mythology\" \/>\n<figcaption>The &#8220;suite&#8221;.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tend_bathroom_a.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Tend by Mythology\" \/>\n<figcaption>The &#8220;Brushery&#8221;, a space for freshening up.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The interiors get a little pretentious for my taste &#8212; I&#8217;ll admit that my taste can sometimes be too frugal for my own good &#8212; but they are definitely attractive, pleasant, and no doubt come across as an elevated experience from your everyday dentist.
