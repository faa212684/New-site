Recently, the organization introduced a new identity designed by local firm <a href=\"https:\/\/matchstic.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Matchstic<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>We were careful to preserve the visual expressions that have built equity in the community for over 50 years. The logotype was updated ever so slightly to make it tighter and more legible. While the heart remains a big part of the brand, we also created a fun and flexible system around it&#8211;one that helps it beat a little louder and bring warm and fuzzies to animal lovers across the city.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/matchstic.com\/work\/atlanta-humane-society\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Matchstic project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video controls controlsList=\"nodownload\" loop poster=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/atlanta_humane_society_logo_evolution.png\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/atlanta_humane_society_logo_evolution.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo evolution.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/atlanta_humane_society_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Atlanta Humane Society by Matchstic\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>There isn&#8217;t much to talk about the logo as it&#8217;s a very straightforward evolution that simply and literally tightens the previous version. I am sure there was an impetus to create a new logo and I am sure it could have been awesome but this is a strong, simple logo with equity in the community and it seems like a sensible thing to do to maintain it and extend its life expectancy. Making the heart smaller makes a significant difference in it becoming more of a glyph embedded within the other letters as opposed to a large heart wedged in there. Also, it&#8217;s been a long time since Avant Garde Gothic was the center of attention and it feels good, in a 1970s awesome-typography kind of good.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/atlanta_humane_society_various_applications.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Atlanta Humane Society by Matchstic\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/atlanta_humane_society_various_applications_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Atlanta Humane Society by Matchstic\" \/>\n<figcaption>Various applications.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/atlanta_humane_society_magazine_covers.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Atlanta Humane Society by Matchstic\" \/>\n<figcaption>Magazine covers.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/atlanta_humane_society_annual_report_covers.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Atlanta Humane Society by Matchstic\" \/>\n<figcaption>Annual report covers.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The applications are really great, with the identity doubling down on the use of lowercase Avant Garde Gothic, working it for all its worth in its bold weight and doing a great job in creating hierarchy through font size changes. The selected companion serif is lovely and complements Avant Garde really well &#8212; grateful that it&#8217;s not another bold spiky serif. Keeping the color palette to red, black, and white maintains consistency in a simple way and the pet photography is very well curated. I also like how the logo can expand into a single line lock-up applied on the bottom of the layouts.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/atlanta_humane_society_adoption_guide.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Atlanta Humane Society by Matchstic\" \/>\n<figcaption>Adoption guide.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\" style=\"padding-bottom: 66.25%;\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/atlanta_humane_society_posters.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Posters.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\" style=\"padding-bottom: 66.25%;\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/atlanta_humane_society_website.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Website.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>Inspired by the curiosity and playfulness of the animals, Atlanta Humane Society&#8217;s tried and true Avant Garde Gothic became active and full of typographic energy.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/matchstic.com\/work\/atlanta-humane-society\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Matchstic project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/atlanta_humane_society_graphic_language.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Atlanta Humane Society by Matchstic\" \/>\n<figcaption>Playful graphic language.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/atlanta_humane_society_billboard.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Atlanta Humane Society by Matchstic\" \/>\n<figcaption>Billboard.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/atlanta_humane_society_tote.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Atlanta Humane Society by Matchstic\" \/>\n<figcaption>Tote.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/atlanta_humane_society_mugs.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Atlanta Humane Society by Matchstic\" \/>\n<figcaption>Mugs.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/atlanta_humane_society_volunteer_tshirt.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Atlanta Humane Society by Matchstic\" \/>\n<figcaption>T-shirt.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>As an additional expression, Avant Garde can be playfully dumped unto a layout and letting the letterforms pile on and support each other, sometimes defying typographic gravity.
