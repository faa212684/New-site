With 600 employees across the Nordic region,  the company counts with half a million customers. Recently, Nordnet introduced a new identity.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>Nordnet is about growth, helping people grow financially and making investments accesible. It&#8217;s easy, not complicated. Our symbol for growth is just as easy. It resembles a line graph curve forming the letter &#8220;N&#8221;, short for &#8220;Nordnet&#8221;.<br \/><br \/>Our symbol is honest, simple and with a built-in explanation of our business. It goes well with our wordmark, yet it is strong as a single element with an expression that will stand the test of time.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/brand.nordnet.se\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nordnet brand microsite<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nordnet_lockup.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Nordnet\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nordnet_alternate_lockup.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Nordnet\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo lock-ups.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>Our colour palette is wide for functionality, differentiation, recognition and contrast. The base is neutral and simple, consisting of white, grays and black to ensure a qualitative expression. Vibrant colours help us to be versatile and to create excitement, to highlight information and contrast the neutral base.<br \/><br \/>Our colours refer to creativity and energy and give us the opportunity to be functional, but also to communicate with our target groups and to adjust to different contexts and needs.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/brand.nordnet.se\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nordnet brand microsite<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nordnet_logo_colors.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Nordnet\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo color variations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo was relatively okay with an easily discernible &#8220;N&#8221; disguised as a line chart &#8212; don&#8217;t know what the dot was for though &#8212; and a somewhat horsey, all lowercase wordmark that was maybe 5pt too big for the monogram. It was fine but somewhat generic. The new logo is a more confident (even a little more aggressive) presentation for the bank with a bold and striking &#8220;N&#8221; monogram that&#8217;s more graphically engaging but less conceptually tied to the organization. It&#8217;s supposedly a line graph just like the old one but, well, it&#8217;s not. It could potentially be rationalized as a <em>bar<\/em> graph but even that&#8217;s not quite right. I would have more gladly accepted &#8220;We wanted a more heavy metal logo, and this is what we came up with&#8221;. I like the monogram and I like the lock-up where it&#8217;s huge over the wordmark &#8212; that alignment is heavy metal. The wordmark is fine I guess. Nothing too exciting but a decent complement and secondary player.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nordnet_identity_elements.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Nordnet\" \/>\n<figcaption>Identity elements.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The graphic world of Nordnet is based on basic geometric shapes: the line, the rectangle, the square and the circle &#8211; as well as arrows. These elements are the most used in the world of finance and infographics, which is where our inspiration derives.<br \/><br \/>The geometric shapes are  timeless and provides us with endless variations and areas of use. Keeping the graphics this simple throughout the entire brand experience creates a holistic expression, from infographics to dynamic animated communication.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/brand.nordnet.se\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nordnet brand microsite<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nordnet_graphical.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Nordnet\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nordnet_colors.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Nordnet\" \/>\n<figcaption>Colors and graphics.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nordnet_font.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Nordnet\" \/>\n<figcaption>Custom type family.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nordnet_applications.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Nordnet\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sample layouts.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video controls controlsList=\"nodownload\" poster=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nordnet_video.jpg\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nordnet_video.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>New identity video.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>There aren&#8217;t any real applications to see unfortunately as I think there is some good potential with the identity elements shown. It maybe leans too heavily towards a sterile minimalist aesthetic without offering something distinctive in terms of design and without offering a human connection in terms of its presentation to customers. The focus on presenting the financial data clearly and easily makes this look like a Nutrition Facts label. There is a strong foundation here that perhaps needs to be softened and given a slightly more relatable feel, especially for a digital-only bank that may already feel distant enough.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1996, Nordnet is a digital bank for savings and investments with business in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Finland, that offers various financial services including online investing in shares and funds, unsecured personal loans and margin lending with securities&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,37,26],"tags":[785,441,108,40,1409],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6856"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=6856"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6856\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=6856"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=6856"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=6856"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
