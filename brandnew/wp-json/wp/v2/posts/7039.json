Taking cues from the architectural details &#8212; like rounded-corner windows and the long courtyard-like space &#8212; local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.studiosouth.co.nz\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">South<\/a> has designed a crisp, minimalist &#8220;Q&#8221; logo and a stunning set of marketing materials. The monogram, used large in the layouts and neatly tucked into the bottom right corners where the tail of the &#8220;Q&#8221; nestles naturally, is accompanied by small and elegant typography throughout and delivered in a soft, creamy, and peachy color palette. What this identity says is that whatever the rental price is for space in this building will be worth it. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.studiosouth.co.nz\/projects\/queen\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Bluecorp by As\u00eds<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_bluecorp.jpg\" alt=\"Bluecorp by As\u00eds\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bluecorp.com.ar\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bluecorp<\/a> is a software company in Argentina whose main product is geared to professionals dedicated to retirement and pensions accounting. Neither their website nor social media reflects the new identity but the project page and the applications look legit (as opposed to the infuriating amount of fake stuff on Behance presented as real stuff, but I digress). Designed by Buenos Aires-based <a href=\"http:\/\/weareasis.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">As\u00eds<\/a>, the identity is dead-simple starting with an icon that makes me, in this case, blue with jealousy: an abstract &#8220;b&#8221; hidden inside a file icon. So good. Paired with a strong sans serif, the logo is deployed without fuss on elegant, corporate-looking materials. Strong icon, tight grid, appropriate color palette. File it. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/71553467\/Bluecorp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Molo by Estudio yeye<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_molo.jpg\" alt=\"Molo by Estudio yeye\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">And now for something completely different: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/MoloPokeSpot\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Molo<\/a> is a poke (of the Hawaiian kind) restaurant in Mexico City and its identity, designed by local firm <a href=\"https:\/\/yeye.design\/Molo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Estudio yeye<\/a>, follows very few rules and abides by few expectations of what a restaurant looks like. Other than being weird, there is not much that ties any of the elements together, from the crooked and wobbly logo to the weird illustrations to the stroked typography to any of the layouts. I wouldn&#8217;t even say this comes together when seen collectively but I still deeply enjoy how wacky and disparate and nonsensical it all is. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/yeye.design\/Molo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"We start off with a couple of mild-mannered projects and end with a doozy this week, with work from Auckland, Buenos Aires, and Mexico City&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[65,11,85,26,44],"tags":[225,1629,261,424],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7039"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=7039"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7039\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=7039"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=7039"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=7039"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
