They have built tunnels, bridges, pipelines, rail lines, buildings small and large, hospitals, metro stations, and more. Recently, John Holland introduced a new identity designed by Sydney-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.frostcollective.com.au\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Frost* Design<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>The new identity retains a clear link to John Holland&#8217;s heritage in terms of retaining the name and the iconic red colouring. At the centre of the logo, made from the lettering itself, is a person.<br \/><br \/>&#8220;Putting a person at the very heart of our brand mark shows our focus on people-centred solutions. Frost Design worked with us to create a shift that injects more meaning into our identity, while still making us easy to recognise,&#8221; says Barr.<br \/><br \/>Frost* Design carried the human element across to other visual elements, including icons and illustrations that are expressive and unexpected along with a rich, warm and authentic photography style. The brand language has also changed to better reflect how John Holland transforms lives.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.frostcollective.com.au\/projects\/transforming-lives-john-holland\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Frost* Design project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/john_holland_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for John Holland by Frost* Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/john_holland_concept.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for John Holland by Frost* Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icon with images.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo looked like something you would find at Radio Shack in the 1980s &#8212; in part because it used the mother of all 1980s fonts, <a href=\"https:\/\/gizmodo.com\/why-youve-never-heard-of-this-typeface-that-defined-the-1602584135\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Motter Textura<\/a> &#8212; and while there was nothing wrong with it, it totally felt out of another lifetime. The new logo updates to today&#8217;s standard of a geometric sans but cleverly and masterfully finds and places an abstract person in between the two lines of text. The person is not hard to see but it&#8217;s also not fully given away at first glance, requiring a quick double take to notice it. The execution is spot on with a monospace structure that doesn&#8217;t feel stiff or computer-y and that takes advantage of the geometric shapes to make each character fill in the full width of each space. The icon works great on its own and serves as a playful element when placed between contrasting photographs.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/john_holland_business_cards.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for John Holland by Frost* Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/john_holland_manual_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for John Holland by Frost* Design\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/john_holland_manual_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for John Holland by Frost* Design\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/john_holland_manual_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for John Holland by Frost* Design\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/john_holland_manual_04.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for John Holland by Frost* Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brand manual.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/john_holland_posters.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for John Holland by Frost* Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Posters.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/john_holland_ads.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for John Holland by Frost* Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Ads.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The applications are fairly straightforward but the bold, red typography has a strong impact and the up and down arrow that frame the headlines make for a good secondary element that helps tie the applications together, along with warmer copywriting and photography.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/john_holland_journals.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for John Holland by Frost* Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Notebooks.
