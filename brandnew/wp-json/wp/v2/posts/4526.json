An independent practitioner&#8217;s organisation founded in 1957 by members, for members. The organisation acts collectively with one voice, to drive and engage opinion around design. Our purpose is to make everyday life easier for the individual designer, and to highlight the power of design as a builder of cultural and economic value. We are excited to see the definition of design expand organically and are now embarking on a big change to better represent and support our members. We are moving away from the traditional model of the degree-based, national members-only organisation and re-launching ourselves as an open, international platform for designers affiliated with Sweden from across the world. To reflect this change of perspective we are making major changes, some of the first ones being renaming the organisation from The Swedish Association of Designers (Sveriges Designer) to simply Design Sweden, a new identity &#8211; and introducing a free membership.&#8221;<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/design_sweden_logo.png\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Design Sweden by Parasol and Letters from Sweden\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detaiol<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/design_sweden_logo_tagline.png\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Design Sweden by Parasol and Letters from Sweden\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo with tagline.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/design_sweden_logo_variations.png\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Design Sweden by Parasol and Letters from Sweden\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo variations and reductions.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/design_sweden_font.png\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Design Sweden by Parasol and Letters from Sweden\" \/>\n<figcaption>Custom type family, DS Mikro, by Letters from Sweden.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/design_sweden_brochure.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Design Sweden by Parasol and Letters from Sweden\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/design_sweden_brochure_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Design Sweden by Parasol and Letters from Sweden\" \/>\n<figcaption>Printed materials.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/design_sweden_onsite.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Design Sweden by Parasol and Letters from Sweden\" \/>\n<figcaption>In-situ.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"&quot;Design Sweden is an organisation dedicated to Sweden&apos;s designers.
