It has endured more than five years of delays, scrutiny and political and sentimental maneuvering. Not surprisingly, of course, as it is a subject that requires tact and patience. The site on the southern tip of Manhattan remains, for lack of a better description, in ruins, and the expectation of what the site will be, only adds to the eagerness of seeing it completed. As a way to emphasize the importance of the memorial as a national endeavor the World Trade Center Memorial Foundation recently changed its name to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.national911memorial.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum at the World Trade Center<\/a>. Long, certainly, but with pinpoint accuracy in giving it a larger sense of relevance, beyond New York. The identity, &#8220;a creative interpretation of the pools of the Memorial itself [that] represent the strength and the ephemeral quality of our memories&#8221; has been designed by New York-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.numberseventeen.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Number Seventeen<\/a>. [<a href=\"hhttps:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/national9-11_detail.gif\" onclick=\"window.open('https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/national9-11_detail.gif','popup','width=420,height=420,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false\">Bigger view here<\/a>]. The design is understated, with its subtle depiction of the tower footprints, both as a reminder of what once stood there and as a representation of the water that now flows through them; elegant, in its soft colors and centered arrangement; and modern, in its typographic selection, reminding us that this happened in the 21st Century. As a reflection of what design can do to convey meaning and sentiment, this identity stands strong as a complementary voice to the powerful echo of the design of the memorial.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,63,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/525"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=525"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/525\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=525"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=525"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=525"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
