With two campuses &#8212; one in Vilnius, Lithuania&#8217;s capital, and the other in the port city of Klaip\u0117da &#8212; the university counts with 2,400 students and offers study programs in the areas of informatics, health, arts, business and public administration, law, and social sciences. Earlier this year, SMK introduced a new identity designed by Vilnius-based <a href=\"http:\/\/andstudio.lt\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Andstudio<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>Our biggest inspiration were SMK people. Every SMK student is a unique individual, all together they are forming a vibrant, dynamic and active community. To represent every individual we created more than 200 pictograms. Together they become a graphic system that overcomes any limitations of a traditional logo and helps to recognize the brand from a distinctive set of different visual elements.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/andstudio.lt\/work\/smk-university-of-applied-social-sciences\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Andstudio project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/smk_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for SMK by Andstudio\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo was fairly decent, cleverly balancing the &#8220;S&#8221; with an abstracted &#8220;K&#8221; to maintain weight symmetry around the &#8220;M&#8221; and place an open book underneath aligning neatly with all the letters. The new logo is a contemporary evolution that maintains the same construction sans the book, which I kind of would have to liked to see evolved in the same style. The &#8220;K&#8221; is a little harder to decipher in the new logo but graphically it&#8217;s more striking. The full name underneath could use some extra leading to let it breath a little.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/smk_logo_with_icons.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for SMK by Andstudio\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo composition sample.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>If you miss the book graphic like me, the logo is most often accompanied by a wide range of icons arranged in a grid and these become the centerpiece of the identity.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/smk_icons.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for SMK by Andstudio\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icons for each study program.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The different study programs get their own set of icons, some are literal, some are metaphorical, some are head-scratchers (but that&#8217;s fine). Apart from these, there are a few dozen others to convey your mood, personality, and habits.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/smk_icons.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for SMK by Andstudio\" \/>\n<figcaption>A few icons, bigger.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>[Through an] app SMK students can create their own unique symbol. 4 easy steps of games and tests and the application generates a personal logotype.

I don&#8217;t know if the icons could have been more cohesive somehow? Or perhaps it&#8217;s the lack of cohesiveness that makes it work? Or even further, these ARE cohesive? Nonetheless, the intention is good and, in application, they clearly help establish a distinctive personality.<\/p>\n<blockquote>The whole identity system is based on University&#8217;s mission, core values, modern approach and open-mindedness. It also becomes a symbol of constant change, where every person has the possibility to create his own unique SMK visual identity.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/andstudio.lt\/work\/smk-university-of-applied-social-sciences\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Andstudio project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/smk_stationery.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for SMK by Andstudio\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stationery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/smk_various.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for SMK by Andstudio\" \/>\n<figcaption>Various materials.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/smk_program.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for SMK by Andstudio\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/smk_program_spreads.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for SMK by Andstudio\" \/>\n<figcaption>Program.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>At a glance, or for a student seeing this for the first time without the context of what the icons mean, the design can feel random or gratuitous and some of the icons &#8212; like the orange with a leaf &#8212; make you question what in the world this is all about. But at the same time, the design helps SMK look very different from other educational institutions in an attractive, energetic, and youthful way.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/282674434?title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"360\" height=\"203\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Website.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/smk_exhibit_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for SMK by Andstudio\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/smk_exhibit_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for SMK by Andstudio\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/smk_exhibit_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for SMK by Andstudio\" \/>\n<figcaption>Exhibitor booth.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>I would totally flock to their exhibitor space at what looks like a college fair.
