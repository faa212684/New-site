As one of the original ten teams that started the league in 1996, it has not changed its logo since its inception and Shultz thinks it&#8217;s time. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/group.php?gid=37522193198\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">He has started a Facebook group with all the details<\/a>. For those of you that prefer not to go into Facebook I have copied some of the images and text below. So, time for a change in crew?<\/div><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/inbrief_columbus_crew_02.gif\" alt=\"Columbus Crew, Before and After Logo\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Before and proposed logo.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote>After The Crew brought the MLS Cup to Columbus in &#8217;08, I took a long look at how our team and city will be perceived in the months and seasons to come. We have the best team, coaches, fans, and facilities in the league&#8230; but we&#8217;re running an emblem that&#8217;s 12 years old and in need of some rejuvenation.<br \/><br \/>So, I propose we revamp the Columbus Crew brand to go with our revamped spirit. The logo you see on this page was created by me as a possible solution. Is it the only solution? No but I think it&#8217;s a good start.<br \/><br \/>The purpose of this group is to catch the attention of Crew management to let them know the movement is out there. It&#8217;s not a chastising of our current logo&#8230; I appreciate the passion and attachment people feel for the old look. This is simply a refresh. You&#8217;ll notice that, in concept, this new logo is almost identical: a shield, featuring 3 &#8220;crew&#8221; members looking sternly onward. What&#8217;s been changed is simply our style of expression. The fonts changed. The illustration is simplified. The appearance is revamped. But the heart is the same.<\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/inbrief_columbus_crew_03.gif\" alt=\"Columbus Crew Logo\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/inbrief_columbus_crew_01.gif\" alt=\"Columbus Crew Logo\" \/><\/p>\n<blockquote>The intent of this redesign is to SIMPLIFY, STREAMLINE, and STYLIZE.<br \/><br \/>SIMPLIFY: Get rid of the fussy details in the old dudes and present a clean, iconic illustration for the new.<br \/><br \/>STREAMLINE: Where sloppiness once was is now a crisp collection of elements working together. Precise outlines and mathematical spacing present the Crew as an uncompromising bunch.<br \/><br \/>STYLIZE: The Crew should be tough and formidable. Hence the hard angles, structured lettering, and geometric layout.<\/blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jarrodbeglinger.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jarrod Beglinger<\/a> for the tip.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[26,87],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/739"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=739"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/739\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=739"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=739"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=739"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
