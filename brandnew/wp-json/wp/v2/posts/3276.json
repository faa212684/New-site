Featuring commissioned aphorisms from artist Agatha Gothe-Snape, the identity is very verbose but the shift in filled-in type and stroked-type provides enough change to keep it lively, along with a simple color palette. The winning concept here was cutting that 8 in half, which also looks like two &#8220;B&#8221;s back to back (for Berlin Biennale), and the bespoke condensed typeface by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.radimpesko.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Radim Pesko<\/a>. <a href=\"http:\/\/zakgroup.co.uk\/projects\/view\/berlin_biennale_art_direction\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Fazer Caf&eacute; by Kokoro &amp; Moi<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_fazercafe.jpg\" alt=\"Fazer Caf&eacute; by Kokoro &amp; Moi\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">A staple of Helsinki since 1891, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fazer.fi\/kahvilat-ja-leipomot\/kahvilat--ravintolat\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fazer Caf&eacute;<\/a> has opened various locations in recent years with an identity by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kokoromoi.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kokoro &amp; Moi<\/a> that features a couple of custom fonts &mdash; a sans and a chisel &mdash; based on the signage of the original location. Set in blue, yellow, and gold, the letterforms occupy everything from coffee cups to shopping bags to walls. It&#8217;s simple, elegant, and bold and you can spell CAF&Eacute; with cups, so that&#8217;s awesome. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kokoromoi.com\/work\/fazer-cafe\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project here<\/strong><\/a><\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">BNT Studio by Emanuel Cohen<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_bnt.jpg\" alt=\"BNT Studio by Emanuel Cohen\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">At first, I wasn&#8217;t convinced by the logo for <a href=\"http:\/\/bntstudio.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BNT Studio<\/a>, a design-y product distributor in Canada, designed by Montreal, Quebec-based <a href=\"http:\/\/26lettres.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Emanuel Cohen<\/a> but the more I saw it repeated in the identity, taking up large swaths of space yet feeling light and airy, the more I liked it. It&#8217;s a simple and attractive monogram that despite being asymmetrical with a circle on the left of the &#8220;N&#8221; and a tiny horizontal line on the right feels perfectly in balance. The black, warm grays, and salmon color palette is super nice as well. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/BNT-STUDIO\/14957035\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Peculiar sans serifs are the common thread this week on Friday Likes with work from London, Helsinki, and Montreal&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[880,837,40],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3276"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3276"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3276\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3276"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3276"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3276"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
