While Facebook and Twitter get all the social media recognition and Google Books all the information hoarding props, Scribd is a vibrant repository &mdash; 10 million documents published so far &mdash; of user-generated content that makes books, magazine articles, white papers, presentations, and more, available in a painless format that is easy for users to share and for readers to access. I became enamored with Scribd when we were working on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/1592534473?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=uc-20&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=1592534473\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Graphic Design, Referenced<\/a> as we were able to find plenty of articles and essays that otherwise would have been a pain in the behind to acquire. The service isn&#8217;t perfect, of course, as it&#8217;s prone to illegal uploads but in its short three years, it has grown tremendously &mdash; the time for a redesign seems appropriate.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/scribd_various.gif\" alt=\"Scribd\" \/><\/p>\n<p>I happened to like the old logo quite a bit, at least the icon with that blank piece of paper sitting in the rainbowish gradient, but if it had a fault is that it looked too much like all of Google&#8217;s multicolored logos and was probably easily mistaken for another of its properties. The new logo is somewhat of a downgrade in that you could write anything in that <a href=\"http:\/\/www.typography.com\/fonts\/font_overview.php?productLineID=100033\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Archer<\/a>esque typeface and call it your own, so it lacks any sense of ownership from Scribd. The wordmark starts out well, with a pretty &#8220;S&#8221; but it gets awkward from there on, with the clunky slab serifs. It also has a bit of that Web 2.0 patina that we had just begun to see disappear. However, the new wordmark is part of a complete overhaul of the Scribd web site and, in that regard, it works very well, establishing a more formal and serious look, with the brown and blue palette serving as a great way to identify Scribd.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/scribd_collage.gif\" alt=\"Scribd\" \/><\/p>\n<p><object width=\"575\" height=\"431\"><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" \/><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" \/><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=9404957&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=00ADEF&amp;fullscreen=1\" \/><embed src=\"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=9404957&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=00ADEF&amp;fullscreen=1\" type=\"application\/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" width=\"575\" height=\"431\"><\/embed><\/object><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">A Visual Code History of Scribd<\/a> from <a href=\"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/user215661\">James Yu<\/a> on <a href=\"http:\/\/vimeo.com\">Vimeo<\/a>. &#8220;Each dot is a file being touched.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hklmgroup.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Andre Redelinghuys<\/a> for the tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_100318_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_100318_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_100318_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_100318_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,82,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1055"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1055"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1055\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1055"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1055"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1055"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
