Needles to say he sounds like a fun guy. (Sorry). Designed by London-based <a href=\"http:\/\/fieldworkfacility.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fieldwork Facility<\/a>, Mark&#8217;s logo is, bar none, the best logo for a forensic botanist ever, in the world. Not only because it&#8217;s probably the only one but because it&#8217;s actually awesome, with a crumbling dry leaf doubling as an eye. It&#8217;s smart, clever, and visually stunning. Paired with an elegant but friendly serif, the logo and other applications have an academic feel but with a hint of X-Files mystery. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/fieldworkfacility.com\/projects\/forensic-botany\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Halo Brewery by Underline Studio<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_halo.jpg\" alt=\"Halo Brewery by Underline Studio\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.halobrewery.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Halo Brewery<\/a> is a small brewery, tasting room, and bottle shop in Toronto, Canada, offering beers with names like &#8220;Event Horizon&#8221;, &#8220;Tokyo Rose&#8221;, and &#8220;RGBee&#8221;. Their packaging, designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/underlinestudio.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Underline Studio<\/a>, builds on that sensibility with a range of abstract geometric drawings that have nothing to do with beer but that look damn fantastic as labels on cans and bottles all unified through a minimal grid and use of typography. The compositions are groovy and colorful, perhaps a bit irritating for anyone that has had it with microbreweries and their too-cool-for-school approaches but I haven&#8217;t had it yet. The extra condensed, upwards rising &#8220;HALO&#8221; logo is nice too. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/underlinestudio.com\/halo-brewery-2\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Alpine Modern by Cast Iron Design<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_alpine_modern.jpg\" alt=\"Alpine Modern by Cast Iron Design\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.alpinemodern.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Alpine Modern<\/a>, in Boulder, CO, is a shop, cafe, and magazine all in one, bringing together modern design, the mountains, and architecture into one lifestyle brand. Designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/castirondesign.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cast Iron Design<\/a> this isn&#8217;t your usual glitzy Friday Like but rather a simple, functional, and attractive brand evolution with some really nice production finishes and a lot of attention to detail from signage to packaging. The revised &#8220;AM&#8221; monogram &#8212; you can see the original at the link &#8212; makes for a great graphic device to build this identity around. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/castirondesign.com\/work\/alpine-modern\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"A fun range of projects this week, covering a good variety of clients and styles, with work from London, Toronto, and Boulder&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[51,11,86,26],"tags":[184,1524,872],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6152"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=6152"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6152\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=6152"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=6152"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=6152"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
