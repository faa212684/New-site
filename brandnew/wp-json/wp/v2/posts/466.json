Also to be noted, is the integration of the &#8220;e&#8221; into the actual name instead of treating it as an icon of sorts. I am not sure if the slight change in color is an issue with the reproduction in the PDF or an actual adjustment, but the type does seem to have gained weight and character if not great personality (or the treatment from the best &#8220;plastics&#8221; guys out there). As a minor detail the &reg; seems to have moved inside the logo, instead of hanging out on the left. <\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/enterprise_detail_02.gif\"\/><\/p>\n<p>All in all it does feel bolder, more iconic than the previous rendition.
