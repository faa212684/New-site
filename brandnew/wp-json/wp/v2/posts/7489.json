He suggested it at First Round in Atlanta where he was one of the speakers. We laughed then forgot about it. Last Monday, March 25, despite a hundred other things to do, was only when we decided to make the idea happen, coming up with the name, logo, speakers (who all agreed to participate), functioning website, and promo graphics. It has been about three years since we made a proper April Fools, so hopefully you enjoyed it.<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;\u00a0&#8212;\u00a0&#8212;\u00a0&#8212;\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>We are excited to announce a new live event taking place on September 16, 2019, in New York: <a href=\"https:\/\/underconsideration.com\/ToteCon\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ToteCon<\/a>, a one-day conference devoted to the ideation, design, and full-bleed rendering of tote bags for corporate and brand identity projects. 12 designers from around the world will share their best practices for designing effective and memorable tote bags.<\/p>\n<p>Seating is limited to 605 at The Auditorium in The New School.
