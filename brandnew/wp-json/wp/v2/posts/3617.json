Brands, is &#8220;the world&#8217;s largest pizza company&#8221; &mdash; according to their own description which I don&#8217;t doubt but I put in quotes to clarify it wasn&#8217;t my statement &mdash; with $12 billion in global sales and more than 15,000 restaurants in 93 countries worldwide, employing over 160,000 people. Their pizza? It&#8217;s fine for mainstream global standards of pizza and they did give us cheese-stuffed crust because all that cheese simply wasn&#8217;t enough. Yesterday, Pizza Hut introduced a new menu &mdash; billed as &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/order.pizzahut.com\/flavorofnow\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Flavor of Now<\/a>&#8221; &mdash; that represents their biggest evolution yet, introducing ten new crust flavors like Honey Sriracha, Salted Pretzel, and Ginger Boom Boom; new &#8220;drizzles&#8221; and sauces; and premium ingredients  like Salami, Fresh Spinach and Peruvian Cherry Peppers. (Spinach! Premium?). Along with the new menu, Pizza Hut also introduced a revision to its logo, designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.deutschinc.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Deutsch LA<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>Pizza Hut will look different, too, as the iconic red roof logo has been contemporized, along with delivery  boxes, cups and even employee uniforms. All of these changes will be heralded in a national advertising campaign celebrating the &#8220;Flavor of Now.&#8221;<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.pizzahutnewsroom.com\/media\/PizzaHut_FlavorOfNow_Release_111014.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pizza Hut press release<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pizza_hut_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Pizza Hut by Deutsch LA\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The main elements of the logo &mdash; the iconic hut roof and script wordmark &mdash; remain in place but are now placed inside a smear of tomato sauce. (Animation that demonstrates this can be found at the end of the last video later in the post). It&#8217;s nice to see a simpler version of the logo without all the gradients and multiple colors and it works remarkably well in a single color but there is something rather odd about the combination of those two iconic elements with the new holding shape. It might be one thing too many. I&#8217;m not convinced it&#8217;s totally wrong or bad as it now gives Pizza Hut another graphic element to use as a quick identifier and you can see it working well in the <a href=\"https:\/\/order.pizzahut.com\/flavorofnow\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">new menu<\/a> (pictured below too in case our international readers can&#8217;t access it) where the splotch and the roof stand in as the logo.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pizza_hut_online_menu.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Pizza Hut by Deutsch LA\" \/>\n<figcaption>New ordering menu.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pizza_hut_flavor_of_now_type.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Pizza Hut by Deutsch LA\" \/>\n<figcaption>&#8220;Flavor of Now&#8221; type treatment.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Typographically, Pizza Hut is actually getting a little adventurous and outside the common visual language of pizzas with the use of an industrial-looking font family and the rugged Flavor of Now wordmark, which is not half bad.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pizza_hut_box.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Pizza Hut by Deutsch LA\" \/>\n<figcaption>Pizza box from press release.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pizza_hut_box_instagram.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Pizza Hut by Deutsch LA\" \/>\n<figcaption>Pizza box in reality.

The good thing is there is an animation of the logo at the end.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>In the videos above, particularly in the stunts, you can get a taste of their new design approach and, again, it&#8217;s not half bad. The bold typography has a welcome confidence to it and it more clearly separates Pizza Hut from Dominos.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pizza_hut_uniforms_00.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Pizza Hut by Deutsch LA\" \/>\n<figcaption>New &#8220;relaxed&#8221; (as described in the press release) uniforms.

Some of those t-shirts I would actually pay money to own (I&#8217;m looking at you vintage Pizza Hut logo t-shirt on the top left).<\/p>\n<p class=\"end\">Overall, you can definitely see that Pizza Hut is trying to be a little cooler and I think it does come across as a relatively genuine effort (other than the publicity stunts in the badly-named towns) with decent results, specially for a mainstream product like this.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established by two brothers in 1958 in Wichita, Kansas, with a single pizzeria, Pizza Hut, a subsidiary of Yum!
