It was also one of the most financially troubled museums in the Western world devoted exclusively to Asian Art with a $120 million debt, which was recently announced would be solved, setting the museum up for a much needed reinvention: &#8220;Our new brand,&#8221; explains Jay Xu, Director of the Asian Art Museum &#8220;promises to awaken the past and inspire the next. It means we&#8217;ll unlock the past for visitors and bring it to life by sparking connections. We&#8217;ll also be a catalyst for new art, new creativity and new thinking.&#8221; To help turn things around, literally, the Asian Art Museum worked with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wolffolins.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wolff Olins<\/a> to design its new identity.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>International brand consultancy Wolff Olins helped to redefine the brand and designed a new logo to directly reflect the museum&#8217;s bold vision and new perspective. Its graphic, upside down A mark, accompanied by the word &#8220;Asian,&#8221; also communicates the museum&#8217;s desire to engage all: in mathematics, an upside down A denotes &#8220;for all.&#8221;<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.davidperry.com\/asian-art-museum-launches-new-brand.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press Release<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe width=\"574\" height=\"292\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/4lvqIHkHR6I\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">David Perry of David Perry and Associates, the PR firm for the museum, on why we should be excited about the new look.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/asian_art_museum_detail.jpg\" alt=\"Asian Art Museum\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/asian_art_museum_logo_variations.jpg\" alt=\"Asian Art Museum\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The old logo was a little painful to watch, but it had good intentions and it sort of exuded Asian-ness with the red color and wispy type; it had an interesting play with the Asia\/n structure, but mostly it was just a little weird. The new one, in contrast, exudes not a single bit of Asian-ness. On the contrary, it could probably be a logo for anything <em>but<\/em> an Asian museum and that seems to help the point the Asian Art Museum is trying to make, that they are not just a warehouse of old Asian clich&eacute;s but a new kind of platform for Asian art and culture, both old and new. Obviously the biggest statement of the logo is the upside down &#8220;A&#8221;. The press release mentions that in mathematics the inverted &#8220;A&#8221; represents &#8220;for all&#8221; and I wonder how many people will know that &mdash; I didn&#8217;t, but I also use a calculator to sum two plus two sometimes. When I first saw the logo I tried to extract the meaning of the inverted &#8220;A&#8221; but other than a slightly corny &#8220;Think Different&#8221; I came up empty. It&#8217;s a bold move, and it has the advantage that there are no other upside down logos out there, so it certainly stands out.<\/p>\n<p>Like any logo thick enough to hold imagery, this one holds artifacts from the collection. It looks good, but it&#8217;s far from new. Good thing the holding shape is upside down to give the trick a new spin. I do like the subtle gradient that gives the logo some dimension.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/asian_art_museum_sigange_02.jpg\" alt=\"Asian Art Museum\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/asian_art_museum_signage_01.jpg\" alt=\"Asian Art Museum\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/asian_art_museum_signage_03.jpg\" alt=\"Asian Art Museum\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/asian_art_museum_brochures_01.jpg\" alt=\"Asian Art Museum\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/asian_art_museum_brochures_02.jpg\" alt=\"Asian Art Museum\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/asian_art_museum_brochures_03.jpg\" alt=\"Asian Art Museum\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/asian_art_museum_various.jpg\" alt=\"Asian Art Museum\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The rest of the materials are decent and support the direction of the logo. I like how the logo can be used big or small in different applications, showing a bit of versatility that, if lacking, would have made for a more stale range of applications. Overall, as a way of saying &#8220;this ain&#8217;t your ancestors Asian Art Museum&#8221; this identity certainly achieves its goal.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_111003_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_111003_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_111003_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_111003_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_111003_config_03.xml&#038;xyz=poll_111003_votes_03.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv3\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv3\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,63,26],"tags":[179,327,42,180],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1658"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1658"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1658\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1658"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1658"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1658"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
