In 2017, \u00a36.7 trillion moved through their system, enabling \u00a317.5 billion in payments every single day. Pay.UK is sort of the new parent brand of pre-existing payment services like Bacs Direct Credit, Direct Debit, Faster Payments, cheques and Paym. This past October, Pay.UK introduced its new identity, designed by London, UK-based <a href=\"https:\/\/someoneinlondon.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SomeOne<\/a>, who also conceived the name.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>The feedback we got from stakeholder research was that a new name had to be &#8216;short and snappy&#8217;, and &#8216;literally describe what we do&#8217;.With this in mind we renamed the organisation Pay.UK in recognition of its essential national service and digital future.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/someoneinlondon.com\/projects\/the-6-7-trillion-brand\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SomeOne project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pay_uk_logo_static.png\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Pay.UK by SomeOne\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo, static.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The identity itself had not only to be solid and simple, but also be contemporary enough to attract new fintechs entering the UK market. We wanted to get across the idea that Pay.UK was constantly &#8216;in motion&#8217; and not rigid as an institution.<br \/><br \/>To go with the new name, SomeOne created a continuously moving brand mark representing the organisation&#8217;s &#8216;gears in motion&#8217; and desire to be the &#8216;beating heart&#8217; of UK payments. When seen statically, the mark should never be the same, reflecting the unique payment patterns of every UK individual.<br \/><br \/>For this to be truly dynamic, the digital team at SomeOne developed a generative logo creator &#8211; an application where anyone could create their own version of the Pay.UK symbol.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/someoneinlondon.com\/projects\/the-6-7-trillion-brand\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SomeOne project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\" style=\"padding-bottom: 39.25%;\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pay_uk_logo.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo, animated.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pay_uk_icon_animation.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Icon animation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video controls controlsList=\"nodownload\" poster=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pay_uk_logo_generator.jpg\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pay_uk_logo_generator.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo generator.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old name sounded more like a category than an organization&#8217;s name &#8212; &#8220;New Payment System Operator&#8221; sounded more like &#8220;Telecommunications Service Provider&#8221; than &#8220;AT&amp;T&#8221;. Pay.UK is so unbelievably simple it&#8217;s a surprise they were able to take it. To a certain degree it almost sounds like a government agency and I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s a little misleading in giving the organization more apparent power than it has or than it should have. Anyway: good name, yo. The old logo didn&#8217;t help the name much, looking like a Nutrition Fact line item. The new logo is&#8230; different. As I&#8217;m trying to write this paragraph, I find myself starting and stopping on trying to assess the icon. One part of me appreciates how different it is &#8212; in either static or animated form &#8212; and trying to create almost a new category of icon. Another part of me finds it, particularly in motion, pretty disturbing. It&#8217;s like the inside of the mouth of a villain&#8217;s robot mascot that eats things. The individual shapes of the icon are not pleasant either. It&#8217;s really weird. I&#8217;m very much looking forward to reading the comments because I&#8217;m so unsure on this one.<\/p>\n<p>The wordmark is actually nice, especially given that it&#8217;s a font straight out of the box. In its simplicity it helps ground the icon and the size relationship in the lock-up makes the name the most visible element.<\/p>\n<blockquote>The word mark and brand&#8217;s typography all use Source Sans, Adobe&#8217;s first open source typeface family, primarily designed for user interfaces. As part of the brand world, this sits alongside a no-nonsense black and white colour palette and colour photography depicting the &#8216;real life&#8217; end users &#8211; people across the UK benefitting from fast, secure payments.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/someoneinlondon.com\/projects\/the-6-7-trillion-brand\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SomeOne project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pay_uk_business_cards.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Pay.UK by SomeOne\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pay_uk_booklet_covers.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Pay.UK by SomeOne\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pay_uk_booklet_spreads.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Pay.UK by SomeOne\" \/>\n<figcaption>Booklet covers and spreads.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The booklet covers achieve a very interesting, almost United-Nations-like look, that makes the identity feel very authoritative but, as paired with the customer photography, also accessible.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pay_uk_brand_pattern.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Pay.UK by SomeOne\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brand pattern.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pay_uk_lanyards.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Pay.UK by SomeOne\" \/>\n<figcaption>Lanyards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pay_uk_website.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Pay.UK by SomeOne\" \/>\n<figcaption>Website.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pay_uk_lobby.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Pay.UK by SomeOne\" \/>\n<figcaption>Lobby.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pay_uk_conference_room.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Pay.UK by SomeOne\" \/>\n<figcaption>Conference room.
