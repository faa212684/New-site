Time to design and vote. As a reminder: this stage is about creating and selecting the best ideas\/executions to later convert into Cotton Bureau campaigns which is when you will be able to pre-order the t-shirts.<\/p>\n<p>In case this doesn&#8217;t make sense, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/brand_new_co_op_shop_introduction.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here is the introduction post<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><h1 class=\"friday_likes red\" style=\"margin: 40px 0 10px;\">1. Getting started<\/h1>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/cottonbureau.com\/resources\/CB-NextLevel-MockupTemplate-2017.psd.zip\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Download the Cotton Bureau mock-up template (157Mb)<\/a>.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately the silhouette of the t-shirt is a little clunky but the PSD file has layers for all the t-shirt colors and textures available, so you will definitely want to use it.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes red\" style=\"margin: 40px 0 10px;\">2. General Guidelines<\/h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Overall, stick to ideas that are related to Brand New be it in recurring themes, specific insider references, and\/or more general notions related to logo, identity, and branding.<\/li>\n<li>General design, creativity, typography ideas are also welcome but are less representative of the goal of the Co-op Shop.<\/li>\n<li>Keep it fun, clean, and inclusive by not being unnecessarily mean and\/or overly sarcastic.<\/li>\n<li>We reserve the right to remove anything we deem offensive or insensitive.<\/li>\n<li>No logo parodies will be accepted as it&#8217;s likely they will attract legal action and we have no interest in fielding cease and desist letters.<\/li>\n<li>Different executions of the same idea presented coincidentally from two or more people are okay &#8212; it&#8217;s good to have options and the ones with the most upvotes will get moved into campaigns.<\/li>\n<li>If you have an idea but no time (or interest) to design it, share it and label it as a &#8220;free&#8221; idea for anyone to interpret.<\/li>\n<li>If you see an idea that you think could be executed differently, ask for permission to present your own execution &#8212; this is a gray area, so use common sense and decency!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes red\" style=\"margin: 40px 0 10px;\">3. Design Guidelines<\/h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Limit to 2 ink colors.<\/li>\n<li>Printable area is 11 inches wide by 14 inches tall on the front and\/or the back.<\/li>\n<li>You can use the front, the back, or both.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes red\" style=\"margin: 40px 0 10px;\">4. Posting Guidelines<\/h1>\n<h4 style=\"margin:20px 0 5px\"><strong>On quantity<\/strong><\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>You can post multiple ideas&#8230; say, 5.<\/li>\n<li>Don&#8217;t be overwhelming by posting 15 or 20.<\/li>\n<li>Don&#8217;t post minimal variations of the same idea (e.g., same layout and sentence but in 10 different fonts or color combinations).<\/li>\n<li>Self-edit before posting.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4 style=\"margin:40px 0 5px\"><strong>On format<\/strong><\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>You are encouraged to stick with the Cotton Bureau template to present your ideas. <li>It&#8217;s okay if you want to present it in your preferred t-shirt mock-up template.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4 style=\"margin:40px 0 5px\"><strong>On upload protocol<\/strong><\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Upload a single t-shirt per comment so that the voting applies to only one design at a time.<\/li>\n<li>Use the Disqus picture-upload feature to upload your design.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/BN_Co_Op_Shop_Promo_Upload_Instructions.png\" alt=\"Co-Op Shop: Open Submissions, Volume 1\" \/>\n<\/figure>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes red\" style=\"margin: 40px 0 10px;\">5. Voting Guidelines<\/h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Upvote if you would honestly consider buying the t-shirt.<\/li>\n<li>You can downvote if you like but, for whatever reason, Disqus has removed the option to publicly see downvotes. Not that they would play a big role anyway as the idea is to move forward with whatever gets upvoted the most.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes red\" style=\"margin: 40px 0 10px;\">6. Deadline<\/h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Wednesday November 7 to submit.<\/li>\n<li>Friday November 9 to vote. (You can upvote any time starting now, but we&#8217;ll stop tallying on Nov. 9.)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>After November 9 we will work as fast as possible with the most popular t-shirts to move them into Cotton Bureau campaigns and try to launch them before Thanksgiving so that, ideally, the first batch of t-shirts are ready to be received for the Holiday season.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll see how all this works out and make changes if necessary for Volume 2. Keep in mind that the sooner you upload your ideas the more votes it&#8217;s likely to gather.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Alright, here we go! Time to design and vote.
