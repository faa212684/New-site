This particular branding is for Brisbane in Australia &mdash; which would be so more exciting &mdash; and is developed specifically by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.brisbanemarketing.com.au\/Default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brisbane Marketing<\/a>, which is a subsidiary of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.brisbane.qld.gov.au\/BCC:BASE::pc=HOME\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brisbane City Council<\/a>. This identity takes the place of the Brisbane Marketing&#8217;s previous mark, but it doesn&#8217;t do away with it completely&hellip;<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/brisbane_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"Brisbane\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Brisbane Marketing has taken their previous Brisbane identity and relegated it to hang on their organization&#8217;s shingle. This previous identity was designed in 2003 by Minale Bryce Design Strategy (Seen in their current state at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.minale.com.au\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Minale Tattersfield<\/a>), and from what previous Minale Bryce Director Jack Bryce tells us, it was a bit controversial at the time &mdash;\ufffdreferred to in the press as &#8220;blob&#8221; and &#8220;splat&#8221; and not in a Nickelodeon-good way. Indeed, that logomark did look a bit like the green cousin of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.aiga.org\/content.cfm\/jack-we-hardly-knew-ye\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cingular&#8217;s Jack<\/a> was hit in the busy Brisbane streets. And to be clear, this identity is not going away, but rather appears as the mark associated with &#8220;Brisbane Marketing&#8221; (and in doing so, making way for a separate destination logo). This marketing logo can be seen in some of the marketing examples below and those provided in the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.brisbanemarketing.com.au\/Brand\/BrandElements\/StyleGuide.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">style guide<\/a> [free registration required].<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/brisbane_ads.jpg\" alt=\"Brisbane\" \/><\/p>\n<p>To make this even more confusing, there is the affordance for locking up the marketing organization logo (blob) with the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.brisbane.qld.gov.au\/BCC:BASE::pc=HOME\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brisbane City Council logo<\/a> (clock tower) &mdash; and the latter with the destination logo &mdash; but never the destination logo with the marketing logo (blob). So, We&#8217;ve got a clock tower and their resident blob which all help to promote Australia&#8217;s eastern-most big city.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/brisbane_marketing_logo.gif\" alt=\"Brisbane\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The new destination design (we&#8217;ve got a request out for design credits) takes a more conservative approach with its lowercase, multicolor wordmark. It&#8217;s type, it&#8217;s straightforward and sturdy, and it&#8217;s not terribly memorable. Supporting the new brand, the site for Brisbane Marketing maintains a rather extensive public set of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.brisbanemarketing.com.au\/Brand\/Default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brand Tools<\/a>. There are the standard set of elements (positioning, attributes, pyramid, etc) as well as an interesting distillation of a description for Brisbane, boiling down a 420-word statement to 250 words, then 120 words, and finally 70.<\/p>\n<blockquote>Brisbane. Positive and forward thinking, generous and optimistic.<br \/><br \/>We lead the world in infrastructure, health, biotechnology and education and our subtropical climate and sunny disposition is ideal for nurturing and inspiring creativity.<br \/><br \/>Brisbane is clean, green, friendly, tolerant and multicultural, creative, collaborative and liveable. It&#8217;s this openminded and globally responsible attitude that enables us to maintain a balance between progress and sustainability.<br \/><br \/>Welcome to Brisbane, Australia&#8217;s new world city.<\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/brisbane_colors.jpg\" alt=\"Brisbane\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/brisbane_colors_02.gif\" alt=\"Brisbane\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/brisbane_colors_03.gif\" alt=\"Brisbane\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If the marketing blob was as outspoken and playful as youth, the new identity is soft-spoken and more grown up. Grown up much in the way the modifier &#8220;it&#8217;s happening&#8221; has buttoned up into the tagline &#8220;Australia&#8217;s new world city&#8221;. This is a maturity from an adolescent marketing identity into destination adulthood,\ufffdand while this brand can now sit quietly in a room with other similar, adult brands without saying too much, the conversation might be kind of dull.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jackbryce.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jack Bryce<\/a> for the tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_20091209_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_20091209_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_20091209_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_20091209_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":4,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,64,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/986"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/4"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=986"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/986\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=986"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=986"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=986"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
