Rendered in black, red, and silver, the identity gains enough sophistication appropriate for a niche coffee roaster yet still remains amicably grounded. (Grounded.

A barely-there &#8220;M&#8221; anchors the materials, all of which are beautifully produced taking advantage of the independent pieces of the &#8220;M&#8221; to do die-cuts, embossings, and debossings all in a groovy khaki color palette. <a href=\"http:\/\/heydays.no\/project\/mellbye\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Abarrotes Delirio by Savvy Studio<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_abarrotes.jpg\" alt=\"Abarrotes Delirio by Savvy Studio\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px;\">Sticking with kick-ass, single-letter logos we now turn our attention to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.delirio.mx\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Abarrotes Delirio<\/a>, a cafe-slash-marketplace in the hipstery Colonia Roma in Mexico City where a rustic, industrial chic environment serves as a backdrop for unassuming signage and typography that play the best kind of un-designed design. Even the giant &#8220;A&#8221; logo found in some of the store&#8217;s materials could pass as an accidental stroke of purposeful identity.
