Based in San Francisco, CA, with offices in Amsterdam, Netherlands, and Perm, Russia, Miro counts with more than 2 million users and over 6,000 paying customers, including teams inside Netflix, Twitter, Cisco, Deloitte and others. Along with the recent name change, Miro introduced a new identity designed by The Hague, Netherlands-based <a href=\"https:\/\/vruchtvlees.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Vruchtvlees<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><p>A brand microsite can be found <a href=\"https:\/\/brand.realtimeboard.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<blockquote>Following the SCRUM method, the identity was developed within different creation sprints. Working together remotely on Miro enabled us to act fast. In the creation sprints, we explored different directions of the identity to create and capture Miro&#8217;s brand story. The result is a bright and vibrant new brand that is challenging and supportive in all its touchpoints.<br \/><br \/>We built Miro on Miro. The infinite working spaces of Miro offered a birds&#8217;-eye perspective that helped to oversee the entire process. By doing so, we did not only transcend physical boundaries but were also able to map out thought processes. The infinite workspace of Miro helped us to enhance our processes and take the project team along our thought processes.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/vruchtvlees.com\/project\/21\/miro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Vruchtvlees project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/miro_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Miro by Vruchtvlees\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/miro_logo_angle.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Miro by Vruchtvlees\" \/>\n<figcaption>Where the angle of the characters comes from.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo, I believe, was meant to represent a Post-It or a non-trademark sticky note, I guess. It wasn&#8217;t great but it wasn&#8217;t terrible either. The font choice was cool as a font but somehow totally unrelated to the product. The new name isn&#8217;t quite explained anywhere but <a href=\"https:\/\/realtimeboard.com\/blog\/features\/realtimeboard-is-now-miro\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the CEO does say<\/a> that it &#8220;reflects the essence of our values in one word&#8221; and it&#8217;s a nice word, so we&#8217;ll roll with it. The new logo is good, I think. It&#8217;s the first spurless &#8220;r&#8221; that I like in a while and the shape of the &#8220;o&#8221; is more intriguing than usual. The angled cut of the stems is what I&#8217;m not sure about &#8212; they are both distinctive in a good way but distracting in a bad way. I&#8217;m also undecided if the rationalization of the angles as being the degree at which Miro&#8217;s offices are in relation to one another is laudable or laughable but, hey, it&#8217;s a simple wordmark with a little more personality than is expected or typical from an online platform.<\/p>\n<blockquote>The building blocks of the brand form the basis for a visual language consisting of four &#8216;collaborative characters&#8217;. Each character speaks its own visual professional language and illustrates one of the key features of the Miro tool. They are not static but can transform on their own specific principles of transformation. Together they get every job done.<br \/><br \/>The characters on their own are cheerful and dynamic. They can be used to tell a story, convey feelings or amplify meaning. The characters can also be used as vibrant patterns to easily brand billboards, posters or landing pages. Combined with illustrations, the characters are more to the background allowing the content to take center stage.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/vruchtvlees.com\/project\/21\/miro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Vruchtvlees project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/miro_shapes_animated_all.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Miro by Vruchtvlees\" \/>\n<figcaption>The &#8220;characters&#8221;, shapes that spell out &#8220;MIRO&#8221;.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The coolest aspect about the identity are the abstract, animated shapes that at first I thought were gratuitously random &#8212; and even then I liked them &#8212; but that, as I was preparing this post, I learned that they are abstract representations of &#8220;M&#8221;, &#8220;I&#8221;, &#8220;R&#8221;, and &#8220;O&#8221;.
