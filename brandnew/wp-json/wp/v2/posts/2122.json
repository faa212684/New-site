There needs to be a hook or story that people can relate to, and connect to, so that it makes the brand more memorable.<\/h1>\n<h1 style=\"color:#000000!important;padding-bottom:10px;\">We ask ourselves often whether there&#8217;s a need to have a logo for a brand or if a brand can exist without a logo. [We think a brand can be] more about patterns, illustration, smell, sound, and touch.<\/h1>\n<h1 style=\"color:#000000!important;padding-bottom:10px;\">Typically a client will approach a design agency with a project and a laundry list of to-dos. It is an equally good idea [for an agency] to come up with an idea or concept and take it to the client. Agency initiated ideas or concepts need not be constrained to one particular client.<\/h1>\n<h1 style=\"color:#000000!important;padding-bottom:10px;\">Our process is about 70% storytelling and 30% application. Sometimes our clients complain that we are a little bit slow but I think [storytelling] is important. I think anybody can design a really beautiful logo; we just want to make something that&#8217;s more than that, something memorable.<\/h1>\n<p class=\"red\"><strong>A few of her quotes captured in tweets and audience opinions:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>@XK9:<\/strong> @yahlengyu Yah-Leng Yu.

I think the problem with culture for me is that it provides rules and myths according to which we all repeat ourselves. If design is to be useful for business, to play a positive role in the economy, I feel it should cut all links with art.<\/h1>\n<h1 style=\"color:#000000!important;padding-bottom:10px;\">Do I have any favorite techniques? Techniques are habits, and habits are a refusal of the moment and a reliving of the past. A habitual person is not interested in the present, but a person with habits can have style. The person who lives in the moment cannot have style.<\/h1>\n<p class=\"red\"><strong>A few of his quotes captured in tweets and audience opinions:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>@WolffOlins:<\/strong> @MilesNewlyn &#8220;winning awards for other people to collect&#8221; &#8211; quite the dramatic intro #BNConf<\/p>\n<p><strong>@_scottfuller:<\/strong> &#8220;A logo is a kind of flag, and people fight beneath flags.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>@debbiemillman:<\/strong> I&#8217;m thinking that @milesnewlyn is a genius. #bnconf<\/p>\n<p><strong>@rademark_:<\/strong> My process begins with ugliness, a deep understanding of it is necessary to get to beauty and realness @milesnewlyn #BNConf<\/p>\n<p><strong>@elenithecamera:<\/strong> &#8220;When I find truth &#8211; when I know it&#8217;s finished.&#8221; #truthistruth @MilesNewlyn is a philosopher as much as he is a creator of beauty. #bnconf<\/p>\n<p><strong>@misspixels:<\/strong> Glory doesn&#8217;t get you anywhere says @milesnewlyn #BNConf<\/p>\n<p><strong>@malcontentnyc:<\/strong> @MilesNewlyn @bnconf Lovely, subtle presentation.

If we come in with ideas about new products or how to take a product and move it into a new channel, they&#8217;re open to those ideas. They ask us to take them on and develop them and build them, and then we end up with assignments that are really and truly interesting.<\/h1>\n<h1 style=\"color:#000000!important;padding-bottom:10px;\">Simplicity is a clear and compelling action that requires honesty, skill and courage. Its beauty lies in being both unexpectedly fresh and remarkably self-evident. It&#8217;s surprising, but only because we should have thought of it before.<\/h1>\n<h1 style=\"color:#000000!important;padding-bottom:10px;\">The design problems [we face] span core essential identity and logo and graphic systems, but they can go a lot deeper than that in helping companies, organizations, brands, and universities engage with really important people in ways that matter and help them succeed.<\/h1>\n<h1 style=\"color:#000000!important;padding-bottom:10px;\">As our world becomes more and more complex, people increasingly crave what&#8217;s simple and true and trustworthy.<\/h1>\n<h1 style=\"color:#000000!important;padding-bottom:10px;\">Simplicity matters worldwide. 70% of people around the world equate simplicity with peace of mind and say it actually reduces the stress in their lives. [This demonstrates] that simplicity is a core human need. If you&#8217;re a designer, and you know that, that can provide enormous focus as you commence any design assignment.<\/h1>\n<h1 style=\"color:#000000!important;padding-bottom:10px;\">People around the world recognize that if they don&#8217;t control complexity, it will control them. The design question then becomes, &#8216;How can we help them master complexity?&#8217;. That, in my view, is one of the new, big, brand challenges. The brands that answer that question correctly are going to win passion from customers, passion from employees, and respect from the outside world.<\/h1>\n<p class=\"red\"><strong>A few of his quotes captured in tweets and audience opinions:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>@nadwoasey:<\/strong> The better the questions, the better the design opportunity &#8212; Howard Belk #bnconf<\/p>\n<p><strong>@R_GordonSmith:<\/strong> Simple is smart because simplicity cuts through the clutter to the essence of a problem #bnconf #SiegelGale (Howard Belk)<\/p>\n<p><strong>@randygregoryII:<\/strong> Howard Belk explains how they worked on the IRS.

Because from a bad client, you will get a worse client thereafter. If you get a good client to begin, you will get a better client thereafter. It is better to starve than get a bad client, because from a bad client you just go down.<\/h1>\n<h1 style=\"color:#000000!important;padding-bottom:10px;\">Always not only work with the best client, but deal with the top.

Middle management is a disease.<\/h1>\n<h1 style=\"color:#000000!important;padding-bottom:10px;\">That is the position for the designers, to expand quality through the new devices, and not to expand junk, which unfortunately is usually the first approach. <\/h1>\n<h1 style=\"color:#000000!important;padding-bottom:10px;\">Don&#8217;t work for money, because it&#8217;s the lousiest profession in the world to make money.<\/h1>\n<h1 style=\"color:#000000!important;padding-bottom:10px;\">You do design because you feel it inside; you have a moral issue to spread quality in our environment.<\/h1>\n<p class=\"red\"><strong>A few of his quotes captured in tweets and audience opinions:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>@rademark_:<\/strong> &#8220;A designer should be able to design everything, from a spoon to a city&#8221; @vignelli #BNConf<\/p>\n<p><strong>@randygregoryII:<\/strong> @vignelli has an energy that even young designers don&#8217;t posses. #bnconf<\/p>\n<p><strong>@XK9:<\/strong> Massimo Vignelli!

They&#8217;re like people, they need personality. At the end of the day, people don&#8217;t fall in love with businesses, they fall in love with personalities.<\/h1>\n<h1 style=\"color:#000000!important;padding-bottom:10px;\">I do miss [designing]. At one point, when it got a little bigger and I realized I didn&#8217;t have time to design anymore, it got really frustrating for me. I think that was just me transitioning into a creative director role. A designer would do something and I would say, &#8216;Let me take your file and mess around with it,&#8217; and of course the designers got kind of insulted. After awhile I started learning to just let go and trust it and really communicate better.<\/h1>\n<h1 style=\"color:#000000!important;padding-bottom:10px;\">What I&#8217;ve learned through the process of working in different mediums is that it&#8217;s really not about the medium. When you create brands, it has to be applied across every touch point and every touch point has to speak differently.<\/h1>\n<p class=\"red\"><strong>A few of her quotes captured in tweets and audience opinions:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>@melenaholder:<\/strong> Yo Santosa is adorable; you can see her personality through her branding of pinkberry @ferroconcrete #bnconf<\/p>\n<p><strong>@ConroyLand:<\/strong> Yolanda Santosa- pinkberry to hustler, the afternoon is looking up! #bnconf<\/p>\n<p><strong>@kristifrancisco:<\/strong> I now have a girlcrush on Yo Santosa from @ferroconcrete as well.

Often the most valuable part of the branding program actually goes on behind the scenes. Internal engagements, giving an organization and a brand renewed focus and passion and belief and unity. That&#8217;s something that not a lot of people see that don&#8217;t work in branding.<\/h1>\n<h1 style=\"color:#000000!important;padding-bottom:10px;\">Design isn&#8217;t just an iterative process, it&#8217;s actually a really emotional one. We have to really care about what we&#8217;re doing, and care about out clients&#8217; businesses.<\/h1>\n<h1 style=\"color:#000000!important;padding-bottom:10px;\">We design feelings first, not graphics.<\/h1>\n<h1 style=\"color:#000000!important;padding-bottom:10px;\">It&#8217;s often said that a brand is like a person. What I would add to that is that branding is about finding the very best in that person.

When my freelance started to outweigh what I was making on the clock pretending to like to have to fly down to Southern California to work on action sports shit, that&#8217;s when I, like good Midwesterner, put in my month&#8217;s notice.<\/h1>\n<h1 style=\"color:#000000!important;padding-bottom:10px;\">When you&#8217;re lamenting the big job, the small job, the tough job, the whatever, think about how lucky we are to do this shit.

I&#8217;ve washed dishes, cut my hands to shit, for four summers up in Alaska just to buy the tools that every kid seems to have now. Every time I hear someone lamenting about having to make a client change or work some long hours, it&#8217;s just kind of like, man, stop.
