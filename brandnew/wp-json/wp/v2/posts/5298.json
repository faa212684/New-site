Taking inspiration from the famous Shakespearean quote, &#8216;Though this be madness, yet there is method in &#8216;t&#8217;, METHOD AND MADNESS is designed to reflect a next generation Irish spirit brand with a measure of curiosity and intrigue (MADNESS), while honouring the tradition and expertise grounded in the generations of expertise at the Midleton Distillery (METHOD).<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.irishdistillers.ie\/2017\/02\/23\/irish-distillers-masters-apprentices-unite-create-next-generation-irish-whiskey\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Irish Distillers press release<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/method_and_madness_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Method and Madness by M&amp;E\" \/>\n<figcaption>Primary logo (stacked).

The &#8220;MM&#8221; monogram is a nice complement and bonus graphic device that subtly alludes to the sometimes necessary embrace of both method and madness to achieve something interesting. Both wordmark and monogram, in their starkness, serve as great accents for the more colorful and expressive packaging.<\/p>\n<blockquote>Inspired by the Masters and Apprentices working side by side at the new micro distillery, the brand identity strives to convey the sense of excitement of when tradition and innovation are combined.<br \/><br \/>The brand identity uses two opposing patterns throughout all the labeling and packaging. The use of straight lines symbolizes method and order, while the marbled patterns reference madness and liquid experimentation.<br \/><br \/>The octagonal shape of the bottle was designed to refract and bounce light. The side panel embossings were created to produce a kaleidoscope of patterns within the bottle, bringing method and madness together.<\/blockquote><h3>M&amp;E provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/method_and_madness_bottles.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Method and Madness by M&amp;E\" \/>\n<figcaption>Bottles.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/method_and_madness_bottle_detail_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Method and Madness by M&amp;E\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/method_and_madness_bottle_detail_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Method and Madness by M&amp;E\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/method_and_madness_bottle_detail_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Method and Madness by M&amp;E\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/method_and_madness_bottle_detail_04.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Method and Madness by M&amp;E\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/method_and_madness_bottle_detail_05.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Method and Madness by M&amp;E\" \/>\n<figcaption>Details.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The packaging feels richly layered with labels divided in three columns: the left showing an ordered pattern (&#8220;method&#8221;), the middle displaying the logo, and the right showing a custom marbling pattern (&#8220;madness&#8221;). Like the wordmark, it&#8217;s an odd combination but the name supports the literal yet metaphorical translation. The marbling patterns are fun and exotic and I admire that they have &#8220;separated&#8221; the colors in order to isolate certain strands to be foil stamped in gold (as opposed to printing a full-color image in straight CMYK). The neck labels are almost like the equivalent of a responsive website, where the same long design of the body has been adapted to the shorter footprint and the monogram works as a perfect accent. The one thing that stands out oddly are the bottom labels with the whisky information, looking almost clinical like a prescription medicine bottle but those are the joys of alcohol packaging: facts.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/method_and_madness_bottle_cap.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Method and Madness by M&amp;E\" \/>\n<figcaption>Cap.
