In 2005, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.littlewoods.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Littlewoods<\/a> merged with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.shopdirect.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Shop Direct<\/a> and established Littlewoods Direct as the online and catalog consumer brand that in the last four years has become one of the leading retailers in the UK. And this past July, Littlewoods Direct rebranded itself as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.very.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Very<\/a> and repositioned to appeal to a younger demographic &mdash; 25 &ndash; 45 according to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.retail-week.com\/multichannel\/littlewoods-direct-to-undergo-very-rebrand\/5003658.article\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this article<\/a> &mdash; with the help of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wolffolins.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wolff Olins<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/very_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"Very Logo, Detail\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/very_colours_logo.jpg\" alt=\"Very Logo, Before and After\" \/><\/p>\n<div class=\"caption\">Twitter icon.<\/div>\n<p>Offering over 10,000 products in the fashion, mother and baby, and home and technology categories, Very is striving to give online shopping a boost of social networking by providing a range of forums on their web site, all through a consistently bubbly and preppy look and tone, to a fault I think. The whole brand feels very much like a teenage brand and I have a hard time making a connection between the overly colorful graphics and the fact that I could buy a $2,500 leather couch. There is a little bit of a disconnect in that respect.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/very_covers.jpg\" alt=\"Very Magazine and Directory\" \/><\/p>\n<div class=\"caption\">Magazine and directory covers.<\/div>\n<p>But, visually, this is a really exciting brand. The new wordmark is unexpected and is quite simple, with its chunky curlycues giving it enough personality and memorability. I do wonder what the wordmark would look like with the opposite spacing: Something that lets those curvy letterforms breathe and allow the consumer to enjoy those friendly curves. The supporting graphics are simple and can take form as a variety of visual devices which goes a long way for a company with such a vast range of offerings.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/very_application_01.jpg\" alt=\"Very Logo, Before and After\" \/><\/p>\n<div class=\"caption\">Very bags at sneak preview event. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/verynetwork\/3631407421\/in\/set-72157619816587728\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Photo source<\/a>.<\/div>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/very_application_02.jpg\" alt=\"Very Logo, Before and After\" \/><\/p>\n<div class=\"caption\">Very event in Glasgow. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/verynetwork\/3631537299\/in\/set-72157619819345058\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">>Photo source<\/a>.<\/div>\n<p>The images above show how its possible to give the brand a slightly more sophisticated and mature look with an all-black approach.
