It&#8217;s also the most yellow. Since early this year, Hertz has slowly been introducing a new logo first brought in February from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flyertalk.com\/forum\/hertz\/918144-hertz-survey-rebranding.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a customer survey<\/a>. With the logo now on Hertz&#8217;s web site and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hertz.com\/rentacar\/abouthertz\/index.jsp?targetPage=investorrelations.jsp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the cover of the 2008 annual report<\/a> I would have expected a little more fanfare or at least more information, but there is none unfortunately.<\/p><!--more--><p>The previous logo had its charms. There was something convincing about the pronounced italic and the heavy-handed shadow. It at least stood out like a monolith in an airport amidst all the other car rental logos. It was impossible to miss. Again, the yellow helped, so it might be safe to say that Hertz could change to comic sans and as long as they kept that yellow they would still have a recognizable identity within the car rental category. A thin theory I guess, but I digress. The new logo is more in tune with today&#8217;s sensibilities and I like that it is an evolution and not a complete redesign. The letterforms are friendly and there is a very nice rhythm to the &#8220;rtz&#8221; part. Compared to the old logo, the new one feels flimsy and delicate but overall it&#8217;s a nice contemporary update.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"red\">Update:<\/span> The correct logo has been updated in the image above; as some noted, the crossbar of the &#8220;H&#8221; should have been lower.
