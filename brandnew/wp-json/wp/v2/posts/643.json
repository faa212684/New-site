But I find this to be an excellent example of how much identity design has changed and how ubiquitous 3Dimensionalization has become that, now, 3D logos are being revisited and getting redrawn to be more shiny, voluptuous and realistic. One of my favorite designers, typographers and letterers is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.typedesign.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jim Parkinson<\/a>, who, among other talents, has made an art form of redrawing logos that needed more cohesiveness or kick-assedness &mdash; i.e. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.typedesign.com\/logos\/austin.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">01<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.typedesign.com\/logos\/burlington.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">02<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.typedesign.com\/logos\/chicago.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">03<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.typedesign.com\/logos\/latina.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">04<\/a> &mdash; through a detailed exercise of typographic perfection and nuance. The work of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.joefino.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Joe Fino<\/a> also comes to mind, as someone that can refine letterforms to reveal uniqueness. These, and other designers, are the masters of the nip and tuck. This new iteration of DIRECTV represents the new form of identity nip and tuck: Less about typographic or icon refinement, and more about highlight and shadow enhancement. While it&#8217;s easy and expected to cringe at this as a gut reaction, it may be time to accept that this is the new standard, and someone might as well do it right. The old DIRECTV logo was crudely Photoshop&#8217;d, and is more reminiscent of early, beveled web graphics. The new one is much more intentional, purposeful and rationalized in the effect, plus it&#8217;s probably done with the more powerful and scalable mesh and gradient tools in Illustrator. So I may not find conceptual beauty in these glossy logos, but I can acknowledge when something is better crafted and judge it within the context of current day identity work.
