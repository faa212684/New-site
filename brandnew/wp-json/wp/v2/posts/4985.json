Its identity, by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/triborodesign.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Triboro<\/a>, revolves around a lively m\u00e9lange of abstract shapes and colors that feel like the baby we never knew we wanted of mid-century modern and tropical-Tiki-something. What they are, what they mean, doesn&#8217;t really matter as they are full of explosive, visual joy. The shapes stand in stark contrast with the literally minimal logo in a hand-written, super spaced out wordmark &#8212; a typographic style that runs throughout the menus as well. It&#8217;s all an odd combination of elements but it works quite well. <a href=\"http:\/\/triborodesign.com\/work\/sauvage\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Sentralen by Metric Design<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_sentralen.jpg\" alt=\"Sentralen by Metric Design\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.sentralen.no\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sentralen<\/a> is a center for culture and innovation in Oslo, Norway, housed in a 115-year-old building previously occupied by a bank and now offers its six halls for rent for a variety of events and performances. The identity by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.metricdesign.no\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Metric Design<\/a>, picks up where the bank, Sparebanken, left off by using <a href=\"http:\/\/underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Sentralen_Metric_0025.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">their 1930s logo<\/a> as a starting point to develop a custom logo with a Blackletter-lite aesthetic. The result is a great mix of old and new &#8212; just like the building and its new tenant &#8212; with a strong rhythm to it. Based on the logo and materials of the bank, Metric Design also created a custom type family in collaboration with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ellmerstefan.net\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ellmer Stefan<\/a> that is then deployed across all materials and wayfinding. The overall look is effectively unified by typography, with special bursts of awesome in those numbers. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.metricdesign.no\/work\/sentralen\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Carpenters Wharf by Jack Renwick Studio<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_carpenterswharf.jpg\" alt=\"Carpenters Wharf by Jack Renwick Studio\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/carpenterswharf.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Carpenters Wharf<\/a> is a new apartment building in the creative and artistic enclave of Fish Island, London. Reflecting the industrial history of the area and specifically that the site was previously used by a furniture maker, London-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jackrenwickstudio.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jack Renwick Studio<\/a> built an identity around the textures of locally-sourced wood that was inked, printed, and scanned. The textures are masked inside a bevy of geometric arrangements and paired with a sturdy sans serif. The mix feels both rugged and luxurious and some of the type and image combinations are absolutely winning. In a nice twist I like how the type and textures are rendered in white where you would expect it to be black or dark and I love how the wood textures are transparent, allowing the photos to seep through. <a href=\"http:\/\/identitydesigned.com\/carpenters-wharf\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"From colorful and abstract to black-and-white and figurative, plenty of range this week with work from Brooklyn, Oslo, and London&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[1058,564],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4985"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4985"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4985\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4985"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4985"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4985"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
