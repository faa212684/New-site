It is an initiative that stems from Vietnam entering a &#8220;middle income&#8221; global status, making its UNICEF chapter ineligible for external funding yet still with a need to combat the reality that &#8220;100 children would die daily of preventable causes in the country.&#8221; Built as a fundraising platform, the ZEROawards turned out to be an outstanding effort, attracting Vietnam&#8217;s stars, philanthropists, and socialites while raising $440,000 in a single night &mdash; enough to treat over 50,000 children. The identity for the campaign and event was designed by Vietnam-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rice-creative.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rice<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>Building upon UNICEF&#8217;s global platform &#8220;Believe in ZERO&#8221; (who&#8217;s aim is to bring the number of preventable child deaths to zero) we created and branded a new, high profile property called the UNICEF ZEROawards. [&hellip;] The brand, centered around a simple logo mark, which visually explains the cause with a call to action. A zero &#8220;0&#8221; is built from hundreds of pluses &#8220;+&#8221;, with each plus representing the power of individual donations to make ZERO become a reality.<\/blockquote><h3>Provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/89377677?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>ZEROawards introduction.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/unicef_zero_awards_logo_detail.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for UNICEF ZEROawards by Rice\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Perhaps it&#8217;s the feel-good, successful preamble of the ZEROawards influencing my opinion but, from logo to physical award (scroll down), this identity is quite excellent. The concept behind the logo, a zero made out of pluses, is smart and appropriate but in the wrong hands this could have turned out cloying and ugly. The dimensional effect through the perfectly calibrated sizing and positioning of each plus sign gives the logo a visual richness and textural depth deployed with great restraint in each application.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/unicef_zero_awards_materials_multiple.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for UNICEF ZEROawards by Rice\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/unicef_zero_awards_materials_multiple_detail.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for UNICEF ZEROawards by Rice\" \/>\n<figcaption>Various materials.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/unicef_zero_awards_invitation.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for UNICEF ZEROawards by Rice\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/unicef_zero_awards_invitation_detail.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for UNICEF ZEROawards by Rice\" \/>\n<figcaption>Invitation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The use of embossing brings out the best quality of the logo and adds a great touch of sophistication to each piece, even with the garish organizational blue color of UNICEF.
