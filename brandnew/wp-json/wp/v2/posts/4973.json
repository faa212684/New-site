In the U.S., they are the market leader in terms of recognition and volume. Their strawberries are usually double the price than &#8220;off-brand&#8221; strawberries but they are pretty darn good and when their blackberries are in season they are spectacular. <em>The New York Times<\/em> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2016\/09\/07\/business\/driscolls-aims-to-hook-the-berry-buying-shopper.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">published a long piece<\/a> recently about their business and approach to growing berries to coincide with the introduction of a new look and campaign aimed at getting the attention of the millennial demographic.

You&#8217;ll find that each unique berry we grow is celebrated in a fresh, colorful palette. While our look is new, our promise remains the same &#8211; Only the Finest Berries\u2122.<br \/><br \/>Notice how we sign our name with a more personalized handwritten feel. You&#8217;ll find an iconic Driscoll&#8217;s Dot atop the &#8220;i&#8221; which symbolizes all of our delicious berries. While the Driscoll&#8217;s Dot can take on the color of each berry, the main represents strawberries since that&#8217;s where our roots began.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.driscolls.com\/share-the-berry-joy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Driscoll&#8217;s new look page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/driscolls_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Driscoll&amp;apos;s by Pearlfisher\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/driscolls_logo_hero.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Driscoll&amp;apos;s by Pearlfisher\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo with berry stuff.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Since I&#8217;m in the market for berries on a weekly basis, I am quite familiar with Driscoll&#8217;s and I&#8217;ve always like their old wordmark. Simple, not trying too hard, and easy to recognize. It doesn&#8217;t move me in any emotional way but the curvy letterforms were berry-ish. The new logo definitely tries to be more emotional with the change to a hand-drawn script that is fairly attractive with its more dynamic structure but I&#8217;m left scratching my head about whether it&#8217;s meant to be a script or just an italic wordmark because &#8220;coll&#8221; is a script but the rest of the letters are awkwardly left completely unconnected. The other weird thing is the color change, going from a lively green to a muted, almost olive green that doesn&#8217;t feel fresh. The tittle of the &#8220;i&#8221; can change colors to denote the different berries, which is cute.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/driscolls_patterns_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Driscoll&amp;apos;s by Pearlfisher\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/driscolls_patterns_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Driscoll&amp;apos;s by Pearlfisher\" \/>\n<figcaption>Patterns.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/driscolls_instagram.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Driscoll&amp;apos;s by Pearlfisher\" \/>\n<figcaption>Instagram-y stuff.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>A set of berry patterns has been introduced into the identity and the watercolor-y illustrations serve to anchor the presentation of the products and add some cheerfulness to the website. The illustrations are charming and it&#8217;s nice to see that although they aim for a minimalist shape they still have some texture to them. Paired with Sudtipos&#8217; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.myfonts.com\/fonts\/sudtipos\/blog-script\/?refby=ucllc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Blog Script<\/a>, the identity establishes a clear and consistent style that, as nice as it is, I think will appeal more to 30-something moms than the intended millennials &#8212; which, really, I don&#8217;t think they are in the market for fresh berries anyway.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/t4Rz1ols9bU\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Introduction to new look.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/driscolls_packaging_history.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Driscoll&amp;apos;s by Pearlfisher\" \/>\n<figcaption>Packaging history.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/driscolls_old_look.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Driscoll&amp;apos;s by Pearlfisher\" \/>\n<figcaption>Previous packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/driscolls_packaging_hero.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Driscoll&amp;apos;s by Pearlfisher\" \/>\n<figcaption>New packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/driscolls_strawberries.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Driscoll&amp;apos;s by Pearlfisher\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/driscolls_blueberries.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Driscoll&amp;apos;s by Pearlfisher\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/driscolls_blackberries.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Driscoll&amp;apos;s by Pearlfisher\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/driscolls_raspberries.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Driscoll&amp;apos;s by Pearlfisher\" \/>\n<figcaption>Packaging detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">The packaging itself is typical berry packaging in that it comes in clear plastic containers &#8212; that require Hulk-like strength in your fingers to pry open &#8212; with a label on them that allows for maximum visibility of the berries. The old label was fairly forgettable but, again, easy to spot and identify. The new labels are an improvement in that they break away from a more traditional die-cut and introduce different berry-contoured labels that play well with the content inside. Here, again, the muted green does a disservice to the packaging by looking a little drab and all the secondary colors are also on the low-contrast spectrum which is odd as I think this product screams for full contrast. All the necessary additional typography fit in better in the old label shape and here feels forced into it. Overall, the ingredients are there to make this pretty great but the final presentation &#8212; especially on the packaging &#8212; fell a little flat.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Dating back to the late 1800s, Driscoll&apos;s is a fourth generation, family-owned company producing strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, and blueberries by working with independent farmers.
