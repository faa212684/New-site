In 1950, there were only 7 Grands Prix but with the rising popularity of the sport, 2017 saw 20 Grands Prix around the world. Have I said &#8220;world&#8221; enough times? Maybe one more: Formula 1 is one of the most popular sports in the world. This weekend, at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, the last race of the 2017 season, Formula 1 introduced a new logo designed by the London, UK, office of <a href=\"http:\/\/wklondon.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wieden + Kennedy<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><p>Suggested reading: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.creativereview.co.uk\/formula-1-unveils-new-identity-wieden-kennedy-london\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Creative Review<\/a> has a great in-depth interview with W+K&#8217;s Richard Turley.<\/p>\n<blockquote>Richard Turley, executive creative director of content and design, led the project for W+K London. &#8220;Creatively, the challenge was to reposition Formula 1 as a forward-facing entertainment brand, which works across a multitude of channels,&#8221; he said.<br \/><br \/>&#8220;The new mark aims to embody the core forces of Formula 1 racing: speed, attack, and control; while its sleek, sharp interlocking components celebrate the technical prowess of Formula 1 engineering teams.<br \/><br \/>&#8220;Its aesthetic is aspirational and leans into the future, but extends naturally from a rich heritage of motorsport graphics.&#8221;<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/wklondon.com\/2017\/11\/formula-1-unleashed\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">W+K London news page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/f1_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo for Formula 1 by Wieden + Kennedy\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/f1_logo_shading.png\" alt=\"New Logo for Formula 1 by Wieden + Kennedy\" \/>\n<figcaption>Shading version on white and black backgrounds.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo was designed in 1987 by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.carterwongdesign.com\/our-work\/formula-1-a-world-class-identity\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Carter Wong<\/a> and it&#8217;s one of the best\u00a0&#8212; or, at least, one of the most mainstream and recognizable &#8212; uses of negative space in a logo. The extreme italic angle and the fasty-fast lines on the right made it clear the logo was about speed. The old wordmark was highly questionable and I doubt it would withstand media scrutiny if launched today. Still, 30 years is a long time and this logo had built a lot of equity and many, many fans around the world.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s hard to tell if there was really a need for this logo to change; I see it more like an NBA\/NFL\/Olympics-level logo where it isn&#8217;t so much about the logo being fashionable or in tune with the whims of the times but instead be a consistent seal of quality. Still, I do understand that the logo was 30 years old and there was a recent change of ownership &#8212; with U.S.-based Liberty Media purchasing the F1 and controlling the contracts, worldwide distribution, and commercial management rights and licenses &#8212; so the time was right for a major change.<\/p>\n<p>The new logo doesn&#8217;t <em>yet<\/em> instantly (or clearly) scream &#8220;F1!&#8221; but after one or two seasons of use it definitely will, simply because that&#8217;s what people will see when they are watching a Formula 1 event. Right now, the change is jarring because the old one was so clear. Arguably, this monogram reads neither as an &#8220;F&#8221; nor as a &#8220;1&#8221; since the characters are so abstracted but since they exist in the context of racing, it&#8217;s really not that hard to make the deduction. I&#8217;m not emotionally attached to the old logo &#8212; I appreciate its cleverness but that&#8217;s about it &#8212; so I&#8217;m not &#8220;mad&#8221; at this new logo, as many people online are, and I happen to like it, a lot. It breaks from any contemporary conventions of logos: it&#8217;s not square to fit in social media avatars, it&#8217;s not &#8220;flattened&#8221;, it&#8217;s not hipster, and it&#8217;s italicized as hell. It sort of reminds me of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/new_logo_and_identity_for_juventus_by_interbrand.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Juventus logo<\/a> (that many people also despised) where this is being positioned as much as a sports event logo as it is a lifestyle logo with more merchandise\/swag appeal. This new logo might not become as beloved as the old one but it has so much more commercial potential and, after all, Formula 1 is big business.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/f1_wordmark.png\" alt=\"New Logo for Formula 1 by Wieden + Kennedy\" \/>\n<figcaption>Wordmark. (DISCLAIMER: not official; this image was put together by me based on the F1 Regular image below. There is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.motorsportweek.com\/\/admin\/ckfinder\/userfiles\/images\/Formula1\/new-logo.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this other version<\/a> floating around, with the notched &#8220;m&#8221;, but that&#8217;s not what appears in application in the very last image of this post.)<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The new wordmark is based on one of the three custom typefaces designed by The Hague, Netherlands-based <a href=\"http:\/\/marcrouault.tumblr.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Marc Rouault<\/a>. It has an <a href=\"https:\/\/i.pinimg.com\/originals\/bd\/47\/b0\/bd47b063c8963e6eb908be04a2a90cf2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">old United Airlines<\/a> vibe that I really like although my brain and heart are thoroughly confused by the &#8220;a&#8221;. I hate it as much as I love it. And that &#8220;1&#8221; is hot, as are all the numerals. I think this wordmark is hard to swallow because of how&#8230; retro it is but I bet if this wordmark had been done in the 1950s and it were getting replaced we would all be moaning about it.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/f1_type_regular.png\" alt=\"New Logo for Formula 1 by Wieden + Kennedy\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/f1_type_turbo.png\" alt=\"New Logo for Formula 1 by Wieden + Kennedy\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/f1_type_torque.png\" alt=\"New Logo for Formula 1 by Wieden + Kennedy\" \/>\n<figcaption>Custom typefaces: Regular, Turbo, and Torque.

I feel like they exude some nostalgia for the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.seriouswheels.com\/pics-1960-1969\/1962-Porsche-Type-804-Formula-1-car-1024x768.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">old Formula 1 cars<\/a> but also have a cool edge to them. Perhaps there is a disconnect between the typography and the fact that today&#8217;s F1 cars are some of the most technologically advanced machines but, still, I think these are going to make for some cool-looking print, motion, and apparel applications. (Aside from the goofy wreath crown graphics in the renders below, the merch look pretty cool if you are into the whole F1 aesthetic.)<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/f1_merchandise.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Formula 1 by Wieden + Kennedy\" \/>\n<figcaption>Merchandise.

I do feel the old-school, space-age-exploration aesthetic needs to be tempered a little but not with MTV-style motion graphics; it needs some more elegance to keep catering to the affluent fan base it has without being overly smarmy. Overall, I&#8217;m a fan of the change. I wouldn&#8217;t defend it passionately but I think once the shock wears off from leaving the old logo behind this new logo is a good one to have in the driver&#8217;s seat.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1950, Formula 1 &#8212; officially the FIA (F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l&apos;Automobile) World Championship of Drivers &#8212; is the top-tier, single-seat, auto racing competition in the world, with the fastest cars in the world, competing in multiple Grand Prix&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,7,26,87],"tags":[694,108,716,153,309,501],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6024"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=6024"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6024\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=6024"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=6024"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=6024"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
