(This is the equivalent and as big a deal as Google Fiber setting up for the first time in Kansas City, KS, in 2011). Part of what&#8217;s interesting about this is that Sky and TalkTalk are telecom competitors but they both have to buy access to the pipes from a third competitor, BT, and now they are skipping it. The identity for UFO has been designed by London-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.venturethree.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">venturethree<\/a>\n<!--more--><blockquote>Our task was to create a stand-alone brand that&#8217;s neutral from the two brands behind it, but powered by them for credibility. Introducing&#8230; UltraFibreOptic. UFO. Something so fast it can keep up with 1000Mb of fibre power.<br \/><br \/>The UltraFibreOptic proposition is simple &#8212; &#8216;do more of what you love doing online, together&#8217;. And because the joint venture is such a modern way of operating collaboratively, we positioned it as &#8216;a Sky + TalkTalk idea&#8217;. In a crowded marketplace the &#8216;idea&#8217; element helps differentiate the two businesses as creative thinkers, doers and leaders.<br \/><br \/>The creative concept comes straight from the name &#8212; UFO. The actual product is light so it follows that everything UFO says and does is powered by light. It&#8217;s a refreshing look for a completely new category full of possibilities.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.venturethree.com\/clients\/sky\/more-speed-more-possibilities\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">venturethree project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ufo_logo_detail.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Ultra Fibre Optic by venturethree\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>I usually have a sense of how most projects are going to be received by our readers but this one&hellip; I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s going to be hated or appreciated. I have mixed reactions myself. I like the name and how it shortens to UFO but I also think naming something UFO is kind of silly and even more so when the logo is just a UFO. There is no leap in concept from name to visual. It&#8217;s not like a good logo can&#8217;t be a literal interpretation of its name, but here there is nothing furthering the notion of what the service is. <em>However<\/em>, I&#8217;m a big fan of shiny things and I really like the shiny, glossy, bulbous UFO chosen as the visual representation to be taken to our leader. It&#8217;s like the start-up version of <em>Big Hero 6<\/em>&#8216;s <a href=\"http:\/\/disney.wikia.com\/wiki\/Baymax\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Baymax<\/a>. The wordmark is set in Miles Newlyn&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.textpref.com\/try#familyId=6&#038;fontId=27\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TP Rubrik<\/a> and it works as a great visual bridge between the Sky and TalkTalk logos. I&#8217;m not a big fan of the bolded initials but I can understand they wanted to play up the acronym.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/128059638?color=f04923&#038;title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Motion spot.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The logo is at its best when animated, slowly rotating and toying with reflection, along with a cool sound signature that gives the logo a nice boost of speed.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ufo_ad_landing_soon.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Ultra Fibre Optic by venturethree\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ufo_ad_landed.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Ultra Fibre Optic by venturethree\" \/>\n<figcaption>Billboards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ufo_ad_bus_stop.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Ultra Fibre Optic by venturethree\" \/>\n<figcaption>Bus stop ad.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/128059925?color=f04923&#038;title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"500\" height=\"889\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Animated bus stop.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ufo_posters.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Ultra Fibre Optic by venturethree\" \/>\n<figcaption>Posters.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ufo_balloon.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Ultra Fibre Optic by venturethree\" \/>\n<figcaption>Balloon.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">In application, there isn&#8217;t much and what&#8217;s there is not stellar. The bright lights shining from behind the letters in the bus ad start to feel cheesy and like a bad sci-fi movie and the service&#8217;s website adds to the cheapened look with all its beveled buttons, gradients, and lens flares. The mock-up of the wheat paste posters is kind of cool but, as mock-ups to show potential, it would have been cool to see the UFO going from top to bottom as the posters progressed so that, in theory, as you drive or walk by the UFO is landing. The ballon UFO fits in the &#8220;ooooh shiny&#8221; category but also on the &#8220;why?&#8221; question pile. Overall, bonus points for a fun logo but the system crashed on entering the atmosphere &mdash; or to put it in less metaphorical terms, the brand&#8217;s debut needed to be handled in a much more streamlined, elegant, and cohesive way.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Launched today, Ultra Fibre Optic (UFO) is a joint venture by Sky and TalkTalk to bring 1000Mb ultrafast fibre broadband to the UK, debuting in the city of York.
