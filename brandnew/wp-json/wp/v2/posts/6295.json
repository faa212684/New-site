Headquartered in Stockholm, Sweden, Ericsson has over 100,000 employees &#8212; 24,000 of which are in R&amp;D, which has yielded the company 42,000 patents. This week, at Mobile World Congress 2018, Ericsson introduced a revised icon designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.stockholmdesignlab.se\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Stockholm Design Lab<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>The geometry of the new, optimized Econ has been refined to align smoothly and naturally with the pixel grid. Its angle, curvature and spacing have all been adjusted for knife-sharp performance in digital environments. While each refinement is practically invisible to the naked eye, the end result is a noticeable smoother on-screen rendering &#8211; especially at smaller sizes. The Econ&#8217;s inclination angle, 18.435\u00b0, has been fine-tuned to harmonize with the pixel grid. The new improved angle ensures a uniform pixel distribution, which in turn means smoothly rendered edges.<\/blockquote><h3>Stockholm Design Lab provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ericsson_econ_before_after_comparison.gif\" alt=\"New Icon and Identity for Ericsson by Stockholm Design Lab\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icon comparison, before and after.

So, yes, no one will notice but this gives Ericsson the confidence that their logo will look as good as possible in as many places as possible. The three-pixel grayscale smoothing at the lowest-pixel-count rendering of the icon is one of the most enjoyable design-nerdery things I have seen in a while, especially given how easy it is for logos to degrade when they go small. Check <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ericsson.com\/favicon.ico\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">their favicon<\/a>&#8230; it&#8217;s kind of spectacular how sharp it looks. So, no, no one will notice but that doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s not an improvement and an investment for the next 20, 30 years.<\/p>\n<p>In all of this, I&#8217;m not sure what happens to the Ericsson wordmark. It all seems a push to use it less and less.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/plugins\/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fericsson%2Fvideos%2F1748421385214608%2F&#038;show_text=0&#038;width=560\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowTransparency=\"true\" allowFullScreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Weird video but showing logo animation at the beginning.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>Hilda is a modern typeface designed around the user experience.

The tones we have selected are digitally native, intentionally bright and rich in contrast. The accent colors are primarily intended to help guide the user towards key messages and interactions, rather than distract them through unnecessary decorative usage.

The visual language takes direct influence from the products and services needs, with little space for ambiguity and meaningless decoration. The holistic design work includes optimization of the entire visual system, with the purpose of simplifying and adapting to today&#8217;s and tomorrow&#8217;s digital needs for customers.

I may be wrong in this but I don&#8217;t think the Ericsson icon is as universally recognizable as, say, Apple&#8217;s or even LG&#8217;s since it doesn&#8217;t have a major consumer market presence but this new system and approach could play a role in getting it closer to a more iconic business-to-business brand like IBM &#8212; and all because of a 18.435\u00b0 angle.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1876, Ericsson provides hardware, software, and services for communications technology having developed many of the technologies that have enabled 2G, 3G, and 4G networks, currently working on 5G and the growing world of the Internet of Things.
