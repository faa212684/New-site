The new identity, designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lowebrindfors.se\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lowe Brindfors<\/a> took cues from the Art Deco building of Folkoperan to deliver a quirky-yet-serious typographic wordmark that looks great rendered as large as possible in applications. An accompanying bird is the new icon for the opera and it is one moody SOB, going from happy to sad to angry in the span of an animated GIF (see link). The red bursts of red add some drama to the identity. It&#8217;s not over &rsquo;til the angry bird tweets! <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lowebrindfors.se\/work\/new-graphic-profile\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Habibis by Anagrama<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_tacosarabes.png\" alt=\"Habibis by Anagrama\"\/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">Nothing beats a good mash-up and here it starts with the product: Mexican tacos meet Arab cuisine for this northern Mexico taco stand-turned-establishment, Habibis. Designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.anagrama.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Anagrama<\/a>, the identity goes for the dangerous route of creating Latin characters out of the style of another writing system &mdash; an approach that usually goes awry. But here, the calligraphic spirit of the Arabic alphabet has been wonderfully interpreted and the elegant letters mashed-up against kraft paper and fluorescent green stickers makes for a great combination. There is a third element in the black-and-white pattern boxes inspired by keffiyeh scarf but it seems like that belongs on another project all its own. Still: Tacos arabes? Want! <a href=\"http:\/\/www.anagrama.com\/portafolio\/151-habibis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Dalaco by Believe In<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_dalaco.jpg\" alt=\"Dalaco by Believe In\"\/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">In other bird-related news: Exeter, UK-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.believein.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Believe In<\/a> has chosen a lark &mdash; &#8220;the classic English songbird that heralds the dawning of a new day&#8221; as they explain &mdash; to represent <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dalaco.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dalaco<\/a>, designers, manufacturers, and distributors of cufflinks and other accessories to jewelers. The bird drawing is handsome, manly, and elegant, even more so against the muted dark blue backgrounds and pin-stripe pattern. I don&#8217;t know if it would be any better or worse but I keep wanting the icon to be flipped so that it reads like a &#8220;D&#8221;, but maybe I&#8217;m just being a <u>d<\/u>ork. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.believein.co.uk\/#\/work\/showcase\/dalaco-brand-identity\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"We are putting a bird on it, twice, this week with work from Stockholm, Monterrey, and Exeter&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[965,741,564],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2827"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2827"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2827\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2827"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2827"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2827"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
