It provides networking and learning opportunities for its members as well as lobbying on behalf of the industry in various aspects. BIMA also manages the BIMA Awards and a Hall of Fame. Last month, BIMA introduced a new identity designed by Leeds, UK-based <a href=\"http:\/\/onlystudio.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Only<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>The previous BIMA identity was rooted in the past and limited in influence beyond the inaugural BIMA Awards. The cornerstone of BIMA&#8217;s new identity is their redesigned logotype.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/onlystudio.co.uk\/work\/bima-rebrand\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Only project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bima_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for BIMA by Only\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The previous logo had a decent idea, with the mouse cursor appearing in the counterspace of a community-conveying ribbon. It was even well done, as far as infinitely-looping ribbons go and the slab serif wordmark was okay if a little too lowercase. I doubt any digital professional wants to be represented by an organization with a quaint cursor, since a big part of the digital experience happens without one and it&#8217;s all about our opposing thumb&#8217;s swiping ability. The new logo drops the cursor, the slab serifs, and pretty much any other recognizable trait in favor of a super dry, uppercase logo. Talk about WYSIWYG. Luckily, there is a tad more to the identity and the applications are crisply executed because otherwise this is as unimpressive as it gets.<\/p>\n<blockquote>The top left corner of the &#8216;B&#8217; is extrapolated to form a responsive framing device that can flex and adapt to fit any given application. The three points of the frame represent the three pillars of activity that underpin everything that BIMA does &#8212; championing, connecting and developing the industry.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/onlystudio.co.uk\/work\/bima-rebrand\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Only project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bima_logo_extensions.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for BIMA by Only\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo extensions.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bima_guidelines_01.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for BIMA by Only\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bima_guidelines_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for BIMA by Only\" \/>\n<figcaption>Guidelines.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bima_stationery.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for BIMA by Only\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stationery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bima_business_card.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for BIMA by Only\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business card.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The main saving grace of the identity is the corner frame taken from the &#8220;B&#8221;, which isn&#8217;t the most original of graphic devices but is well played here in red and always placed on the corner of the applications. (I&#8217;m sure down the road they will realize what a pain in the ass that decision might be as the perfectly even corner on digital files will get trimmed in all kinds of uneven ways in actual production.)<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bima_books.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for BIMA by Only\" \/>\n<figcaption>Books of some kind.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bima_poster.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for BIMA by Only\" \/>\n<figcaption>Poster.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bima_award.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for BIMA by Only\" \/>\n<figcaption>BIMA Awards award.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bima_icons.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for BIMA by Only\" \/>\n<figcaption>BIMA Awards category icons.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bima_mobile.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for BIMA by Only\" \/>\n<figcaption>Mobile.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">The frame also works well as a corner of a full frame to, well, frame headlines or as the focal point of icons. The typography in general is quite nice, typeset in Klim Type Foundry&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/klim.co.nz\/retail-fonts\/calibre\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Calibre<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/klim.co.nz\/retail-fonts\/tiempos-text\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tiempos<\/a>. Overall, it&#8217;s an elegant identity that gives the organization more of a high-end advertising club vibe that replaces the more cheesy look seen in <a href=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20160131035433\/http:\/\/www.bima.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">their previous website iteration<\/a>.
