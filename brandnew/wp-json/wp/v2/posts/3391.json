It&#8217;s fun to look at, it&#8217;s colorful, it ties in to the more recognizable brand asset that is the Rio 2016 typeface, and it has some landmark references hidden in it, but&hellip; it&#8217;s kind of very weird and ambiguous as well. As a single piece of design and illustration it&#8217;s enjoyable but as a basis for what is usually one of the most complex identity programs in the history of things it seems like an odd place to start.<\/p>\n<blockquote>Developed by teams of design and management of the Rio 2016 brand, the project took about a year to complete. For its development, studies of historical-cultural and identity present in the Brazil Rio de Janeiro and a photographic immersion in the landscape aspects of the region were performed, in addition to four other cities Soccer &#8211; Belo Horizonte, Sao Paulo, Brasilia and Salvador.<br \/><br \/>According to the team responsible for the project, which was developed internally, Rio de Janeiro is present in the scenario through your icons, in which is recognized throughout Brazil and that inhabit the imagination of every tourist. The look is organic and immersive &#8220;like a hug&#8221;, inspired by the exuberant nature and warmth.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.rio2016.com\/noticias\/noticias\/rio-2016-revela-o-look-dos-jogos-a-dois-anos-da-cerimonia-olimpica-de-abertura\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rio 2016 press release<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/rio_2016_look_city_icons.jpg\" alt=\"New Look of the Games for Rio 2016 done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>&#8220;Football town&#8221; icons.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The above icons show the positive potential of this language, though.

Obviously these are early renderings and proof of concept &mdash; things tend to look far cooler in reality. Still, it feels flat. The Rio 2016 look reminds me slightly of the <a href=\"http:\/\/graphicambient.com\/2012\/07\/14\/vancouver-winter-olympics-2010-canada\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympic Games look<\/a> but with warmer colors and less ambition (for the time being).<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/hsuzs_tJqxQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>In case you missed it: The type of the games, designed by Dalton Maag.
