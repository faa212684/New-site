Over the years &mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cadillacfaq.com\/faq\/answers\/caddylogoredesign.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a> you may find an interesting article about the previous redesign and a summary of all logos &mdash; the logo has evolved ever more minimal, dropping the ducks and crown from the original, arriving at a stealth-looking logo in 1999, the year of the last redesign.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cadillac_logo_detail.jpg\" alt=\"Cadillac Logo, Detail\" \/><\/p>\n<p>There is no press release and the new logo is not even on the Cadillac web site, but <a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/cadillac\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">its Facebook page<\/a> merrily sports the new logo and the latest campaign, &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=m0te5pU_3qk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">May the Best Car Win<\/a>,&#8221; from its parent company, GM, signs off with the new logo.

It took me a few minutes to confirm that the new one was indeed the new one, since it looks like a step back, or at least a step away from relative simplicity. The old one felt more like stainless steel and the new one like a metallic crown filling or, put less graphically, cheap. The texture in the coat of arms is kind of interesting and it has been executed much better than the wreath for sure but it feels overly detailed. The old emblem is something that would look great on an Escalade, the new emblem should probably be run over by one.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to Alex Donegan for the tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_20091009_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_20091009_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"574\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[59,9,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/944"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=944"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/944\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=944"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=944"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=944"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
