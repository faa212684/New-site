Some big primetime hits for ABC have included <em>Lost<\/em>, <em>Grey&#8217;s Anatomy<\/em>, <em>Who Wants to be a Millionaire<\/em> and plenty of other successes (and failures). Late this Spring, ABC introduced a revised logo and new on-air look designed by New York, NY-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.loyalkaspar.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Loyalkaspar<\/a>.

Network TV logos are so overdecorated that it didn&#8217;t raise any eyebrows. But when compared to the new softer look &mdash; which is still drenched in far more gradients and shines that Mr. Rand ever expected &mdash; the old logo looks almost comical.<\/p>\n<p><p>If we assume that gradients are a must for ABC, then this is one of the better executions we will see. There is some purpose to it and the color variants give it an extra boost in moodiness. My only complaint would be that the top left part of the logo seems to me made from a shinier and more reflective material than the bottom right section that is more matte. Going back to Paul Rand&#8217;s typography and proportions is a cute homage and makes a small difference, although nothing the larger populace will ever notice, but a pat on the back for the nod to history.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/abc_2013_modern_typeface.png\" alt=\"New Logo and On-air Look for ABC by Loyalkaspar\" \/>\n<figcaption>Custom type family, ABC Modern.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/abc_2013_logo_for_shows.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and On-air Look for ABC by Loyalkaspar\" \/>\n<figcaption>The logo and colors assigned to specific shows.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/abc_2013_logo_for_shows_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and On-air Look for ABC by Loyalkaspar\" \/>\n<figcaption>In use.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">In application, with the use of the new ABC Modern typeface, which has an interesting bluntness to it, gives the identity some edge and makes it feel contemporary without having to try too hard.
