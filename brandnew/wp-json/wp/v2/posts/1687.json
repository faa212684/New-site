The museum houses more than 42,000 objects that span American, Asian, Modern and Contemporary, and Native American Arts, as well as photography and silver. In September the Portland Art Museum introduced a new identity designed by Portland-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ziba.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ziba<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>Based on this research, a brand strategy was developed to reflect the essence of the institution. Ziba&#8217;s design team created a visual identity that clearly communicates the many facets of the Museum. The iconic anchor for the new mark is a large, bold, &#8220;P&#8221; that serves as a portal &mdash; a window &mdash; into the Museum. In its application, the collections, exhibitions, and programs will be framed.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.portlandartmuseum.org\/about\/news\/releases\/Portland-Art-Museum-Unveils-New-Brand\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press Release<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pam_logo_detail.jpg\" alt=\"Portland Art Museum\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The previous logo was actually pretty interesting with a smart combination of a traditional serif with a jarringly bold sans serif lacking counters that, together, spelled out the whole name. I&#8217;m sure it caused some confusion since you either read &#8220;Portland Museum. Art.&#8221; or &#8220;Art. Portland Museum.&#8221; but I still like how it dared to not be straightforward. The new logo, whether intended or not, is a good evolution from those counterless characters through the use of a towering, counterless &#8220;P&#8221; supported by a nicely contrasting condensed sans serif to spell out the whole name, highlighting the word &#8220;Art&#8221; in a way reminiscent of the old logo. The final configuration is contemporary and bold &mdash; perhaps not terribly groundbreaking, but something the museum should be proud of.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pam_ps.jpg\" alt=\"Portland Art Museum\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Then we have the good ol&#8217; logo-as-window approach. I think we are reaching a point where as much as we need to ask &#8220;Will it fax?&#8221; we need to start asking &#8220;Will it function as a window?&#8221;. It&#8217;s starting to become a bit of a clich&eacute; but we have to admit that that&#8217;s because the approach not only sells amazingly with clients but works visually well 99% of the time. And in this case, since the holding shape is so big, it works especially well. Again, nothing we haven&#8217;t seen before, but it&#8217;s nicely done.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pam_covers.jpg\" alt=\"Portland Art Museum\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to Cliff Little for first tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_111020_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_111020_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_111020_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_111020_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,63,26],"tags":[327,206,639],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1687"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1687"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1687\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1687"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1687"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1687"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
