And pizza. And hamburgers. If this sounds (and looks) vaguely familiar it&#8217;s because it&#8217;s from the same company as Roll Club (that was in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_241.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Friday Likes 241<\/a>) and also designed by Kharkov, Ukraine-based <a href=\"http:\/\/canape.ua\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Canape<\/a>. Admittedly, this one isn&#8217;t as cool as Roll Club but it displays the same kind of eclectic aesthetic and kinetic energy in mixing a number of graphic elements in fun, bold designs. The logo is a set of chopsticks with a line uniting them to make a fish, which is kind of endearing. The Wi-Fi-signal-looking icon are meant to be fish scales and it&#8217;s accompanied by big red rising suns. The typography is not super great but the french fry box alone is worth a Friday Like. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/69034893\/Watatsumi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Bar Douro by Studio91 Design<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_bardouro.jpg\" alt=\"Bar Douro by Studio91 Design\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bardouro.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bar Douro<\/a> is a Portuguese restaurant in London, UK. The identity, designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.studio91design.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Studio91 Design<\/a>, references Portugal&#8217;s classic blue tiles &#8212; which adorn the interior of the restaurant &#8212; through a blue and white color palette and a modular wordmark that looks just as good horizontally as it does vertically <em>as<\/em> it does on a curve. It&#8217;s a fairly straightforward logo but the custom letterforms have a great look and its integration into everything from plates to ghost sign to tissue paper pattern is quite nice. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/63009811\/Bar-Douro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Soren West by TR\u00dcF<\/h1>\n<div class=\"video-container\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.25%\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_sorenwest.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/trufcreative.com\/work\/soren-west\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Soren West<\/a>, in Los Angeles, CA, develops original entertainment properties and experiential programming for brand partners, real estate holders, and investors. Their logo, designed by Santa Monica, CA-based <a href=\"http:\/\/trufcreative.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TR\u00dcF<\/a> is what attracted me to this project, executed with utter simplicity to make an abstract &#8220;S&#8221; out of two circles. I know it&#8217;s not a showstopper but it has a lovely Mid-century Modern aesthetic as well as old-, old-school logo construction. It has a couple of great animations at the link and some cool patterns for the business cards. My only complaint is there aren&#8217;t more applications to show. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/62930789\/SOREN-WEST\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Some combos of simplicity and exuberance this week, with work from Kharkov, London, and Santa Monica&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[66,11,85,26],"tags":[337,769,564,748],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6801"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=6801"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6801\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=6801"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=6801"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=6801"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
