McDonald Germany&#8217;s VP, Holger Beeck, stated that the move is &#8220;out of respect for the environment.&#8221; But Germany isn&#8217;t the first to go green, France has been leading the European greening since 2006, when it launched the internal <em>L&#8217;Eco Journal<\/em> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mcdonalds.fr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">its web site<\/a> now features the logo against said deep green. This move is part of a bigger effort by McDonald&#8217;s to actually be green philosophically, more than just aesthetically, as chronicled in the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.crmcdonalds.com\/publish\/csr\/home\/about\/environmental_responsibility\/best_of_green.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">McDonald&#8217;s 2009 Global Best of Green<\/a> report. There are a couple of items for discussion: <em>a)<\/em> Is literally going green too lame? And <em>b)<\/em> does it hurt the brand by moving away from the very recognizable red? My take is, on the former, yes it&#8217;s kind of lame but at least they picked a nice green and, on the latter, McDonald&#8217;s has such a broad palette of brand icons &mdash; from the mnemonic Parapapapa sound to the Big Mac to the yellow arches &mdash; that substituting red is no big deal&hellip; in fact, just look how cool <em>and<\/em> recognizable it looks against black in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mcdonalds.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the U.S. web site<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.zlok.net\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Yves<\/a> for first tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/980"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=980"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/980\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=980"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=980"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=980"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
