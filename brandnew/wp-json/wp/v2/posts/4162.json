There is too much to be said about Victoria and Melbourne so in the interest of time I will skip it and perhaps you would be inclined to read through all the material provided by the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.vic.gov.au\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">State Government of Victoria<\/a> website, the  <a href=\"http:\/\/corporate.visitvictoria.com\/about-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Visit Victoria<\/a> website, or the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.visitmelbourne.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Visit Melbourne<\/a> website, whose job is to tell you all about it &mdash; now in a cohesive, branded manner.

The new logos hinge around a &#8220;V&#8221; for Victoria which does not rank high in terms of surprising solutions and the execution would have to be great to make this stand out. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s not. There is nothing evidently wrong with it, but the elements never quite gel. The &#8220;V&#8221; in &#8220;VICTORIA&#8221; aligns nicely with the triangle but the &#8220;C&#8221; does not sit comfortably in there and the rest of the letters feel excluded. The State Government logo sort of works better by filling in that odd bottom area with some type. The Melbourne logo does not work at all in the triangle. This is a hard logo system to pull off convincingly and, well, I&#8217;m not convinced.<\/p>\n<p>(As an aside, the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.melbourne.vic.gov.au\/Pages\/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">City of Melbourne<\/a> logo by Landor remains in place).<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/uorsJWIThX4\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Introduction to the new brand.

The patterns in the triangle only add noise and there is no real integration. The &#8220;This Vic&#8221;, &#8220;That Vic&#8221;, &#8220;Everybody Vic&#8221; applications are visually awkward and if you say them out loud it&#8217;s not quite the destination poetry they were aiming for. (Perhaps the &#8220;Surf Vic&#8221; image is successful but a sexy image of the beach will do that). The applications with the angle dividing a layout look fine but are far from innovative or original. Overall, this is all well presented, thought out, and, on the surface, it looks decent but there isn&#8217;t anything here that makes me want to stop what I&#8217;m doing and go to Victoria or Melbourne but if I ever do, at least I will know that the State and tourism logos will be the same and provide some kind of peace of mind that I&#8217;m not in a lawless territory where each entity has their own logo.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Located on the south-east of Australia, Victoria is the state with the second biggest population in the country with Melbourne, its capital, being Victoria&apos;s biggest metropolis.
