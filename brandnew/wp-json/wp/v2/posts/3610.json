The hub is housed in a new building that features an <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Oculus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">oculus<\/a> conceived by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jcdainc.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">James Carpenter Design Associates<\/a>. Your best bet to appreciate it instead of me trying to explain it is to Google-image-it by its nickname, &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=Sky+Reflector-Net&#038;lr=lang_en&#038;tbs=lr:lang_1en&#038;source=lnms&#038;tbm=isch&#038;sa=X&#038;ei=BLFqVLLfNImdyQSVqILwBQ&#038;ved=0CAoQ_AUoAw&#038;biw=1539&#038;bih=866\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sky Reflector-Net<\/a>&#8220;. The new logo for Fulton Center has been designed by New York-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pentagram.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pentagram<\/a> partner Michael Bierut.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>The underlying form of the Fulton Center logo is inspired by the architecture of the building: the interaction of a square and a circle. Eleven converging, crossing, and swirling lines represent the connections made at the station. (Specifically, the 2, 3, 4, 5, A, C, E, J, N, R and Z trains.) The lines evoke the movement and activity of the transit hub, and are reflective of the view of the oculus and <em>Sky Reflector-Net<\/em>. The circular form of the logo also echoes the circles of the subway line emblems and the MTA identity.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/new.pentagram.com\/2014\/11\/new-work-fulton-center\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pentagram project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fulton_center_logo_angle.png\" alt=\"New Logo for Fulton Center by Pentagram\" \/>\n<figcaption>The holding shape is rotated 5 degrees, representing the five subway lines that converge at the hub.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fulton_center_logo_colors.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Fulton Center by Pentagram\" \/>\n<figcaption>Color variations for each season.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Leaving no decision unexplained &mdash; 11 concentric lines for the 11 subway trains that stop there and 5-degree tilt for the 5 lines that these 11 trains operate in &mdash; this logo is as beautiful and eye-catching as the new building. Relatively speaking, of course: the building is a multi-million-dollar project consisting of a 79-foot-high net imbued with 952 reflective diamond-shape panels while the logo is a probably a modest-multi-thousand-dollar logo with, at most, 50 bezier points. But you get the point.<\/p>\n<p>The logo looks great at big and small sizes and I feel like this is one of the rare occasions where the gradient makes the logo better, although it works just as nice in single color. Set in Christian Schwartz&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.myfonts.com\/fonts\/linotype\/neue-haas-grotesk\/?refby=ucllc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Neue Haas Grotesk<\/a>, the typography could use some breathing room instead of the negative tracking they used. That &#8220;u&#8221; and &#8220;l&#8221; look like train passengers during rush hour.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fulton_center_logo_extrusion.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Fulton Center by Pentagram\" \/>\n<figcaption>Signage version of the logo.

Case in point: the transit card shown above, where the logo is just&hellip; placed there. Maybe because Fulton Center also has retail the logo will be treated with good care and attention. Nonetheless, this is a pretty logo that should help make the previously dire journey of connecting subway trains in lower Manhattan a more pleasant experience.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Inaugurated this past weekend, Fulton Center is a new transit hub of New York&apos;s Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) located in lower Manhattan that connects eleven subway lines as well as connections to the PATH train system.
