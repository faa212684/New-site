In December of 2012 it was announced that the Hornets would change their name to the Pelicans and last week the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nba.com\/hornets\/new-orleans-pelicans-logos-unveiled\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">New Orleans Pelicans<\/a> unveiled their new identity designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/raredesign.com\/new-orleans-pelicans-soaring-to-new-heights\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">RARE<\/a>, self-described as &#8220;one of the most esteemed branding agencies in the country.&#8221; (First time I hear of them).<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>The Pelicans will be more than a namesake for the franchise, as New Orleans, the State of Louisiana and the Gulf South have a rich history connected to the name. Represented on Louisiana&#8217;s state flag and seal, the Pelican has been the state bird for over a century. The Pelican symbolizes the determination to not only survive, but thrive even when the odds are stacked against them as our region has demonstrated over and over.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nba.com\/hornets\/news\/benson-family-unveils-new-orleans-pelicans-colors-and-logos\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press Release<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/new_orleans_pelicans_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Orleans Pelicans Logo\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/new_orleans_pelicans_logo_all.png\" alt=\"New Orleans Pelicans Logo\" \/><\/p>\n<blockquote>The Pelicans&#8217; colors will be blue, gold and red. The team&#8217;s primary color, blue, is taken from Louisiana&#8217;s state flag. The Pelicans and Saints will share the color gold, uniting the organizations, while celebrating the spirited life of New Orleans and its many celebrations (gold is also a commonly found color on the &#8220;crown&#8221; of the pelican). Red represents fraternity and is indicative of the blood provision of the mother pelican and the vibrant color underneath the pelican&#8217;s throat. All three colors are found on the City of New Orleans flag.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nba.com\/hornets\/news\/benson-family-unveils-new-orleans-pelicans-colors-and-logos\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press Release<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p>When it was first announced that &#8220;Pelicans&#8221; would be the name I thought it was a rather silly choice. Not because it didn&#8217;t make sense &mdash; see the first quote and watch <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nba.com\/hornets\/new-orleans-pelicans-logos-unveiled\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the un-embed-able movie at the top here<\/a> to see why it makes so much sense culturally &mdash; but because I didn&#8217;t consider a pelican to be a rather intimidating animal like other NBA teams a la Bulls, Grizzlies, or even Hornets. Plus, they are rather goofy-looking animals. And perhaps because of those preconceptions the Pelicans had to go with an extremely pissed off pelican, which looks remarkably good. By avoiding a profile shot of the pelican they were able to get past that awkward beak shape and by using a front-view they could also place focus on the wings, which are always a good visual device to work with. The drawing of the main pelican is impeccable: minimal details, bold shapes, and Gestalten-ish. The typography is a nice respite from the pointy serifs of sports logos and is well executed too, although the &#8220;N&#8221; and &#8220;S&#8221; look a little wobbly there at the edges.<\/p>\n<p>The alternate logos are quite smart too, incorporating a crescent in the circular logo and the fleur-de-lis in the either geniously- or stupidly-named &#8220;Bird-de-Lis&#8221; which is also both the most awesome thing I&#8217;ve seen this year as well as the most comical. There is something so appealing and repelling about it at the same time.<\/p>\n<p>Overall, a surprisingly different logo within the realm of NBA logos that is city appropriate and looks and feels competitive.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/new_orleans_pelicans_photo_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Orleans Pelicans Logo\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/new_orleans_pelicans_photo_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Orleans Pelicans Logo\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nba.com\/hornets\/gallery\/new-orleans-pelicans-logo-unveiling\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">New Orleans Pelicans Logo Unveiling<\/a>.
