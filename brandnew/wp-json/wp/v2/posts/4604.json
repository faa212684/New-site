The heart of the Festival is at Walsh Bay in heritage wharves on Sydney Harbour. There are also events stretching across Sydney, from the Opera House and Sydney Town Hall, into suburban Sydney and the Blue Mountains. We bring together writers from various forms and backgrounds, including the best contemporary novelists, screenwriters, musicians and writers of cutting edge nonfiction, and some of the world&#8217;s leading public intellectuals, scientists and journalists. The Festival is a not-for-profit organisation, and as such, we aim to be accessible to a wide range of audiences.&#8221;<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sydney_writers_festival_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo for Sydney Writers&amp;apos; Festival by 18 Feet\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sydney_writers_festival_eventguide.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Sydney Writers&amp;apos; Festival by 18 Feet\" \/>\n<figcaption>Event guide.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sydney_writers_festival_harbor.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Sydney Writers&amp;apos; Festival by 18 Feet\" \/>\n<figcaption>Outside the launch event.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/SyUK4F9RyGE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Festival promotion animation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"(Est. 1997) &quot;Each year, Sydney Writers&apos; Festival presents over 300 events, attracting audiences of 100,000 to our gorgeous harbourside location and other venues.
