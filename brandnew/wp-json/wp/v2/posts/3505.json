The new logo, designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.stockholmdesignlab.se\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Stockholm Design Lab<\/a>, takes advantage of the serendipitous shape found on the facade of the two buildings: a martini glass. Brilliant, humorous, and Swedish as hell, the minimalist logo and Absolut-esque wordmark &mdash; the museum houses Absolut&#8217;s art collection &mdash; make for a great cocktail as the basis of the identity, which is then infused with a bunch of other eccentric visual approaches like chemical formulas, floating bubbles, giant plants, and more &mdash; perhaps even going too far in different directions. Nonetheless: they had me at incandescent-lit martini glass. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.stockholmdesignlab.se\/spritmuseum\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a> \/ <strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.rebrandblog.pl\/spritmuseum-czyli-zmiana-nazwy-i-identyfikacji\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A few more images<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Harlem EatUp! by OCD | Original Champions of Design<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_harlemeatup.gif\" alt=\"Harlem EatUp! by OCD | Original Champions of Design\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">Set to take place for the first time in May of 2015, <a href=\"http:\/\/harlemeatup.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Harlem EatUp!<\/a> will be a &#8220;four-day festival in Harlem, New York, celebrating the food, culture, and spirit of East, Central, and West Harlem.&#8221; The logo, literally cobbled together by New York-based <a href=\"http:\/\/originalchampionsofdesign.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">OCD | Original Champions of Design<\/a>, features modular typography and iconography that builds up, down, and sideways to create a joyous pattern that can accommodate diverse messaging and communication needs.
