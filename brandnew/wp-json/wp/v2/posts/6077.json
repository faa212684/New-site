A pinch of barley is then added during the distillation process to give it that malty, full-bodied depth, resulting in a subtle aftertaste that carries a hint of Holland&#8217;s national tipple Jenever &#8211; the birth mother of gin. A true fusion therefore of East and West &#8211; a Korean recipe literally given a Dutch spin.&#8221;<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/wihayo_icon.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for WIHAYO by Sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/wihayo_packaging_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for WIHAYO by Sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/wihayo_packaging_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for WIHAYO by Sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/wihayo_packaging_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for WIHAYO by Sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/wihayo_packaging_04.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for WIHAYO by Sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord\" \/>\n<figcaption>Packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video controls><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/wihayo_video.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Video introduction.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"(Est. 2015, launched 2017) &quot;WIHAYO is a unique soju made with a traditional Korean recipe and all natural ingredients &#8211; the difference and uniqueness of WIHAYO is the fact that its core ingredient, rice, is ground by one of the&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[51,12,25],"tags":[371,319,105,53,1465],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6077"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=6077"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6077\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=6077"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=6077"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=6077"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
