Designed by London-based <a href=\"http:\/\/sociodesign.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SocioDesign<\/a> the new logo is reminiscent of a wishbone and although chicken bones is not something one would associate with a fashion brand the logo is a beautiful, simple icon. Its tapering, thick-and-thin construction is what makes it work so well and pair perfectly with a matching wordmark (best appreciated at the link). The tan, salmon, and grays color palette serves as the perfect backdrop for some black foil stamping, giving everything an upscale feminine look.  <a href=\"http:\/\/sociodesign.co.uk\/twice-fashion\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">EDL by Bravo<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_edl.jpg\" alt=\"EDL by Bravo\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">Based in Singapore, <a href=\"\/\/edleuro.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">EDL<\/a> designs and manufactures high-end laminates for use by architects and interior designers. Designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/bravo.rocks\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bravo<\/a>, the logo has a very simple modular concept that hints at the modular panes of laminates offered by EDL. It&#8217;s not a groundbreaking logo but its simplicity and minimal use of elements yields an interesting wordmark that can handle any texture behind it. I particularly like the black on white application where the logo lands on top of some sexily embossed typography. <a href=\"http:\/\/bravo.rocks\/work\/edl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">ba.ro.co. by Studio Stefanowitsch<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_baroco.jpg\" alt=\"ba.ro.co. by Studio Stefanowitsch\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.baroco.de\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ba.ro.co<\/a>, short for Bavarian Roasting Company, is a small regional manufacturer of specialty coffee in Amberg, Germany.

Their first use is to create a short version of the name, from Bavarian Roasting Company to ba.ro.co, which is a clever way of making the name shorter and, heck, cooler. Their second use is to create a shorthand for the short name, from ba.ro.co to b&#8230; It&#8217;s like a fully thought out <a href=\"http:\/\/www.responsivelogos.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">&#8220;responsive&#8221; logo<\/a>, getting shorter as space is more limited but also getting cooler as desired.
