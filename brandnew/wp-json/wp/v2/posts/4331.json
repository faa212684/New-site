At the time, the launch was unceremonious and almost abrupt with no proper presence for the new company. Now, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise has its own full-fledged website and has launched a new campaign, created by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bbdo.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BBDO<\/a>, under the tagline of &#8220;Accelerating Next&#8221; while expanding on its identity, designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.siegelgale.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Siegel + Gale<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hp_enterprise_followup_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"Follow-up: Identity and Campaign for Hewlett-Packard Enterprise by Siegel + Gale and BBDO\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Back in April I expressed my appreciation for the new logo and now seeing it in other applications confirms my initial reaction. A stroked rectangle might not make for much of a logo in most circumstances but, here, the color and the proportion are what make it unique and memorable. More importantly, it establishes a distinct identity from the circular HP identity. Seeing the logo big above showcases the very nice sans serif used.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hp_enterprise_followup_stationery.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: Identity and Campaign for Hewlett-Packard Enterprise by Siegel + Gale and BBDO\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stationery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hp_enterprise_followup_brochure.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: Identity and Campaign for Hewlett-Packard Enterprise by Siegel + Gale and BBDO\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brochure.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hp_enterprise_followup_swag.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: Identity and Campaign for Hewlett-Packard Enterprise by Siegel + Gale and BBDO\" \/>\n<figcaption>Swag.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hp_enterprise_followup_server_boxes.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: Identity and Campaign for Hewlett-Packard Enterprise by Siegel + Gale and BBDO\" \/>\n<figcaption>Server box.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>(Applications above provided after the review was first written.

The rectangle can also be easy to misuse as in the ID card, where it loses elegance as a border. The logo is at its best when it&#8217;s looming big like that logo on scaffolding or the NYSE banner &mdash; it makes for a very fine corporate symbol.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Earlier this year I Noted the new logo for Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, which is the newly formed company that split from HP focusing on corporate hardware and services operations, leaving the consumer computer and printer business to the still-named HP.
