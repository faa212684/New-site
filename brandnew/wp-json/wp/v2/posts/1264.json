The Big Ten represents some of the leading teams in the country&hellip; as its name implies, it started with ten teams (University of Michigan, University of Wisconsin-Madison, University of Iowa, Indiana University, Ohio State University, Michigan State University, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, University of Minnesota, Northwestern University, and Purdue University), adding one in 1990 (Pennsylvania State University, which explains the &#8220;11&#8221; hidden in the original logo) and one more will begin play in 2011 (University of Nebraska-Lincoln). In terms of football and basketball, these are big deal teams with rabidly passionate fans so it comes as no surprise that the big story yesterday was the announcement of a new Big Ten identity <a href=\"http:\/\/pentagram.com\/en\/new\/2010\/12\/new-work-big-ten-conference-1.php#more\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">designed by Pentagram partners Michael Bierut and Michael Gericke<\/a>.<!--more--><blockquote>&#8220;The new Big Ten logo was developed to symbolize the conference&#8217;s future, as well as its rich heritage, strong tradition of competition, academic leadership, and passionate alumni,&#8221; said Gericke. &#8220;Its contemporary collegiate lettering includes an embedded numeral &#8220;10&#8221; in the word &#8220;BIG,&#8221; which allows fans to see &#8220;BIG&#8221; and &#8220;10&#8221; in a single word. Memorable and distinctive, the new logo evolved from the previous logo&#8217;s use of negative space and is built on the conference&#8217;s iconic name, without reference to the number of member institutions.&#8221;<br \/><br \/>The new logo also provides the flexibility of multiple versions which can be used horizontally, vertically and within new media.<br \/><br \/>&#8220;The new Big Ten logo provides a contemporary identifying mark unifying 12 outstanding institutions,&#8221; said Delany. &#8220;It conveys some elements from the past while simultaneously introducing new features. We think the new logo is fun and has something for everyone.&#8221;<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bigten.org\/newlogo\/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press Release<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/big10_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"Big Ten\" \/><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m the most perceptive or clever person in the world but, literally, the instant I saw the logo I read &#8220;Big 10&#8221;. It wasn&#8217;t difficult or complicated. When you are within the context of collegiate sports, the word &#8220;Big&#8221; is Gestaltingly followed by &#8220;Ten.&#8221; The connection is immediate. And this logo achieves that by using a &#8220;1&#8221; instead of an &#8220;I&#8221; to create the visual bridge. For other people the visual puzzle is not so evident &mdash; one of the comments I read somewhere asked &#8220;why is there a 1 in the word big?&#8221; The solution here is simple, bold and clever. Perhaps not everyone&#8217;s cup of tea (or plastic cup of beer) but at least it&#8217;s a logo that demands consideration.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/big10_logo_stacked.gif\" alt=\"Big Ten\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Where the identity feels more weak is in the full &#8220;Big Ten&#8221; version of the logo. Once you have figured out the trick, it&#8217;s impossible not to read the above as &#8220;Big 10 Ten.&#8221; In extended form, it loses some of its spunk and becomes more of a visual wall of impenetrable slab serifs. Not a bad thing in my book, but not entirely pleasing either.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/big10_Court.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ten\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/big10_field.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ten\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/big10_legends_leaders.gif\" alt=\"Big Ten\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Another big part of the story was the announcement of divisions within the conference that will only apply to football teams. The division names are &#8220;Legends&#8221; and &#8220;Leaders.&#8221; The Big Ten bigwigs probably felt like this was the equivalent of a rushing touchdown all the way back from yard 20 but, really, it&#8217;s more like a field goal that goes clunk against the pole. I&#8217;m not a college football fan so these very proud, gung-ho names are fairly off-putting to me and it sounds like even for people that actually care they are not that amusing either.<\/p>\n<p>The evolution of this identity is very successful because it&#8217;s simple and, more importantly, it can recede into the background to let each team&#8217;s identity be the main attraction but it still has enough standing power on its own to be recognizable in all those lucratively licensed television broadcasts in the major networks.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.marktimemedia.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Michelle Schulp<\/a> for very first tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_101214_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_101214_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_101214_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_101214_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,26,87],"tags":[292,268,270,134,411],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1264"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1264"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1264\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1264"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1264"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1264"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
