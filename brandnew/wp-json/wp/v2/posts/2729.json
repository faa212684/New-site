Work that we are pretty proud of and feel turned out really good. So you will have to indulge us and, in exchange, we will indulge you by being the target of our own audience&#8217;s infamous commentary. To summarize what you are about to see: This is the identity and related materials to our most recent conference designed by me and my partner Bryony for 455 attendees in New York, a few hundred web streamers, and the hundreds of others who have willingly (or not so willingly) followed our process over the last six months. This is an extra long post.<\/p>\n<!--more--><h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Logo<\/h1>\n<p>When I did the first draft of the logo I tweeted something along the lines of &#8220;the #BNConf identity is going to make people mad&#8221;. And it did. I received more than a handful of WTFs by e-mail about it and throughout the comments in the last month as we posted various announcements about the conference people have called it ugly and hideous. And that is perfectly fine. The point of this logo was to be uncomfortable and different (not in a good way). I explained the logo in detail on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnewconference\/about_the_identity.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this page<\/a> but I will summarize it here through the captions for each image.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/BN_Conf_2013_Identity_Case_Study_Hardcore_Sample_Logos.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2013 Brand New Conference by UnderConsideration\" \/>\n<figcaption>Our logo is inspired by the &#8220;Hardcore&#8221;, X-with-stuff-in-it trend best exemplified by this Tumblr: <a href=\"http:\/\/yourlogoisnothardcore.tumblr.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Your Logo is Not Hardcore<\/a>.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/BN_Conf_2013_Identity_Case_Study_Grid_construction.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2013 Brand New Conference by UnderConsideration\" \/>\n<figcaption>Based on the most basic, angular shapes of &#8220;B&#8221;, &#8220;N&#8221;, &#8220;C&#8221;, and &#8220;13&#8221; (shown on the left) and an X in the center, we created four versions of the logo that adhere strictly to a 10-by-10-pixel grid and each character is wedged into a triangle.

I hate Helvetica and I hate how it typesets but Christian&#8217;s cut is amazing, specially the Display styles. In order to establish some rules, we only used three different sizes throughout all the materials &mdash; except for the big posters. For the web we picked an H1 and a P style, and for print we turned the web&#8217;s P into an H2 and then introduced a much smaller P.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/BN_Conf_2013_Identity_Case_Study_Typography.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2013 Brand New Conference by UnderConsideration\" \/>\n<figcaption>The above is not 100% original size.

The trick was finding a way to translate the pixel grid unto print. Bryony had the idea of doing a grid die-cut on the cover and sewing the logos on the cover. I looked at her with a &#8220;You know you have to do 600 of these?&#8221; face but she said she could do it. After a lot of trials and tribulations of getting the cover laser-cut and scored, Bryony, indeed, went on to sew the logo on the cover. Six. Hundred. Times. <\/p>\n<p>The program was printed by Quantum Group in Chicago, IL using Neenah Paper. (Quantum and Neenah were both our presenting sponsors). We used, specifically:<br \/>\nBody: Neenah, CLASSIC CREST&reg;, Avalanche White, Smooth, 80 Text<br \/>\nJacket: Neenah, ROYAL SUNDANCE&reg;, Eclipse Black, 100 Cover<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/BN_Conf_2013_Identity_Case_Study_making_of_sewn_logo.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2013 Brand New Conference by UnderConsideration\" \/>\n<figcaption>Making of the program cover by sewing in the logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><iframe src=\"\/\/instagram.com\/p\/dmf18nkxw0\/embed\/\" width=\"612\" height=\"710\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowtransparency=\"true\"><\/iframe>\n<figcaption>In action.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>And here is the result.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/BN_Conf_2013_Photos_Materials_Program_01_Edit_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2013 Brand New Conference by UnderConsideration\" \/><hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/BN_Conf_2013_Photos_Materials_Program_02_Edit_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2013 Brand New Conference by UnderConsideration\" \/>\n<figcaption>Program covers.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/BN_Conf_2013_Photos_Materials_Program_00_Cover_Anim_Small.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2013 Brand New Conference by UnderConsideration\" \/>\n<figcaption>A sampling of different covers.

In the past we&#8217;ve done totes and, while cool, feel like a little too much. So we went with a simple paper bag that people would not feel too bad about throwing in the recycling bin and we wouldn&#8217;t have spent thousands of dollars in producing. We went with a white paper bag but it was too&hellip; white. So after we got the bags printed here in Austin with Industry Printshop we hand-dipped 600 bags in yellow paint to cover the handles. It&#8217;s a good thing we have a sizeable backyard for air drying.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/BN_Conf_2013_Identity_Case_Study_making_of_bag.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2013 Brand New Conference by UnderConsideration\" \/>\n<figcaption>Making of the yellow handles.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/BN_Conf_2013_Photos_Materials_Bags_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2013 Brand New Conference by UnderConsideration\" \/><hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/BN_Conf_2013_Photos_Materials_Bags_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2013 Brand New Conference by UnderConsideration\" \/><hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/BN_Conf_2013_Photos_Materials_Bags_04.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2013 Brand New Conference by UnderConsideration\" \/>\n<figcaption>The bags.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/BN_Conf_2013_Identity_Case_Study_Bags_Live_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2013 Brand New Conference by UnderConsideration\" \/>\n<figcaption>The bag, sitting pretty.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/BN_Conf_2013_Identity_Case_Study_Bags_Live_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2013 Brand New Conference by UnderConsideration\" \/>\n<figcaption>The bags.

Which did their job but were anything but memorable. Inspired by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=brooklyn+beta+badges&#038;source=lnms&#038;tbm=isch&#038;sa=X&#038;ei=ysA8UvumO6Lq2QXU8oG4CQ&#038;ved=0CAkQ_AUoAQ&#038;biw=1189&#038;bih=833&#038;dpr=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the Brooklyn Beta badges<\/a> we aimed to do something cooler, even if it meant spending more dollars on it. We purchased some really big sheets of yellow plexiglass and with a local group, MakeATX, that has a laser-cutter we did some tests and ended up with some snazzy badges. The names were printed on labels and adhered to the badge. Black, flat ribbon was put on each badge for the critical job of hanging from a neck.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/BN_Conf_2013_Photos_Materials_Badge_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2013 Brand New Conference by UnderConsideration\" \/><hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/BN_Conf_2013_Photos_Materials_Badge_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2013 Brand New Conference by UnderConsideration\" \/>\n<figcaption>The badges.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/BN_Conf_2013_Photos_Materials_Badge_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2013 Brand New Conference by UnderConsideration\" \/>\n<figcaption>The badge photographed against a big light.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/BN_Conf_2013_Identity_Case_Study_Badges_Live_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2013 Brand New Conference by UnderConsideration\" \/>\n<figcaption>Badges waiting for owners.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>One way we saw the &#8220;value&#8221; of the badges was by how many Instagrams of it people took. In the past, <em>no one<\/em> had taken an Instagram of their badge. So, even if it had a single, one-time use, the badge became, well, a badge of being part of the event.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/BN_Conf_2013_Identity_Case_Study_Bages_Instagram_small.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2013 Brand New Conference by UnderConsideration\" \/>\n<figcaption>Badges captured on Instagram.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Podium<\/h1>\n<p>No offense to the SVA Theatre but they have a fugly, mint green podium that always stands out like a sore thumb. We decided to cover it up this year. I told Bryony we should get wood panels and drill little holes in them to mimic the pixel grid. She said, &#8220;let&#8217;s just get pegboard&#8221;. I said &#8220;but the holes will be bigger than pixels and&#8230;&#8221;. She stopped me and said, &#8220;We ARE doing a pegboard.&#8221; And it looked great. We painted it yellow and, just like the cover, we &#8220;threaded&#8221; the logo on it. Bob Gill almost broke the podium but it held together until the last speaker.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/BN_Conf_2013_Identity_Case_Study_making_of_podium.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2013 Brand New Conference by UnderConsideration\" \/>\n<figcaption>Making of the podium.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/BN_Conf_2013_Identity_Case_Study_Podium_Live_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2013 Brand New Conference by UnderConsideration\" \/><hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/BN_Conf_2013_Identity_Case_Study_Podium_Live_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2013 Brand New Conference by UnderConsideration\" \/><hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/BN_Conf_2013_Identity_Case_Study_Podium_Live_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2013 Brand New Conference by UnderConsideration\" \/>\n<figcaption>The podium in action.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Marquee<\/h1>\n<p>This was done close to the last minute and I wish I had both more time to think about it and the software knowledge to play with it.

We could probably skip the expense of doing these big posters but, hey, it&#8217;s big posters, how can you say no?<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/BN_Conf_2013_Identity_Case_Study_Posters_01.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2013 Brand New Conference by UnderConsideration\" \/>\n<figcaption>Posters.

While this seems like a straightforward piece of collateral we had to do a &#8220;reprint&#8221; of 20 pounds of M&amp;Ms. We had done a small test of 2 pounds and they looked great so we ordered the full 20 and all the type had gone off center and gotten smushed (which is actually the samples photographed below as we gave out all the good ones) so we called up M&amp;Ms and they were so confused as to what was wrong but they saw our point. We got a fresh and more centered 20-pound-batch from them, and we donated the misaligned 20 pounds to the local Ronald McDonald&#8217;s House.<\/p>\n<p>The M&amp;Ms were inscribed with &#8220;#bnconf&#8221;, &#8220;New York 2013&#8221;, and &#8220;Chicago 2014&#8221; to tease next year&#8217;s location.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/BN_Conf_2013_Photos_Materials_Treat_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2013 Brand New Conference by UnderConsideration\" \/>\n<figcaption>Custom M&amp;Ms.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">2014: Chicago, 2 Days<\/h1>\n<p class=\"end\">In closing, next year&#8217;s conference will be held in beautiful Chicago, IL at the Harris Theater at Millennium Park on September 25 and 26.
