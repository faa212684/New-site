Like the subject of our last post, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tyra_rocks_some_fierce_lettering.php\">typeF<\/a>, eHow is owned by Demand Media and has an interesting, if slightly scary business model (reported thoroughly <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wired.com\/magazine\/2009\/10\/ff_demandmedia\/all\/1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">in a 2009 article on <em>Wired<\/em> magazine<\/a>) where freelance writers and\/or videographers produce dozens of good-but-not-<em>too<\/em>-good articles and\/or videos under very low pay but as long as the articles do well over time, the freelancers get paid residuals. In January alone, eHow attracted over 80 million unique users worldwide and this month it introduced a new logo.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ehow_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"eHow\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ehow_headers.png\" alt=\"eHow\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Website headers for main sections.<\/p>\n<p>I had stumbled across eHow many times and although I found some of the information helpful I really questioned the reliability of it all based on its logo and the aesthetics of website design, which I can best describe as a combination of generic web design and Nigerian scam. The new logo and website is much more lifestyle-y and feels like a modern-day content provider that will appeal to that vast demographic of 80 million people. At first glance the logo is striking with its bright green color and bold letterforms. With the folded paper approach, the logo looks like &#8220;fun&#8221; and crafty and likely to answer any question that begins with &#8220;How do I&hellip;&#8221;. Upon closer inspection, some of the details are kind of weird, mainly the &#8220;o&#8221; where no one could figure out how a circle would fold and the &#8220;w&#8221; which only has one fold, and based, on the fold-happy &#8220;H&#8221;, there is no reason why the &#8220;w&#8221; couldn&#8217;t have a few more. But these are minor nitpicks that the revolving door audience of eHow will not care about. The logo is not perfect, but neither is the content or quality of eHow. It&#8217;s good enough and sometimes that&#8217;s all that&#8217;s needed.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to Kevin Hammond for the tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_110321_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_110321_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"574\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,75,26],"tags":[46,319,42],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1391"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1391"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1391\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1391"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1391"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1391"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
