Its own separate identity, designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/foreignpolicy.design\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Foreign Policy Design Group<\/a>, uses a design language that references &#8220;the primary elements used in art-making: lines and dots; circle, square and triangle; red, blue, yellow and green&#8221;. While the ingredients aren&#8217;t novel, their use feels fresh by exaggerating their scale. Instead of dainty polka dot patterns, the circles feel like giant stickers or windows or the square grid like tiles instead of a notebook grid. The combination and layering of shapes is energetic and surprising while the single use of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.grillitype.com\/typefaces\/gt-pressura\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GT Pressura<\/a> (particularly its Mono variation) lends a contemporary touch. The transparent plastic bags with white ink are my favorite application. <a href=\"http:\/\/foreignpolicy.design\/portfolio\/branding\/gallery-co-branding\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Allsorts Black and White by Bond<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_allsorts_blackwhite.jpg\" alt=\"Allsorts Black and White by Bond\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">Back in 2004, in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_74.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Friday Likes 74<\/a>, we liked <a href=\"https:\/\/bond-agency.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bond<\/a>&#8216;s work for Allsorts licorice, made by Finnish confectioner <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cloetta.fi\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cloetta<\/a>. The colorful treat now comes in a black and white edition with a box to match. Just like the licorice remained the same shapes, combinations, and textures but changed to black, white, and gray, the box followed suit with a change to black, white, and silver. As much as I liked the colorful version, this might top it. It&#8217;s elegant, luxurious, and sexy&#8230; words not usually associated with licorice (unless that&#8217;s your <em>thing<\/em>). Also, fantastic product photography! <a href=\"https:\/\/bond-agency.com\/project\/allsorts-black-white\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Common Lot by Perky Bros<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_commonlot.jpg\" alt=\"Common Lot by Perky Bros\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/commonlot.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Common Lot<\/a> is a contemporary cuisine restaurant in Millburn, NJ, with communal tables and rustic feel. Its identity by Nashville, TN-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.perkybros.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Perky Bros<\/a> builds on that with upscale but unpretentious and playful typography. The serif wordmark can be arranged horizontally, stacked vertically, or, thanks to its wandering &#8220;O&#8221;s, it can even be turned into a 3-by-3 arrangement. The applications are executed beautifully with great paper stock and clear and copper foil. The menu covers with the &#8220;O&#8221;s in different places are particularly clever. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.perkybros.com\/portfolio\/commonlot\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"From crazy patterns and bold geometric shapes to minimalist serif compositions, we traverse it all with work from Singapore, Helsinki, and Nashville&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[701,327,564,872],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5030"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=5030"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5030\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=5030"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=5030"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=5030"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
