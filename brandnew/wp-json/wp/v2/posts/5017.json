Drawn by Tokyo, Japan-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/okimi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kimiaki Yaegashi<\/a>, the adorable yet full of moxie panda is brought to identity-life by Singapore-based <a href=\"http:\/\/bravo.rocks\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bravo<\/a> in a series of step-and-repeat patterns and its red color complemented by a neon green. There is also a Red Tail logo for the bar where &#8220;Tail&#8221; can change to any typeface but the hero is little Xiao Hong and how well he adapts to everything from coasters to t-shirts to drink stirrers. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/44308213\/Red-Tail-Bar\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Prism by Matchstic<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_prism.jpg\" alt=\"Prism by Matchstic\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.prismtfl.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Prism<\/a> is a line of &#8220;thermally fused laminates&#8221; &#8212; aka flat sheets that look like wood (or granite or something else) &#8212; by Atlanta, GA-based ARAUCO determined to not look or be perceived as cheap faux option to real wood. Not everyone can afford salvage wood from an 1800s factory, you know? Local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/matchstic.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Matchstic<\/a> designed a lovely identity aimed to appeal to interior designers and it does a great job in coming across as a design approach not easily scoffed at. The tilted &#8220;I&#8221; in the logo is playful and makes you think of laminates as not just a thin surface but as a complement to a thicker plank, giving it weight and presence. The best part about the project though is the color palette of earthy tones that pairs beautifully with the different laminates that look very hot as presented in the top-left image above and I doubt there are many thermally fused laminates you could say that about. <a href=\"http:\/\/matchstic.com\/work\/prism\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Boulevard Brewing Company by Helms Workshop<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_boulevardbrewing.jpg\" alt=\"Boulevard Brewing Company by Helms Workshop\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/boulevard.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Boulevard Brewing Company<\/a> is brewery in Kansas City, MO, that has grown to be the largest specialty brewer in the Midwest. To help that growth they have adopted a new bold and fun identity from Austin, TX-based <a href=\"http:\/\/helmsworkshop.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Helms Workshop<\/a>. Previously, Boulevard had <a href=\"http:\/\/goodlifeguy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/blvd-Current-Portfolio.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a free-for-all approach<\/a> where all labels were different but the recurring diamond shape served as the basis for the new system dominated by some kick-ass illustrations of tractors, VW vans, and campers living inside the diamonds along with industrious typography. Bonus diamond dingbats and patterns complete the system for a mature yet still youthful, specialty-brewer aesthetic. <a href=\"http:\/\/helmsworkshop.com\/work\/boulevard-brewing-rebrand\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Plenty of vivid colors and illustrations this week, with work from Singapore, Atlanta, and Austin&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[1307,1122,240],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5017"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=5017"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5017\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=5017"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=5017"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=5017"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
