Capilano University is enabled by the University Act, enrolling its first students in 1968. The school was established by local school boards and residents of the North Shore and Howe Sound on the need for a public institution serving the local communities. Initial enrollment was 784 students in 1968, and as of 2016, has grown to enroll approximately 11,600 students per year. Under the direction of its then president, Greg Lee, Capilano University was re-designated from a community college to a university, in 2008. Capilano University&#8217;s academic offerings include liberal arts, professional and career programs, leading to certificates, diplomas and degrees at the primarily undergraduate level.&#8221; (<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Capilano_University\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wikipedia<\/a>)<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/capilano_university_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Capilano University by Ion\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/capilano_university_logo_black.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Capilano University by Ion\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo, single color.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/capilano_university_messages.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Capilano University by Ion\" \/>\n<figcaption>Key messages and brand essence.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/capilano_university_viewbook.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Capilano University by Ion\" \/>\n<figcaption>Viewbook.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/capilano_university_businesscard.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Capilano University by Ion\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business card.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/capilano_university_letterhead.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Capilano University by Ion\" \/>\n<figcaption>Letterhead.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/capilano_university_styleguide.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Capilano University by Ion\" \/>\n<figcaption>Style guide.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/192979798?title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>New logo introduction.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"(Est. 1968) &quot;Capilano University is a teaching-focused university based in North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, with programming serving the Sunshine Coast and the Sea-to-Sky corridor.
