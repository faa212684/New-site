Moscow-based <a href=\"http:\/\/tomatdesign.ru\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tomatdesign<\/a> solved it with a very graphic system that takes the percentage sign &mdash; a symbol for discount &mdash; and places the name of the market in the two circles. They explain that &#8220;Al&#8221; means &#8220;buy&#8221; so the system allows for the bottom right circle to accommodate other words to construct sentences like &#8220;Buy \/ More&#8221; or &#8220;Buy\/ 2 for 1&#8221; and it can also substitute the bottom right circle for product photography creating a rebus for &#8220;Buy \/ Apples&#8221;. The red and white color palette, plus the italic type give this identity a great energy and dominant presence. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/Al-Market\/8728327\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Sushi Shop by Alexander Laguta<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_sushishop.jpg\" alt=\"Sushi Shop by Alexander Laguta\"\/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px;\">For Friday Likes I tend to go with the more unusual and graphic-y projects but sometimes all we can ask for is a simple, well-constructed icon with decent typography, applied properly. Which has almost become a lost art. So seeing <a href=\"http:\/\/sushishop.ru\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sushi Shop<\/a>&#8216;s charming logo designed by St. Petersburg-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.behance.net\/fuge\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Alexander Laguta<\/a> applied simply on fields of orange and white brings me some Friday joy. The logo shows cut fish inside a roll. There. Sushi. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/Sushi-Shop\/10065847\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Hot Wheels by Dan Janssen<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_hotwheels.jpg\" alt=\"Hot Wheels by Dan Janssen\"\/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px;\">This is, by far, not my style or my cup of tea and it doesn&#8217;t have that highfalutin aesthetic of 99% of the work we show on Brand New but that would never stop me from appreciating the consistency and energy that would drive a testosterone-fueled 8-year-old boy mad with excitement to see any of these graphics on a brand new <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hotwheels.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hot Wheels<\/a> toy. Designed by San Diego, CA-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.behance.net\/danj\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dan Janssen<\/a> this project appears to be a very comprehensive range of logos, badges, and other graphics to serve as assets for all kinds of Hot Wheels products and promotions. On their own, most of them are a little annoying but as a set they are staggeringly awesome. (A little less so when they go into color, but still&hellip; hot). <a href=\"http:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/Hot-Wheels-Design-and-Branding\/6849835\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Some smart and clever simplicity from Azerbaijan and Russia along with some hot-rod action from the good ol&apos; U.S. of A&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[663,564,918],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2638"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2638"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2638\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2638"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2638"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2638"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
