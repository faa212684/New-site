Perhaps too much of a puzzle and not enough of a logo. But mostly, very fuzzy &mdash; a lot of little, separate pieces. The new logo makes a clear statement. It&#8217;s hard to <em>not<\/em> see it or pay attention to it. Typeset in a condensed style of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.myfonts.com\/fonts\/fontbureau\/titling-gothic-fb\/?refby=ucllc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Titling Gothic<\/a>, the logo mimics the upward and downward incline of the building&#8217;s ramp to create an energetic wordmark that can be rendered in four configurations for flexible application. It&#8217;s not necessarily a &#8220;pretty&#8221; logo, sometimes the hard angles conflict with the rhythm of the implied diagonal but it&#8217;s those visual hiccups that sort of point back to the jarring combination of the old convent and the contemporary addition.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/arts_santa_monica_scipt.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Arts Santa M&ograve;nica by Mario Eskenazi\" \/>\n<figcaption>Custom application to generate the typography.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/arts_santa_monica_banners_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Arts Santa M&ograve;nica by Mario Eskenazi\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/arts_santa_monica_banners_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Arts Santa M&ograve;nica by Mario Eskenazi\" \/>\n<figcaption>Banners.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/arts_santa_monica_poster.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Arts Santa M&ograve;nica by Mario Eskenazi\" \/>\n<figcaption>Poster.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/arts_santa_monica_exhibit.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Arts Santa M&ograve;nica by Mario Eskenazi\" \/>\n<figcaption>Exhibit.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/arts_santa_monica_brochure.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Arts Santa M&ograve;nica by Mario Eskenazi\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brochures.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">To keep things easy for applications, a custom script application was created to generate the step&#8217;d typography. Entering a word renders it in four configurations, each growing and shrinking from left and right. The resulting typography works great to make tight-fitting compositions that establish a consistent identity no matter what. Perhaps in a year or two the system will become a little repetitive and exhausting but, for now, it works really great. The addition of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.myfonts.com\/fonts\/processtype\/maple\/?refby=ucllc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Maple<\/a>, a more extended and quirkier sans serif, creates a good contrast with the primary typography. Overall, this is a very smart interpretation of a building&#8217;s design that also signals a different kind of arts organization with its own particular voice.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Opened in 1988 in Barcelona, Arts Santa M&ograve;nica is a contemporary art museum without a permanent collection, hosting exhibits that showcase Catalan art, innovation, and thinking.
