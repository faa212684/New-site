This past December 1st, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.alcatel-lucent.com\/wps\/portal\/!ut\/p\/kcxml\/04_Sj9SPykssy0xPLMnMz0vM0Y_QjzKLd4w3cQ7SL8h2VAQAu32oaA!!?LMSG_CABINET=Docs_and_Resource_Ctr&#038;LMSG_CONTENT_FILE=News_Releases_2006\/News_Article_000013.xml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the merger was official<\/a> and a new identity for the siamesed company was unveiled.<\/p><!--more--><p>The identity was designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.eurorscg.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">EURO RSCG Worldwide<\/a> &mdash; yes, I know: &#8220;Huh?&#8221; &mdash; and the resulting icon for the identity is dubbed &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.theworldisalwayson.com\/story_of_the_logo.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Infinity Symbol<\/a>&#8221; formed by the literal unity between Alcatel&#8217;s &#8220;A&#8221; and Lucent&#8217;s &#8220;L&#8221; in what the press release describes as an icon that &#8220;looks as if it were drawn by hand&#8221; and, more importantly, &#8220;portraying the combination of two great companies creating a better future for its employees, its customers and its customers&#8217; customers.&#8221; If that is not enough meaning for you, the new identity also symbolizes &#8220;endless possibilities for the future of the combined company, and its commitment to being a strong, stable and enduring ally for our customers around the world.&#8221; As glaring as the new identity is, it is the selected color that surprised me the most, as purple &mdash; a rare choice in corporate and brand identity, and perhaps Alcatel-Lucent&#8217;s boldest move in establishing a recognizable brand &mdash; is a very hard color to pull off unless you are Barney. And so as not to disappoint, there is plenty of rhetoric around the hue: <em>a)<\/em> &#8220;[Purple] combines the stability of blue with the energy of red&#8221; and <em>b)<\/em> &#8220;[purple] has traditionally symbolized power and ambition and is associated with wisdom, dignity, independence and creativity.&#8221; On the trying-to-not-be-generic typography they offer that it &#8220;is designed to aid readability and comprehension with upper and lowercase letters.&#8221; No word, however, on what the generous shading means.<\/p>\n<center><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"alcatel_lucent_icon.gif\" src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/alcatel_lucent_icon.gif\" width=\"344\" height=\"341\" \/><\/center>\n<p>There isn&#8217;t enough positive reinforcement I can offer to this criteria and the resulting icon: A too-soon throwback to the generally curvaceous persona of numerous start-ups during the dot com era. Instead of a company that could literally be poised for world domination through telecommunication and 88,000 employees. The only admirable trait in this new identity is the color, even if a slightly more colorful purple could have pumped up the volume to the next level: A 4 out of 10 in my imaginary rating scale. And, of course, this new &#8220;Infinity Symbol&#8221; does not even have the fifteenth of impact, innovation or daringness of the one and only, Lucent&#8217;s late 90s-defining &#8220;Ring of Innovation&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Also known as &#8220;The Big Red Zero,&#8221; &#8220;The Flaming Goose Egg,&#8221; &#8220;The Coffee Stain,&#8221; and, my favorite, &#8220;The Devil&#8217;s Asshole,&#8221; Lucent&#8217;s swooping, red brush stroke was (in)famously <a href=\"http:\/\/www.landor.com\/?do=cPortfolio.getCase&#038;caseid=569\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">designed by Landor in 1996<\/a> to much of the industry&#8217;s (the telecommunications&#8217;, not the design&#8217;s) <a href=\"http:\/\/voice.aiga.org\/content.cfm?ContentAlias=%5Fgetfullarticle&#038;aid=2076918\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mocking chagrin<\/a>. While not as long-standing as the UPS or AT&amp;T logos, Lucent&#8217;s ring has become one of the most identifiable symbols and is regularly lumped along with Nike&#8217;s swoosh, Target&#8217;s target and Apple&#8217;s apple by businesses and organizations when alluding to the type of identity and recognizability they would like to achieve with their own. The ring also defied (and defined) a design era plagued by the ancestors of this new Alcatel-Lucent type of logos: heavy on curves and shading, lacking execution or longevity, mired in their own spin of meaning. It&#8217;s time has come too soon and put to rest by an inferior mark&hellip; a sad trend in brand and corporate identity these past five years that, like this new icon indicates, may last to infinity. And beyond.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,26,89],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/462"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=462"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/462\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=462"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=462"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=462"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
