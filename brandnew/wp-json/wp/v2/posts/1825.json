With 50 chapters across the U.S., NTMA counts with nearly 2,000 members &mdash; &#8220;members&#8221; are counted as businesses not individuals &mdash; covering industries &#8220;from aerospace to electronics to nuclear power.&#8221; The new identity was designed by Atlanta, GA-based <a href=\"http:\/\/matchstic.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Matchstic<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ntma_old_look.jpg\" alt=\"NTMA\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Old materials.<\/p>\n<blockquote>The new brand mark is an evolution of the previous logo, refined and updated. We retained some defining characteristics &mdash; the color and shape &mdash; but recast it in a richer shade of blue with custom lettering. The new identity reflects experience and precision.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/matchstic.com\/work\/case-studies\/ntma-case-study\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Matchstic Case Study<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ntma_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"NTMA\" \/><\/p>\n<p>I was almost going to say that the old logo wasn&#8217;t that bad &mdash; in that un-logo-less, inoffensive way &mdash; but then I saw that the &#8220;T&#8221; ate the serifs of the &#8220;N&#8221; and &#8220;M&#8221; next to it. I got offended. The old logo could have been for any non-profit whatsoever and didn&#8217;t reflect any kind of allusion to manufacturing. The new logo looks like it has been manufactured and chiseled with a precision machine and in the full-color application with the shine and shadows it looks like a badge that could go on the grill of a car or the door of a refrigerator. The logo is now much more appropriate and relevant, although it&#8217;s certainly not the best thing since the Industrial Revolution. On first instinct I want to like it, there is something blunt and industrial about it that catches my attention, but on the details and execution it doesn&#8217;t quite hold up: What does the diagonal line mean? If the angle of the &#8220;N&#8221; matches that line, why wouldn&#8217;t the notches in the &#8220;T&#8221; and &#8220;M&#8221; match too? Why is the crossbar in the &#8220;A&#8221; so short? Why is there so little space after the &#8220;A&#8221;? One more round of refinement and customization would have yielded a stronger logo.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ntma_brand_arch.gif\" alt=\"NTMA\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The logo placement feels unresolved throughout in the rest of the identity but somehow it strikes a good balance of being contemporary and having a blue collar look and feel. The use of OCR-A, always a hard trick to pull off, works well used sparingly. Overall, an improvement for sure, but it just needed a little extra kick to take it to the next level.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ntma_stationery.jpg\" alt=\"NTMA\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ntma_therecord.jpg\" alt=\"NTMA\" \/><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_120203_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_120203_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_120203_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_120203_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,79,26],"tags":[292,46,684,42],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1825"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1825"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1825\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1825"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1825"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1825"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
