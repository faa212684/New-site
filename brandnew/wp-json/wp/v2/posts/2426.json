This thought became the foundation of a bold, versatile visual system that could work effortlessly across offline and online applications, and resonate with an international audience. <br \/><br \/>The identity acts as frame for the Museum to open conversations on its varied initiatives that include exhibitions, research and education.

It&#8217;s not its fault. Damn thing is a great metaphor for a bunch of stuff. Plus, it&#8217;s simple and you can put all kinds of other stuff in it, around it, below it, etc. it. You could dismiss this identity as just <em>one more<\/em> in the long canon of speech bubble logos but there are a few moves that make it stand out. First, the hard-angled structure and rectangle shape are evocative of a flag, giving it more seriousness and a certain nationalistic edge. The dual logo in Latin and Arabic, each with the speech bubble in a different direction, establish the idea of dialogue not just in general but between two cultures. And the typography is an interesting choice, something unusual and almost kind of jarring in a good way. In application, the speech bubble does exactly what you would expect: it frames messages and images. Nothing too revolutionary, just simple and to the point. I wish the identity felt less British\/American and more Palestinian, whatever that may be &mdash; it feels to be missing something, other than an arabic logo, that makes it different from other museums around the world. Nonetheless, an elegant and contemporary identity.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_130417_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_130417_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_130417_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_130417_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[63,12,26],"tags":[45,327,861,282,537,654],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2426"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2426"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2426\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2426"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2426"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2426"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
