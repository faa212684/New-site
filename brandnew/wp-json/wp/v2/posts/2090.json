Boasting 13, the most in the U.S., American Viticultural Areas &mdash; official regions with boundaries defined by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau and the United States Department of the Treasury &mdash; Sonoma County is home to 1,800 grape growers and 350 wineries across 60,000-plus acres of awesome land. But nowadays pretty much every city and country has its very own &#8220;Wine Country&#8221; and Sonoma County was feeling the competition or, <a href=\"http:\/\/wearesonomacounty.com\/files\/wasc-factsheet.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">put more officially<\/a>, &#8220;there is more pressure than ever before to strengthen the presence of Sonoma County and its AVAs among world-class wine regions&#8221; so three of the county&#8217;s leading organizations &mdash; Sonoma County Vintners, Sonoma County Winegrape Commission, and Sonoma County Tourism Bureau &mdash; banded together to create <a href=\"http:\/\/wearesonomacounty.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">an official destination brand<\/a> as well as a national campaign to &#8220;build awareness through communications and promotion that will keep the Sonoma County brand visible and relevant, ensuring that every winery, grower, and our region as a whole benefits from the power of our brand.&#8221; The identity has been designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/landor.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Landor<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sonoma_county_logos_all.gif\" alt=\"Sonoma County Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<blockquote>The brand mark, which is in the style of a stencil or stamp designed to convey the unique craftsmanship at the heart of grape growing and winemaking in Sonoma County, has been approved by the Boards of all three organizations to adopt as their organization logos.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/wearesonomacounty.com\/files\/wasc-pressrelease.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press Release [PDF]<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sonoma_county_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"Sonoma County Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<blockquote>The Sonoma County logo&#8217;s rustic brown color and stencil style recall the unique craftsmanship at the heart of winemaking.

This is the sarcastic in me, but it&#8217;s all relative, and when you have competition from places like Niagara-on-the-Lake Wine Country or Texas Wine Country that are either destinations of their own or simply keep people where they are rather than travel to the edge of the U.S. then, yeah, I guess a brand would be nice. And this new Sonoma County identity is nice. But nothing more. The concept &mdash; a stencil you would find on a grape crate or a wine barrel &mdash; isn&#8217;t groundbreaking but the execution is somewhat interesting, mostly because of the good typeface selection. The distressed look works at a basic level, although I don&#8217;t see why the distress wouldn&#8217;t also affect the type and not just the border. In application the logo is meant to be like a stamp or seal of approval, so the stencil approach plays well. The real challenge is getting all those thousands of grape growers and hundreds of wineries to adopt the logo, otherwise you might just want to wrap your sweater around your neck and take your swirling elsewhere.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_120820_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_120820_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_120820_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_120820_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[64,12,26],"tags":[423,202,437,736],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2090"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2090"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2090\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2090"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2090"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2090"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
