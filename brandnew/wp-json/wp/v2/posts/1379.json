Its broadcast division owns over 20 local television stations and its digital division owns websites like CareerBuilder.com, MetroMix.com, and MomsLikeMe.com. Earlier this week, Gannett announced a new identity designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thefarm.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Farm<\/a> to replace the 30-year-old logo they had been using. The redesign has attracted some media attention because, besides being a media company itself, people are dumbfounded that the new identity comes with a 100-page guideline document. The horror! Oddly enough the whole document is <a href=\"http:\/\/docs.google.com\/viewer?a=v&#038;pid=explorer&#038;chrome=true&#038;srcid=0Byp0Rq2dGk1BMGM1NTk5OWMtYWE4Mi00MTgyLThkMTktNGI0ZGRmYzg3YTI4&#038;hl=en&#038;authkey=CJiThPIO\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">available publicly on Google Docs<\/a>. And for some reason, someone started a Gannett logo Twitter account <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/gannettlogo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@gannettlogo<\/a>. Yawn. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gannett.com\/section\/Brands01\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">This page<\/a> has a couple of brand videos and additional information.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/gannett_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"Gannett\" \/><\/p>\n<blockquote>Today, Gannett introduces the first new Gannett logo in more than 30 years. The blue logo is simple and straight-forward yet fresh and modern, elevating the Gannett corporate brand and representing who Gannett is today. It has roots in mid-century newspaper typefaces, and expresses a contemporary eloquence. By choosing an all-type logo, our properties can continue to make their own mark with each of their distinct logos, while at the same time allowing for a more seamless pairing with the parent company. <br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gannett.com\/apps\/pbcs.dll\/article?AID=\/99999999\/BRANDS01\/110302001\/-1\/brands01\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The History of the Gannett Logo<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/gannett_lock-ups.png\" alt=\"Gannett\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">The logo as endorsing mark.<\/p>\n<p>As some of you know, 100 pages worth of guidelines for a company this size is barely an appetizer but I can see how others might react to it, especially when the logo is just a wordmark. Set in Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones&#8217; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.typography.com\/fonts\/font_overview.php?productLineID=100009\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Verlag<\/a>, the new logo is bland. Very bland. But it doesn&#8217;t need to be anything more, really. Besides being a business-to-business logo it has to act as a basic endorser of all of its publications, so it can&#8217;t be too much of a visual powerhouse to avoid competing against each publication&#8217;s logo. However, that doesn&#8217;t excuse the overall sloppiness and boringness of its application, at least as seen in some of the examples above. Many people hated the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_nbc_peacock_is_gone_and_rightfully_so.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NBC &#8220;It&#8217;s just a Font&#8221; Universal<\/a> identity, but compare it to Gannett, which is arguably apples-to-apples, and you see how much more successful that one is based on the same premise of a wordmark whose main job is to endorse and establish a continuous strain of visual DNA. There is nothing truly wrong with the Gannett identity, but there isn&#8217;t anything memorable about it either.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/gannett_print_ads.png\" alt=\"Gannett\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/A_L\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Al Shaw<\/a> for first tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_110311_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_110311_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_110311_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_110311_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,82,26],"tags":[485,42,486,112],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1379"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1379"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1379\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1379"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1379"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1379"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
