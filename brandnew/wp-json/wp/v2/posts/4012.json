Looking to expand beyond their market in Spain and compete with the larger electronic companies, BQ recently introduced a new identity designed by Madrid-based <a href=\"http:\/\/saffron-consultants.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Saffron<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>Based on its already inherent DNA, we defined BQ&#8217;s brand purpose, which is &#8220;to help people understand technology, encourage them to use it and inspire them to develop it&#8221;. We also spelled out the key features of their personality as honest, challenging, dynamic, reliable and didactic.<br \/><br \/>All these aspects of BQ&#8217;s DNA led us to create a lively and unique visual identity that inspires people to make the most of their ideas through using and understanding technology. It all starts with a digital imprint &#8212; in both senses of the word &#8212; that ignites the creation process. This symbol, along with a white window that interacts with changing backgrounds, brings BQ&#8217;s brand purpose to life.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/saffron-consultants.com\/work\/bq\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Saffron project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bq_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for BQ by Saffron\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/127751458?color=f04923&#038;title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Introduction to BQ.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The previous logo was really bad with a terrible selection of rounded sans serif and an unflattering monogram of the &#8220;b&#8221; and &#8220;q&#8221; kissing. It looked like like a logo for cheap knock-offs. The new logo is far more conceptual and sophisticated. At first I just thought, &#8220;Oh, great, another tech logo with dots signifying connectivity&#8221; but the purple dot indicated something else. It wasn&#8217;t until I saw the movie above that I got it. Five dots, five thumbprints. It&#8217;s a lovely idea. I wonder how many people will get it without an explanation? Nonetheless, a smart idea with an understated execution. The &#8220;bq&#8221; typography&hellip; someone at Saffron really likes these tight, chopped up stems &mdash; see <a href=\"http:\/\/saffron-consultants.com\/work\/panda\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Panda<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/saffron-consultants.com\/work\/apollo\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Apollo<\/a>.

The latter is the only that seems extraneous, they could probably do without it. The X-ray box is a cool device and makes for some interesting layouts (best seen in the posters) and ideas (as in the brochure&#8217;s flap) with the five-dot icon placed on the lower corners. Akkurat (Regular and Mono) are always a crowd pleaser and both work well in this identity. The squiggles&hellip; I like visually but maybe they clash with the cleanliness of everything else; as shown in the prototype of the packaging, it would be cool if they swelled around on the lock screen of the phone. Overall, this is a groovy update that definitely raises BQ&#8217;s visual presence.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 2005 as MemoriasUSB (USBMemory) by six engineering students of Universidad Polit&eacute;cnica de Madrid, BQ (as it was renamed in 2010) started by importing and selling USB memory sticks, later an e-reader called booq, and now also offers smartphones,&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,51,26],"tags":[579,148,476,309,572],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4012"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4012"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4012\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4012"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4012"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4012"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
