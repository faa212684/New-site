If you&#8217;ve ever wanted to watch <em>Frasier<\/em> with Finnish subtitles, today at 6:00 pm and 1:50 am is your chance. This past December, Nelonen introduced a new logo and on-air package designed by London-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.proudcreative.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Proud Creative<\/a> after a 4-way creative pitch.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>The original logo form was conceived from early experimentation with folded strips of paper. This led to the fluid folding animation style and realistic movement, with light and shadow added to give a tactile feel. To avoid any &#8216;craft&#8217; clich\u00e9s and to heighten the sense of an &#8216;entertainment&#8217; brand, we added the slightest touch of polish to the renders.<br \/><br \/>The result is a logo that is constantly alive and in motion. The animation style and vibrant palette are strong enough that you don&#8217;t need to see the fully resolved logo to know you are in the world of Nelonen.<\/blockquote><h3>Proud Creative provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nelonen_logo_folded_paper.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and On-air Look for Nelonen by Proud Creative\" \/>\n<figcaption>Paper explorations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nelonen_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and On-air Look for Nelonen by Proud Creative\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo grid and detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nelonen_logo_colors.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and On-air Look for Nelonen by Proud Creative\" \/>\n<figcaption>Color variations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo was a&hellip; &#8220;4&#8221;. The new logo is still a &#8220;4&#8221; but at least there is some graphic intrigue to it other than the glyph sitting in a blue shape. In its static form, through color overlays, the logo hints at the folds that make up its structure and while the effect is best appreciated in motion, of course, the static version appears to have enough dynamism and depth to it without yet contorting. The chosen shape of the &#8220;4&#8221; is quite pleasant and the colors are bright and peppy, giving it a fresh presence while the choice of <a href=\"http:\/\/lineto.com\/The%20Fonts\/Font%20Categories\/Text%20Fonts\/Brown\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lineto&#8217;s Brown<\/a> keeps the identity in check with today&#8217;s typographic standards.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nelonen_type.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and On-air Look for Nelonen by Proud Creative\" \/>\n<figcaption>Typography.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nelonen_guidelines.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and On-air Look for Nelonen by Proud Creative\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sample guideline pages.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nelonen_advertising.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and On-air Look for Nelonen by Proud Creative\" \/>\n<figcaption>Out of home advertising.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The visual approach is supported by a soundscape created by the brilliant Simon Pyke at <a href=\"http:\/\/freefarm.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Freefarm<\/a>. Simon has a very rare ability to create audio that is utterly unique and compelling, whilst still having required warmth and approachability.<\/blockquote><h3>Proud Creative provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/114963781?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=ffffff\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>On-air package.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>In motion, the folded paper approach works great, allowing the logo to appear and disappear in cool ways as well as swipe and twist across the screen. I specially like when the logo sits tight from top to bottom and flush right on the screen (as well as in the print examples above). As popular as Brown (and Circular) are, here it feels a little gratuitous or, if not gratuitous, at least it doesn&#8217;t seem to add much or complement the logo in a special way. Nonetheless, a fun on-air package with entertaining behavior for the logo.<\/p>\n<blockquote>The idents are based on the concept &#8216;We are Nelonen&#8217;.<br \/><br \/>The five and ten second films are about all of Finland: Finland reflected in the people and showing the emotion of Finland. By association, they are also about what Nelonen the channel can be, at it&#8217;s best. A mirror reflecting back what it can mean to be Finnish.<br \/><br \/>We were clear that there should be no acting in these spots, and when choosing to work with brilliant Finnish director, <a href=\"http:\/\/variety.com\/2013\/film\/features\/10-directors-to-watch-heart-of-a-lion-director-dome-karukoski-tests-limits-1200970692\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dome Kurakoski<\/a>, we knew we had someone onboard who shared our vision.<br \/><br \/>He was meticulous in his research and then sensitive in how he dealt with this. Through the use of sound, pictures, moving image and conversation he drew the most amazing range of reaction and emotion from our chosen cast.<\/blockquote><h3>Proud Creative provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/114968781?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=ffffff\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Idents showreel.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">One more piece of the project are these idents, which are quite charming and prove impossible to not mimic the expressions yourself as you watch them.
