The design is based on the creative concept &#8221;The Magic of Big Entertainment&#8221; and shows colourful light, shed on big entertaining content. The colourscapes highlight the contrast between light and dark, synonymous to the rich contrasts within Finnish society.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.caperock.tv\/work\/nelonen\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CapeRock project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nelonen_2018_logo.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and On-air Graphics for Nelonen by CapeRock\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nelonen_2018_logo_colors.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and On-air Graphics for Nelonen by CapeRock\" \/>\n<figcaption>Color variations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nelonen_2018_logo_gradients.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and On-air Graphics for Nelonen by CapeRock\" \/>\n<figcaption>On gradient.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/294160414?title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0&#038;autoplay=1&#038;loop=1\" width=\"360\" height=\"203\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo animation. Dig the thin flashing sliver of color at the 45-degree angle.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo had only been around three years &#8212; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/new_logo_identity_and_on-air_look_for_nelonen_by_proud_creative.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Reviewed here in 2015<\/a> &#8212; which, even for TV channel standards, is a small amount of time to build any equity or lasting relationship with viewers. It was an okay logo with an intriguing construction of the number &#8220;4&#8221;. The new logo is a less intriguing and more straightforward construction of the number &#8220;4&#8221;, layering strokes of gradients one over the other in 0-, 45, and 90-degree angles. On its own, and on a white background, it&#8217;s really not that much to get excited about. When the logo doubles down on the gradients and illuminates the background with a graphic interpretation of the Northern Lights, it&#8217;s definitely more pleasant, enjoyable, and stimulating. Playing off of the logo&#8217;s 45-degree angle, the identity literally emanates from it, activating the logo throughout the motion and static applications.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nelonen_2018_ad_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and On-air Graphics for Nelonen by CapeRock\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nelonen_2018_ad_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and On-air Graphics for Nelonen by CapeRock\" \/>\n<figcaption>Ads.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nelonen_2018_instagram.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and On-air Graphics for Nelonen by CapeRock\" \/>\n<figcaption>Instagram account.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Not much to see in static applications but you can get the gist of it as the logo sits on the bottom-left corner with a subtle gradient separating it from the content underneath and leading the eye towards the show titles. It&#8217;s not super amazing but it works. The font used in applications feels sort of random in its choice &#8212; it&#8217;s a decent font but it&#8217;s not clear how it supports the identity or the concept or how it&#8217;s different from a font that would look equally at home on a telco brand. Nonetheless, it looks fine.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nelonen_2018_titles_grid.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and On-air Graphics for Nelonen by CapeRock\" \/>\n<figcaption>Titles grid.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nelonen_2018_titles_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and On-air Graphics for Nelonen by CapeRock\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nelonen_2018_titles_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and On-air Graphics for Nelonen by CapeRock\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sample titles.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/294338980?title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"360\" height=\"203\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>On-air application.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/293362464?title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"360\" height=\"203\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Idents.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">There is also only a brief look at the on-screen graphics with the sample of the titles in motion; they are nice to look at and I like how the system is able to unify the different show and movie photos through overlaying the gradient. The idents start out good with the shades of the gradients illuminating the young people in funky locations but the payoff of showing them around the logo floating around or above them at the end of each one feels kind of corny. They also clearly mark the age group of the channel, which makes me feel old. Overall, it&#8217;s a good-looking system but it may also have a quick expiration date as a long-term solution for the channel.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Launched in 1997 (originally named PTV then PTV4), Nelonen &#8212; Finnish for the number 4 &#8212; is an entertainment channel in Finland that combines import programming from Australia, the U.S., the UK, and Europe &#8212; think 90210, Grey&apos;s Anatomy, Mad&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,66,26],"tags":[1391,419,32,469,290,429],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6993"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=6993"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6993\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=6993"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=6993"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=6993"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
