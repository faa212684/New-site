With 70 employees, IIS is responsible for the registration of domain names, and the administration and technical maintenance of the national domain-name registry. This past June, IIS announced its new name and introduced a new logo. No design credit given.<\/p><!--more--><p>A press release about the name change is available <a href=\"https:\/\/www.iis.se\/english\/press\/pressreleases\/the-foundation-se-changes-name-to-iis\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a> and a, um, top-level brand guidelines set is available <a href=\"http:\/\/brandbook.iis.se\/iis\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/iis_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Name and Logo for IIS\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/130215882\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo animation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">The previous logo was fine and more troublesome was the fact that organization was called .SE &mdash; that&#8217;s not a very user friendly name. So not only is the name change good and more appropriate but the logo change is so so so so good. It should make you red with jealousy that you didn&#8217;t come up with it. Not that you were assigned to do it, but you know what I mean. It&#8217;s such a simple, smart, and appropriate solution. In case you don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m raving about, the &#8220;ii&#8221; is made from Sweden&#8217;s flag rotated. Sooooo good! It reminds me of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/new_logo_for_design_from_finland_by_werklig.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Design from Finland logo<\/a> but even better and simpler if that&#8217;s possible. The execution here is perfect too, with the top end of the &#8220;S&#8221; matching the bottom of the tittle in the &#8220;i&#8221;s. Have I said how so good this is? It&#8217;s so good.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1997 as II-Stiftelsen (short for Internetinfrastrukturv Stiftelsen; Swedish for Internet Infrastructure Foundation) and renamed as .SE in 2006, the newly re-renamed IIS (short for Internetstiftelsen i Sverige; Swedish for The Internet Foundation in Sweden) is the non-profit organization&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,79,26],"tags":[340,40,224],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4181"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4181"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4181\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4181"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4181"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4181"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
