Transactions are free as long as the money is coming from a linked bank account, with money being made by PayPal from credit card transactions and from select merchants who accept Venmo as payment. In 2018, when Venmo&#8217;s popularity began to rise, it processed $12 billion in volume in the first quarter alone. Apart from the ease of use, what makes Venmo interesting is that its home screen is a feed of other users transactions so you can see either complete strangers&#8217; or your friends&#8217; payment activity &#8212; no specific amounts just who they paid and for what &#8212; which, call me old fashioned, but the first time I realized that my transaction subjects were public it felt very invasive. You can opt out of making your transactions public, yet this is what makes Venmo, Venmo&#8230; officially a &#8220;social payments app&#8221;. Starting with their social media, Venmo is rolling out a new identity designed by <a href=\"https:\/\/koto.studio\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Koto<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>The new electric blue retains the heritage of the original Venmo blue. It&#8217;s been tweaked to work harder and more consistently across all applications, on screen and off. A broader palette of complementary colours now sits alongside it. With its flexibility to be either bold or controlled, <a href=\"https:\/\/omsetype.co\/athletics-2\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Athletics<\/a> is the perfect typeface for Venmo, more than matching the energy of the rest of the brand. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.schick-toikka.com\/scto-grotesk-a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Scto Grotesk<\/a> is a more functional secondary partner that still holds its own.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/koto.studio\/project\/venmo\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Koto project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/venmo_logo_before_after.png\" alt=\"New Identity for Venmo by Koto\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo, before and after.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>No, your eyes do not deceive you, there is nothing different about the logo, which remains exactly the same. The only difference is the tone of blue, which seems frivolous but, at least as a sample audience of one person, the first time I ever used Venmo, the shade of blue gave me pause in whether I would trust the service or not &#8212; it felt like a cheap color for an app from the mid 2000s. It didn&#8217;t seem right. The new blue is obviously on trend but it now fits within the vibrant Instagram\/Facebook\/WhatsApp shades. In terms of the logo, it&#8217;s a nice wordmark with a distinctive curly-esque &#8220;v&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>[Image of old identity deleted by agency request]<\/p>\n<blockquote>Created in collaboration with <a href=\"https:\/\/sebastiancuri.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sebastian Curi<\/a>, the new set of illustrations bring to life all the many experiences behind Venmo payments, from road trips to ramen.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/koto.studio\/project\/venmo\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Koto project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/venmo_illustration_process.jpg\" alt=\"New Identity for Venmo by Koto\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/venmo_Character_Animation.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Illustrations, from sketches to finished drawings.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>Since day one, Venmo&#8217;s users have made it what it is.

You can see many more samples on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/82856285\/Venmo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">his Behance project page<\/a>. I do wonder, however, how sustainable this is beyond a couple of years? It looks like there is a wide library of illustrations but for how long and for how many messages can they be used? Maybe the answer is that it doesn&#8217;t matter and this is indeed part of a 2- or 3-year plan as Venmo escalates into its next stage and will then be able to shed this for whatever makes sense in the future. Right now, though, the message is: This is fun, jump in, ask questions later.<\/p>\n<blockquote>Already a key part of the product experience, we&#8217;ve rendered the Venmo payment feed as a graphic framework.

Even though I already understand what Venmo does, the three examples above confuse me. It&#8217;s hard to tell if they are sample UI screens, actual ads, or just random stuff put inside a 1920 &times; 1080 canvas.

I dunno, maybe I&#8217;m getting old &#8212; today&#8217;s my 42nd birthday actually, so that&#8217;s probably not it, LOL &#8212; or maybe I am expecting more straightforward messaging to appease the relative awkwardness of the app and its social component. In any case, this all makes Venmo look fun, accessible, and relevant for a younger generation with less hang-ups than me.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 2009, Venmo is a mobile payment service that allows people to quickly send each other money through their app. Unlike PayPal (although owned by PayPal since 2013) where there are multiple clicks and screens required to send money&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[12,26,92],"tags":[292,617,39,1229,42],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7868"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=7868"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7868\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=7868"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=7868"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=7868"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
