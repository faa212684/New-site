Designed by New York, NY-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.boyburnsbarn.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> BoyBurnsBarn<\/a>, the identity is a mix of &#8220;British secret societies, Ivy League Prep with a dash of back alley speakeasy&#8221;. From the stylized lion to the lane numbers to the menu, everything has a fun, sophisticated sharpness (both literal and metaphorical) that gives this place a fantastic feel. Overall, just a great use of typography, graphics, and space implementation. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.boyburnsbarn.com\/work\/the-painted-pin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Fruits Shop by Mintbrand<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_fruitsshop.jpg\" alt=\"Fruits Shop by Mintbrand\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">I don&#8217;t expect this design, by Beijing-based <a href=\"http:\/\/mintbrand.cn\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mintbrand<\/a>, to be wholly liked. More than half of it I don&#8217;t even know what&#8217;s going on because of the language but there it has a kind of graphic feng shui that makes the spare, almost unsophisticated elements work beautifully together. I mean, who uses <a href=\"http:\/\/www.myfonts.com\/fonts\/itc\/benguiat\/?refby=ucllc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ITC Benguiat<\/a> unironically? Not only that, it looks great. The name of the place is so good too. Fruits Shop. Any questions? Of course not. <a href=\"http:\/\/mintbrand.cn\/?project=319\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">CUB by Nora Demeczky and Agnes Herr<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_cubanimation.gif\" alt=\"CUB by Nora Demeczky and Agnes Herr\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">Designed by Budapest-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/norademeczky\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nora Demeczky<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/herragi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Agnes Herr<\/a> for local animation studio <a href=\"http:\/\/cubanimation.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CUB<\/a>, the identity features a pretty simple and not entirely surprising wordmark but the real hat trick comes in the implementation of the logo. Using an acrylic stencil, the designers have filled in the logo in various styles and then made lumpy frame animations that bring the textures to life. Additionally, the business cards are, literally, a blast of fun with the splatter-painted stencil logo and matching edges. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/19590031\/CUB-animation-studio\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project here<\/strong><\/a><\/strong>.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"From funky to traditional to scrappy, this week has a little bit of everything with work from New York, Beijing, and Budapest&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[1048,33,437],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3660"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3660"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3660\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3660"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3660"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3660"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
