This comes at an opportune time for UCF as they are starting to become a major player in Conference USA. Designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/home.columbus.rr.com\/rickabaughs\/TOC.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rickabaugh Graphics, Inc.<\/a> (consistent purveyors of sports logos), the new identity system is highly functional for all sports.<\/p><!--more--><p>The old logo was a little ambiguous  &mdash; a knight holding a jousting stick with amateur typography and a splash behind the knight  &mdash; it all added up to a weak identity. Now the more aggressive looking knight and bolder typography make the identity come to life. The website, merchandise, playing fields, uniforms,&hellip; everything (including the <a href=\"http:\/\/ucfathletics.cstv.com\/ucf.ico\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cute favicon kinght<\/a>!) now has an integrated feel and function. The new logo will be seen on merchandise and apparel which is available June 15&hellip; just before football season.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ucf_variations.gif\" alt=\"UCF Identity Variations\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In the world of sports, logos tend to have some common attributes. First, they are usually two or three colors; second, they are either initials or a figure; and third, they are usually pointy. I know there are some logos that break these three attributes, but for what it&#8217;s worth these attributes are universal. UCF fits all three of these. Ultimately the logo works for UCF as it is a smaller school competing against the other big three Florida schools. There is now a direction and sense of empowerment for the athletics department.<\/p>\n<p>For more information please read the <a href=\"http:\/\/ucfathletics.cstv.com\/genrel\/050407abn.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">press release<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Thanks to Gavin Hall for the tip.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":15,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,26,87],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/500"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/15"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=500"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/500\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=500"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=500"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=500"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
