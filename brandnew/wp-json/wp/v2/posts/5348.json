(Puffed wheat is what <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Honey_Smacks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Honey Smacks<\/a> is, in case you&#8217;ve heard of it, except that one comes loaded with sugar &#8212; it was one my childhood favorites.) The Good Grain brand was recently acquired by specialist cereal manufacturer Brecks and relaunched with a new design by Leeds, UK-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.robot-food.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Robot Food<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>Drawing from the new brand blueprint, Robot Food developed the strapline &#8216;Good Grain, Good You&#8217;, and created an identity with a challenger brand feel that radiates on front of pack against a vibrant colour palette. Being 100% natural wheat and nothing else, Good Grain makes an ideal basis for a personalised breakfast, so the creative team positioned the cereal as &#8216;just the start and the rest is up to you&#8217;. [&hellip;] Smashing category norms and swerving all the usual category clich\u00e9s, the new-look Good Grain transforms the brand&#8217;s unpretentious simplicity into its biggest advantage: versatility and creativity.<\/blockquote><h3>Robot Food provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/good_grain_logo.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Good Grain by Robot Food\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo was mostly okay; it had the right idea of going all rugged and it did a proper job in making each letter uniquely rugged. The &#8220;THE&#8221; and &#8220;CO&#8221; should have been made to be the same weight as each other and possibly the same as &#8220;GOOD GRAIN&#8221;. If it had any shortcomings it would be that it wasn&#8217;t exciting, which is something the new logo fixes by literally making it exciting through a circumference of emanating excited lines around the typography. The new logo maintains the ruggedness of the previous version but in a more subtle way &#8212; props for doing a different texture for the repeating &#8220;G&#8221;s and &#8220;O&#8221;s. I also, surprisingly to me, like the lowercase &#8220;i&#8221; amidst all the uppercase and how that shape repeats in the excited lines. The overall logo aesthetic is healthy-hipster-chic but it looks really good and convincing.<\/p>\n<p>The website uses <a href=\"https:\/\/www.myfonts.com\/fonts\/font-fabric\/intro-rust\/head-base\/?refby=ucllc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Intro Head R Base<\/a>, which is probably the basis for the logo, which looks to be customized. It&#8217;s complemented on the packaging (and website) with <a href=\"https:\/\/lineto.com\/The+Fonts\/Font+Categories\/Text+Fonts\/Brown\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lineto&#8217;s Brown<\/a>.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/good_grain_packaging_before_after.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Good Grain by Robot Food\" \/>\n<figcaption>Packaging, before and after.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/good_grain_packaging_all.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Good Grain by Robot Food\" \/>\n<figcaption>New packaging line-up.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old packaging was standard grocery store fare, with questionable typography and over-saturation of elements designed to demand attention in any way possible. The new packaging achieves that through simplicity and by using the logo extra large, taking up more than half of the front of the box. The exclamation lines literally scream &#8220;Look here!&#8221;. The full-color backgrounds feel rich and they offset the bowl shots quite nicely, which serve as holding devices for product information.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/good_grain_packaging_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Good Grain by Robot Food\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/good_grain_packaging_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Good Grain by Robot Food\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/good_grain_packaging_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Good Grain by Robot Food\" \/>\n<figcaption>The three flavors.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/good_grain_packaging_detail.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Good Grain by Robot Food\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/good_grain_packaging_detail_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Good Grain by Robot Food\" \/>\n<figcaption>Details.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/good_grain_packaging_back.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Good Grain by Robot Food\" \/>\n<figcaption>Back of the box.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/good_grain_bowl_photos.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Good Grain by Robot Food\" \/>\n<figcaption>Product photography.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">The combination of the condensed rugged font and Brown works well on the boxes and a big part of that appeal is the no-frills product photography that looks natural and tasty. Overall, the new packaging feels fresh, healthy, and fun and it does so without it looking like it&#8217;s trying too hard.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Introduced more than 75 years ago &#8212; couldn&apos;t find an exact year &#8212; Good Grain is a brand of puffed wheat cereal available in the UK.
