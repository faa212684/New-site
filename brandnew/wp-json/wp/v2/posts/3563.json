Owned by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.destileriaserralles.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Destiler&iacute;a Serrall&eacute;s<\/a>, Don Q has been available in the U.S. since 2009 when the distillery opened an outpost in Dallas, TX, importing the different rums available: Cristal, Gold, A&ntilde;ejo, Gran A&ntilde;ejo, and four flavored rums. This month, Don Q introduced a new logo and packaging designed by Dallas-based <a href=\"http:\/\/tracylocke.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TracyLocke<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>With its 150th Anniversary approaching, Destiler&iacute;a Serrall&eacute;s, has refreshed its flagship brand, Don Q with a brand new look to its packaging, paying homage to its heritage with a retro look filled with character and inspiration. Drawing on its 149 years of history, the look and feel of the new package features clean classic lines and elegant graphics that go in line with the values that have guided the Serrall&eacute;s family rum-making tradition for six generations.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/thefloatingrumshack.com\/content\/index.php\/205-a-new-look-for-don-q-rum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press release<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/don_q_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Don Q by TracyLocke\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The previous logo had a literal depiction of Don Quixote, looking a little sad, sitting on top of a relatively decent wordmark that felt more like a corporate wordmark than a party-starting alcoholic drink. Giving the boot to Mr. Quixote, the new logo focuses on the &#8220;Q&#8221; and grows a leafy, floral crest around it. It&#8217;s a little bit random but it&#8217;s kind of pretty and well done, with the thickness of &#8220;DON&#8221; matching that of the crest and bigger flowers while the &#8220;Q&#8221; sits comfortably in the wider bottom. More importantly, the logo fits on the bottle much better. (And look! Sad Quixote is on the new neck foil.)<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/don_q_bottles_before-after.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Don Q by TracyLocke\" \/>\n<figcaption>Before and after comparison of two of the main rums.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The new bottles are a vast improvement over the old ones. The logo takes up a nice chunk of real estate, giving it excellent shelf presence and its leaves and flowers integrate very well with the product. The rest of the typography moving down from the logo starts out okay with the stroked sans but then gets less exciting with the cheesy script and condensed serif at the very bottom.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/don_q_bottles_all.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Don Q by TracyLocke\" \/>\n<figcaption>Full line-up.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/don_q_bottles_sexy_background.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Don Q by TracyLocke\" \/>\n<figcaption>Bottles with sexy backgrounds.
