For comparison, <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Quad_Cinema#\/media\/File:Quad_Cinema_W_13_St_2014-03-08_11-37.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this<\/a> is what it used to look like! The new logo plays off of the name &#8212; quad \/ four &#8212; with a tight set of custom square letters that go edge to edge to edge to edge. In 3D application, the logo is extruded in aluminum for a glorious marquee that extends from the facade to the lobby with the logo, literally, lit at both ends. The minimal interiors are, again and literally, lit by the logo, highlighting the material and color choices throughout, especially in the four auditoriums that have each been assigned one of the letters in the name and feature a custom light fixture in the shape of the letter. It&#8217;s like the baby of <em>Dr. Strangelove<\/em>&#8216;s war room and Edna Mode&#8217;s house. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.pentagram.com\/#\/blog\/137983\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Tavola by Peck &amp; Company<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_tavola.jpg\" alt=\"Tavola by Peck &amp; Company\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.tavolawine.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tavola<\/a> (&#8220;table&#8221; in Italian) is the Nashville, TN-based wine consulting business of Robin Riddell Jones, who knows a thing or forty about wine, helping restaurants develop their wine offerings, offering a monthly wine club, and classes open to the public. Designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/peckandco.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Peck &amp; Company<\/a>, the identity celebrates the metaphorical messiness of life through stark splatters of paint across the materials that are offset by an elegant, custom wordmark. There is also a playful wine glass icon, drawn in a funky perspective, that adds a fun, youthful touch to the business. I really like how gold foil has been used to make the stock boxes more special with the bonus black tag. Overall, this has a great, upscale but inclusive aesthetic.  <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/peckandco.com\/tavola\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Arquitectura ERRE by Bienal Comunicaci\u00f3n<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_arquitecturaerre.jpg\" alt=\"Arquitectura ERRE by Bienal Comunicaci\u00f3n\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/arquitecturaerre.mx\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Arquitectura ERRE<\/a> is an architecture firm in Mexico City with a groovy modernist aesthetic in their residential, commercial, and office designs. The name, ERRE, is the phonetic sound of the letter &#8220;R&#8221; in Spanish, which explains the emphasis of those letters in the logo, designed by M\u00e9rida, Mexico-based <a href=\"http:\/\/bienal.mx\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bienal Comunicaci\u00f3n<\/a>. It&#8217;s such a simple graphic maneuver, and as typeset in a minimal, structural sans serif, I found it quite smart and attractive. It&#8217;s lovely how nicely the two &#8220;R&#8221;s yin-yang with each other. The applications are a little on the dry side and there is a secondary device that are, perhaps, a set of abstract &#8220;R&#8221;s that then add up to make a pattern (best to see this in the videos at the link) that at times feels a little gratuitous but also lends itself to great details like the string around the folder.
