The latest, and possibly one of their best yet, is for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hyatt.com\/corporate\/restaurants\/rulfo\/en\/home\/Amado.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amado by Hyatt<\/a>, an artisan bakery and candy boutique located in the lobby of the Hyatt Regency hotel in the groovy Polanco neighborhood. Named after Mexican poet Amado Nervo, the identity channels the modernist style of Mexican architect Luis Barrag&aacute;n in a beautiful system of diagonal blocks of colors in vibrant colors accentuated by a flower-like pattern in silver foil stamp. A couple other patterns are in play too, but it&#8217;s this flower one that really makes it and how the patterns wrap around the corners what sells it. The logo is nicely typeset in some cut of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.myfonts.com\/search\/cheltenham\/fonts\/?refby=ucllc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cheltenham<\/a> that looks great in black against all the visual festivity around it. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.anagrama.com\/portafolio\/195-amado-by-hyatt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Zador by Eszter Laki<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_zador.jpg\" alt=\"Zador by Eszter Laki\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.zador.com\/aboutus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Zador<\/a> is a high-end line of soaps created with tender loving care in Hungary. Each bar is packaged by hand at their factory, wrapped in the beautiful design of Budapest-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/lakieszti\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Eszter Laki<\/a>, who drew by hand all the different floral patterns and set up a simple system for each soap variety. The logo on its own is alright but when it&#8217;s foil stamped on the black band and its &#8220;Z&#8221; monogram set as a wraparound pattern it&#8217;s just lovely. The earthy color palette makes you want to lie in a bed of Zador soap bars and smell them all night long. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/17352933\/ZADOR-\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project here<\/strong><\/a><\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">30 Park Place by Mother New York<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_30parkplace.jpg\" alt=\"30 Park Place by Mother New York\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">Designed by New Yorchitect &mdash; just made that up! &mdash; Robert A.M. Stern and towering over Tribeca in downtown New York, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thirtyparkplace.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">30 Park Place<\/a> is a luxury residential condominium managed by Four Seasons. Once you get past the opulence, the highlight of this posh place is the clever and sexy &#8220;30&#8221; monogram designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.motherdesign.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mother New York<\/a>. It&#8217;s just perfectly done and a great discovery of entangled letterforms (or numberforms, I guess). The monogram is accompanied by tasteful typography and the identity is deployed in fancy printing, with gentle touches of gold foil stamp to accentuate the icon on the off-white stock. Imagining how garish this identity could have been, makes this project even better. (The full project link is a little wonky as apparently Mother New York is too cool to have regular URLs going to specific projects, so if you want to see more images, find a 30 Park Place image and it will show you the rest). <a href=\"http:\/\/www.motherdesign.com\/filter\/3\/12-25-19\/1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>. <a href=\"http:\/\/bpando.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Spotted on BP&amp;O<\/a>.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Besides being a rather sophisticated collection of projects, this week&apos;s selections all have foil stamp as the connecting thread in work from Mexico, Budapest, and New York&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[1121,1065,115,53,1130],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3714"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3714"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3714\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3714"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3714"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3714"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
