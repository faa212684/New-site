The Shire of Toodyay agreed to the use and at no charge either. The City of Lubbock then proceeded to lop off a water-like appendage from the icon to now symbolize a windmill &mdash; as Lubbock has a strong windmill tradition and is home to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.windmill.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the Windmill Museum<\/a> &mdash; and then typed in their name. Above anything else, I am most perplexed by how the CFO of a Texas city is aware of the identity of an <em>area<\/em>, not even a city, on the other side of the world. But I guess this proves the old adage: Ask, and ye shall receive. &#8220;Hi, Apple? This is Armin Vit, Principal of UnderConsideration, I was wondering if I could borrow your logo? No?
