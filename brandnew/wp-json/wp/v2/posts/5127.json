The titular character, as designed by local design firm <a href=\"https:\/\/framecreative.com.au\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Frame<\/a>, is clearly a controller who is fat. Cartoonishly fat, with a top hat that not only looks boss on him but also makes him look like the boss of the place, which is a lair of metal fences and red neon lights. The thin-line drawings of the logo and additional illustrations are complemented with cool and energetic typography, all in the same color palette as the club itself. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/46425183\/Fat-Controller-Club\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a> <\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Gretas by 25AH<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_gretas.jpg\" alt=\"Gretas by 25AH\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.scandichotels.com\/hotels\/sweden\/stockholm\/haymarket-by-scandic\/restaurant-bar\/gretas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gretas<\/a> is a caf\u00e9 located in the Haymarket hotel in Stockholm with a self-described &#8220;modern interpretation of the 1920s&#8221;, which has been visualized in the identity by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.25ah.se\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">25AH<\/a>.

The script logo is okay, I wish it were less wispy or had a stronger presence. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.25ah.se\/project\/gretas\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Crude by Happycentro<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_crude.jpg\" alt=\"Crude by Happycentro\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">Crude is a new line of raw chocolate from Italian confectioner <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sabadi.it\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sabad\u00ed<\/a>. Designed by Verona, Italy-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.happycentro.it\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Happycentro<\/a>, the packaging mixes raw cardboard with different-colored foil stamping to create a beautiful contrast. I almost wrote, &#8220;I have no idea what the illustrations are meant to be&#8221; but luckily the coffee just kicked in and I realized that they are the cacao percentages of each bar (70, 80, 90, and 100), which makes for some stunning lettering. On the inside of the bars, yeah, I have no idea what <em>those<\/em> illustrations are meant to be but they look cool. The &#8220;UD&#8221; in the logo seems unnecessary as it doesn&#8217;t convey anything in particular about chocolate but, like the rest of the packaging, it looks cool. If close-ups of cardboard are as thrilling for you as eating chocolate is for me, then check the project link as there are a lot more photos. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.happycentro.it\/crude\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Some illustration-led projects this week with work from Adelaide, Stockholm, and Verona&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[880,882,1166],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5127"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=5127"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5127\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=5127"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=5127"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=5127"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
