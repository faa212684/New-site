Network Solutions pioneered domain registration but it also engendered some shady domain swooping practices like locking up any domains that were searched for availability but not purchased and, all things considered, they were a monopoly which is not the American way, and today you can register domain names pretty much anywhere in places whose name actually includes the word &#8220;daddy.&#8221; This past month, Network Solutions has been letting their customers know about <a href=\"http:\/\/preview.networksolutions.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">an upcoming change in identity and web design<\/a>. <\/p><!--more--><p>The old logo was anything but distinctive so it&#8217;s nice to see a bolder move to create something more memorable and unique. The &#8220;ns&#8221; monogram is the beginning of an interesting idea not perfectly executed; the folds give it a nice motion and the &#8220;s&#8221; works well but the &#8220;n&#8221; is a little too awkward to be convincing. I could probably live without the holding shape, but it&#8217;s not totally inappropriate. The typography, now in all lowercase, is techie without going overboard and has some nice details. Related to a recent review here, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/a_lendingtree_grows_in_the_web.php\">on Lending Tree<\/a>, this is a good counter-example of how to do the techie-look correctly without getting into bad clich&eacute;s. The overall effect of this redesign is very appropriate for the industry and space it lives in.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"red\">UPDATE:<\/span> The identity was designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pappasgroup.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pappas Group<\/a> in McLean, VA.<\/p>\n<h4>Thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jasonkeath.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jason Keath<\/a> for first tip.<br \/><br \/><\/h4>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_20090730_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_20090730_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_20090730_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_20090730_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,26,88],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/893"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=893"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/893\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=893"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=893"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=893"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
