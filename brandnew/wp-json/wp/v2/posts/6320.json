Housed in a massive neoclassical building that provides over 480,000 square feet of exhibit space, the museum hosts a number of permanent exhibits, rotating exhibits, a library, and space for more than 150 scientists in charge of the collections that include everything form <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fieldmuseum.org\/node\/5221\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">500,000 bird eggs<\/a> to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fieldmuseum.org\/node\/4961\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Javanese masks<\/a> to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fieldmuseum.org\/science\/research\/area\/focus-meteorites\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">meteorites<\/a> to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fieldmuseum.org\/node\/4791\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">30,000 records of Costa Rican fungi<\/a>.

This year, the museum&#8217;s 125th anniversary, is a galvanizing moment to clarify who we are, what we do and what we stand for.\u00a0At a time when people are coming together to acknowledge the importance of the scientific community, the Field is putting a stake in the ground as a forward-thinking leader in scientific discovery.\u00a0The new wordmark illustrates a purposeful change, helping transform the brand&#8217;s image from passive to active and strong.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/lbdod.com\/project\/field-museum-identity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Leo Burnett Department Of Design project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/field_museum_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Field Museum by Leo Burnett Department of Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>It all begins with the logo, rooted in one of the most reoccurring shapes found in our natural world: the square. It&#8217;s reminiscent of everything from archaeological excavation sites to the architectural details of the Field Museum building itself. Our logo includes two\u00a0squares: the\u00a0small square represents the fraction of the Museum&#8217;s collection on display,\u00a0while the large square, the logo itself, represents the museum&#8217;s massive collection as a whole. Its boldness conveys the massive impact the Museum has had on the community, city and world. Like the Earth, our color is blue. Blue embodies optimism and our constant effort to uncover solutions for a better world.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/lbdod.com\/project\/field-museum-identity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Leo Burnett Department Of Design project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video controls autoplay loop><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/field_museum_Logo-Animation_LOOP.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo animation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/field_museum_logo_as_window_anthro.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Field Museum by Leo Burnett Department of Design\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/field_museum_logo_as_window_botany.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Field Museum by Leo Burnett Department of Design\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/field_museum_logo_as_window_geology.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Field Museum by Leo Burnett Department of Design\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/field_museum_logo_as_window_zoology.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Field Museum by Leo Burnett Department of Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo-as-window for different subjects: Anthropology, botany, geology, and zoology.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo was quite bad, with a terribly spaced serif badly anchored on a clumsy line and using three inharmonious type sizes for each of the words in the name. The only good thing I have to say about it is that &#8220;Field&#8221; was large and that&#8217;s not saying much. The new logo is a full and drastic departure and introduces a very bold graphic device that&#8217;s almost a shock in how different it is. Visually, I kind of love it; the letters are bold, aligning neatly and leaving little rivers of counterspace flowing through them and I like how and where they placed &#8220;MUSEUM&#8221;. Conceptually and contextually I have a bit of a hard time seeing it as a logo for a natural history museum housed in what looks like a Greek temple but that&#8217;s probably decades of preconceptions at work. I really like the boldness of this and how the word is broken up &#8211; although I&#8217;m sure it will generate many &#8220;What&#8217;s a Fie Ld?&#8221; comments. The rationalization about the squares is a little flimsy but I&#8217;m a sucker for square logos, so I&#8217;ll buy it.<\/p>\n<p>The choice of the trendy blue as the primary color might be the most contentious thing for this crowd. I think it works well and even though it seems trendy as hell to most of us, this is pretty bold for a major mainstream museum that attracts millions of visitors a year for whom &#8220;There&#8217;s that blue again&#8221; has no meaning whatsoever and to whom the color will come across as bold, daring, and exciting, particularly in contrast to all the black and red museum logos.<\/p>\n<p>The logo-as-window approach&#8230; sure, why not? It works quite well with this particular structure as the counterspaces break the pictures in interesting ways and I like how &#8220;MUSEUM&#8221; stands out in white.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/field_museum_old_identity_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Field Museum by Leo Burnett Department of Design\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/field_museum_old_identity_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Field Museum by Leo Burnett Department of Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>OLD identity samples.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\" style=\"padding-bottom:67.25%\"><video controls autoplay loop><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/field_museum_Typeface_Animation_LOOP.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Typography.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video controls autoplay loop><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/field_museum_WordAnimation_Vimeo_2.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Tag line.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/field_museum_stationery.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Field Museum by Leo Burnett Department of Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stationery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/field_museum_brochures.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Field Museum by Leo Burnett Department of Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brochures.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/field_museum_magazine.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Field Museum by Leo Burnett Department of Design\" \/>\n<figcaption><em>In the Field<\/em> magazine.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/field_museum_postcards.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Field Museum by Leo Burnett Department of Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Postcards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/field_museum_various.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Field Museum by Leo Burnett Department of Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Various applications.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old identity looked really old, sad, and disjointed.
