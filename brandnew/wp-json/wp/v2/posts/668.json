Never quite shiny, nor the music loud enough and, if I remember correctly, they had a dopey running track going around all their stores. In an effort to position itself better, The Athlete&#8217;s has been trying to implement <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theathletesfoot.com\/innovative.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">&#8220;next generartion&#8221; stores<\/a> that their franchises are encouraged to adopt. Coupled with a new retail presence is a new logo and a push to be known for the odd acronym of &#8220;TAF.&#8221;<\/p><!--more--><p>I have always been a little yuck&#8217;d by their name, as when I hear athlete&#8217;s foot I think of stinky feet with nasty cuts and stuff, so the idea of buying footwear from a store named after a fungus has never been too enticing. Which is why I kind of understand the push to be colloquially known in a different way, but Taf (or taf, or TAF, or however they decide to spell it) just doesn&#8217;t sound cool enough to roll off the tongue like Champs or Foot Locker. But Taf it is. <\/p>\n<p>The new logo is a direct evolution from the old one and, unfortunately, that is not completely a good thing. The old logo had clunky typography and that red stroke around the blue that just seemed more appropriate for your local, small town pharmacy. Keeping Hermes&#8217; winged feet icon, the new logo is certainly bolder and tighter as a unit but all the elements feel completely different. The new winged foot is, in essence, a better drawing but the white stroke around it is too thin to make any difference when reduced and it&#8217;s uncomfortably positioned on top of the new Helvetica bold that just feels like it&#8217;s trying to escape. The good thing is that it now feels like a national, small pharmacy.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/taf_images.gif\" alt=\"Fun Images\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In another push to give Taf some more flair, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.brandweek.com\/bw\/content_display\/news-and-features\/packaging-and-design\/e3i3a02b4b8960ca28ab9f68bb708a5b57f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">they will be opening new kinds of stores called &#8220;tafUP&#8221;<\/a>, where the UP stands for Urban Premium and will specialize in sports fashion and urban wear. As it stands now, I don&#8217;t think the logo can support that kind of positioning. The only redeeming thing I&#8217;ve seen so far in this new identity are the promotional images above, which feel refreshingly different from what Champs or Foot Locker are doing &mdash; and employ the super chunky <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youworkforthem.com\/product.php?sku=t0133\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Black Slabbath<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.selikoffco.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jon Selikoff<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jerrykuyper.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jerry Kuyper<\/a> for the tip.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,86,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/668"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=668"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/668\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=668"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=668"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=668"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
