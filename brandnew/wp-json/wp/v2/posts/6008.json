Those numbers are kind of crazy but the impact of Kickstarter is undeniable and similar to other online platforms like Etsy, Uber, or Airbnb, it has allowed many people to earn a new kind of living through it. One example being Jesse Reed and Hamish Smyth who have launched a number of successful projects, including the New York City Transit Authority standards manual <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kickstarter.com\/projects\/thestandardsmanual\/full-size-reissue-of-the-nycta-graphics-standards\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reissue<\/a>, which led to other standards manual reissues, which led to a brick and mortar <a href=\"https:\/\/standardsmanual.com\/pages\/shop\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Standards Manual shop<\/a> in New York and the two designers to leave their Pentagram jobs to start <a href=\"http:\/\/www.order.design\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Order<\/a>&#8230; who teamed up with Kickstarter&#8217;s design team to design their new identity.<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kickstarter_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Kickstarter done In-house in Collaboration with Order\" \/>\n<figcaption>Wordmark.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kickstarter_logo_construction.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Kickstarter done In-house in Collaboration with Order\" \/>\n<figcaption>Wordmark construction.

That last gesture though, created a distracting imbalance in the wordmark, with two characters much heavier than all the rest for no apparent conceptual or even visual reason. The new wordmark &#8212; drawn by Brooklyn-based <a href=\"http:\/\/jesseragan.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jesse Ragan<\/a> &#8212; builds on those two characters to create a much more balanced design from start to finish, where all the letters have equal weight. As a long-time admirer of chunky typography, I absolutely love the update.<\/p>\n<p>The company&#8217;s name is so peculiar &#8212; part of it is its length, part of it that it has more &#8220;K&#8221;s than other company names &#8212; that it is easily recognizable even if the typography challenges readability standards and by &#8220;standards&#8221; I mean people&#8217;s laziness to decode anything that&#8217;s not typeset in Helvetica so even if this is &#8220;hard&#8221; to read, it&#8217;s still unequivocally Kickstarter. We complain about the overuse of jarring, vibrant colors but I do wonder if the transition to a new wordmark would have been better served by keeping the old green color instead of the new black\/green\/blue blend which I feel is a more drastic &#8212; and less beneficial &#8212; change than the shape of the letters. Still, I dig this very much and, more than anything, I absolutely love that Kickstarter didn&#8217;t go with the un-designed approach of recent redesigns &#8212; eBay, Dropbox, Remax, et al &#8212; but instead doubled down on the visual cues that made it different and unique.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kickstarter_monogram_before_after.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Kickstarter done In-house in Collaboration with Order\" \/>\n<figcaption>Monogram, before and after.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kickstarter_monogram_sizes.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Kickstarter done In-house in Collaboration with Order\" \/>\n<figcaption>Monogram in two different versions for normal and small size uses.

But, like the wordmark, I&#8217;m also liking this a lot and I appreciate there is a version for tiny uses.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kickstarter_color_palette.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Kickstarter done In-house in Collaboration with Order\" \/>\n<figcaption>Color palette.

Overall, as it may be clear, I think this is a great update that visually leans towards the more creative and quirky aspect of Kickstarter vs. the more business and bottom line aspect of it, which I think is a commendable approach for a company that espouses creativity and innovation.<\/p> ","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 2009, Kickstarter is a funding platform for creative projects where &#8212; as of this post&apos;s writing &#8212; 134,978 projects have been successfully funded, collectively backed by 14 million people who have pledged a combined $3.4 billion.
