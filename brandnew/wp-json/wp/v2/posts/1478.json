Its mission is to &#8220;improve the lives of this country&#8217;s newest generation of veterans and their families.&#8221; IAVA counts with 200,000 members &mdash; membership is free as they note that its members have &#8220;already paid [their] dues in Iraq and Afghanistan.&#8221; This week IAVA introduced a new identity designed pro bono by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.landor.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Landor<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>&#8220;We wanted to capture the dynamism of our members in an easily recognized symbol that for so many IAVA members is badge of honor and pride. They are an innovative generation&#8211;and this mark reflects that.  This identity is equally symbolic of a new social movement to rally the country and educate Americans about who we are and what we stand for as veterans. As the nation moves to close the chapter on these wars, we are more committed than ever to keeping the veterans&#8217; movement at the center of the national dialogue so all veterans and military families get the care and support they deserve. Like Livestrong did for cancer, we hope to do for vets.  Landor has been an incredible partner in this endeavor. Their team has set the standard for the rest of the corporate world to step up and serve this newest generation of veterans and their families.&#8221;<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/iava.org\/press-room\/press-releases\/iava-unveils-innovative-new-brand-identity-new-generation-veterans\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press Release<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<br \/>\n<iframe width=\"573\" height=\"326\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/P2locpg6X38?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<br \/><br \/>\n<p class=\"caption\">Logo introduction.<\/p>\n<iframe width=\"573\" height=\"326\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/oZbzo4kMIZE?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<br \/><br \/>\n<p class=\"caption\">Making of the new identity.

In contrast, the new logo is a fantastic mark that is unique, appropriate, and exciting for this group of veterans, and I&#8217;m thinking that these are not the stereotype of veterans we think of (very old and very wrinkled) but a young group from events that happened less than seven years ago. The new logo is a really excellent execution, making the best use of the military stencil clich&eacute; to create a contemporary astute wordmark that is bold, simple, and iconic.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to Kei Hoshino for the tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_110526_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_110526_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_110526_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_110526_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,79,26],"tags":[179,202,124,437],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1478"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1478"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1478\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1478"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1478"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1478"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
