The name, in the Maori language, means summit, apex, or highest point and the logo by Auckland-based <a href=\"http:\/\/inhousedesign.co.nz\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Inhouse<\/a> is a wonderful interpretation of the name as the &#8220;kit&#8221; letters ascend into a pointy peak with a strong diagonal. As much as I love that style of stencil &#8220;a&#8221; I wish it had a construction more similar to the &#8220;u&#8221; &mdash; the exaggerated serifs on it are also pretty great &mdash; so that all the letters felt more unified. In application, the logo is always used on the bottom so it looks like a mountain on the horizon and the reward for summiting it is a glass of Pinot. <a href=\"http:\/\/inhousedesign.co.nz\/project\/akitu\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project here<\/strong><\/a><\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Retrofutur by Chateau Batard<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_retrofutur.jpg\" alt=\"Retrofutur by Chateau Batard\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/retrofutur.fr\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Retrofutur<\/a> is a shop in Paris that specializes in audio equipment from speakers to headphones to vintage radios, and more. Now, I&#8217;m not 100% sure (perhaps not even 75% sure) that this new look is going to be implemented because the new logo is nowhere to be seen but the web sample in the case study matches quite closely the actual website, so I will take a leap of faith. Designed by Paris-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/chateaubatard\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Chateau Batard<\/a> the new logo is, or would be, a great evolution of the existing logo. I love the play with the letters of the &#8220;FUTUR&#8221; part going in reverse and the two &#8220;R&#8221;s mirroring each other and sandwiching the type on a curve, which has been really well done. The beehive-like icon is a nice mash-up of hipster and steampunk aesthetics and it extends well into the other product illustrations. Everything looks pretty Photoshop-y so it has to be taken with a grain of salt but it&#8217;s all very well considered. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/chateaubatard\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/25712991\/RetroFutur-Full-Identity-Webdesign\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Sagrante by Parallel<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_sagrante.jpg\" alt=\"Sagrante by Parallel\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Sagrante-Licor-de-Jamaica\/269279103221250\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sagrante<\/a> is a liqueur made in Mexico from <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hibiscus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hibiscus<\/a>, a popular ingredient for water juice (a la lemonade).

The icon is lovely and the accompanying Brandon Grotesque type is solid. On the bottle, I would have <em>really<\/em> loved to see the logo silkscreened in red instead of white but I am guessing someone was worried about legibility. Still, a nice, minimalist approach for a unique product. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.byparallel.com\/89747\/6521017\/portfolio\/sagrante-licor-de-jamaica\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Plenty of alcohol served this week, with work from Auckland, Paris, and Guadalajara&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[590,53,1133],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3974"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3974"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3974\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3974"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3974"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3974"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
