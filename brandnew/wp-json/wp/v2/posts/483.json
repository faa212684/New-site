Much has changed since their old wordmark was created so the update to the identity had to best represent the past, present, and future student body, faculty and staff. In February of 2006, Sockeye Creative was brought on board to create the new identity.<\/p>\n<p>The new mark is simply beautiful. It connects the university to the people: diverse, urban, community-centered, and educated. The mixture of typography with the interlocking PSU creates a very pleasant and functional mark. The mark utilizes a clever treatment with the serif and sans-serif typography which reflects the diversity of PSU. The interlocking mark also shows the strength and unity of the university. The application of the mark is very handsome as well, out in the world and online.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/portland_state_u_use.jpg\" alt=\"Portland State University Logo, In Use\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/portland_state_u_b1.jpg\" alt=\"Portland State University Logo, Online\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/portland_state_u_b2.jpg\" alt=\"Portland State University Logo, Online\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/portland_state_u_b3.jpg\" alt=\"Portland State University Logo, Online\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/portland_state_u_b4.jpg\" alt=\"Portland State University Logo, Online\" \/><\/p>\n<p>To learn more, see the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.marketing.pdx.edu\/tfim\/media\/Timeline.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">timeline of events [PDF]<\/a> or view the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.marketing.pdx.edu\/tfim\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">press release<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_hor_single.gif\" alt=\"End Post\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.feldhouse.net\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">John Feldhouse<\/a> graduated from Auburn University in 2005 and is currently working at Radiant Systems, a technology company based in Atlanta, GA. <\/strong><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":5,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,29,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/483"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/5"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=483"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/483\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=483"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=483"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=483"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
