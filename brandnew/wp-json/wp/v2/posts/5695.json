While the packaging is okay, all the materials, designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gcgmarketing.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GCG Marketing<\/a>, are what stood out and while much of it operates within tried-and-true hip graphic mannerisms, it all comes together quite nicely and convincingly to establish a renegade-light aesthetic for the vodka. The image of the posters alone gets the job done and there are some really nice executions in there and the gold and black color palette rarely fails. The most impressive part is that they have made black-eyed peas cool. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/54721633\/Blk-Eye-Branding\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Oroblanco by PUPILA<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_oroblanco.jpg\" alt=\"Oroblanco by PUPILA\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/oroblancocr\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Oroblanco<\/a> is a producer of kefir and kumis in Costa Rica, bringing the popular probiotic bacteria to their market.

This variety of surfaces served as a reference point for local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/primeiropedaco.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Est\u00fadio Primeiro Peda\u00e7o<\/a> to create an abstract graphic representation for each of the letters in the company&#8217;s name that could then be used as patterns throughout the identity. To be perfectly honest, I&#8217;m not entirely convinced by the applications &#8212;\u00a0much less by the serif chosen for the logo &#8212; but I found the letter abstractions to be really well thought out individually and how they work as a group. The rough texture achieved from cutting the patterns in linoleum and inking them add a nice tactility to the identity. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/primeiropedaco.com\/primus-decor\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Lots of textural work this week, with projects from Fort Worth, San Jos\u00e9, and S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[51,11,26],"tags":[39,769,1097],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5695"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=5695"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5695\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=5695"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=5695"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=5695"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
