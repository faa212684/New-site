We are often perceived by the general public as part of the so-called railways or historically connected with the Czech Railways. We want a simple way, through a clear logo, to present the importance and position of S\u017dDC,&#8221; says Jiri Svoboda, Deputy Director General of S\u017dDC. [&hellip;]<br \/><br \/>The current S\u017dDC logo has several forms with a number of unprofessional interventions, making it difficult to identify the organization correctly. It does not allow simple application in all graphical environments as well as in small sizes. Moreover, it does not cover all areas of activity of S\u017dDC. This is not covered by a regular license agreement.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.szdc.cz\/pro-media\/tiskove-zpravy\/nove-logo-szdc.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">S\u017dDC press release (Google-translated)<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/szdc_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for S\u017dDC by Studio Marvil\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The initial \u017d stylized as a rails scheme &#8211; three parallel railway tracks linked by a railroad switch.

The &#8220;\u017d&#8221; had a clever way of integrating the caron (the diacritic) and it would have been nice to see that attention to detail extended to the rest of the execution. Nonetheless, the old logo looked like a transportation logo &#8212; not the best at it but it got the point across. The new logo keeps the emphasis on the &#8220;\u017d&#8221; and creates a lovely and smart monogram that not only looks like a &#8220;\u017d&#8221; but clearly also represents a train track with a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=railway+switch&#038;lr=lang_en&#038;tbs=lr:lang_1en&#038;source=lnms&#038;tbm=isch&#038;sa=X&#038;ved=0ahUKEwi7r8mf1abVAhVmxlQKHXSZBFoQ_AUIBigB&#038;biw=1356&#038;bih=864\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">railway switch<\/a>. The extended width of the icon is quite nice and a very welcome change of pace from icons and monograms made to fit in a square for social media purposes. The wordmark, in Commercial Type&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/commercialtype.com\/catalog\/styrene\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Styrene<\/a>, is straightforward and has a bold, industrial, no-nonsense appearance that goes well with a rail management company.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/szdc_stationery.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for S\u017dDC by Studio Marvil\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stationery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/szdc_folders.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for S\u017dDC by Studio Marvil\" \/>\n<figcaption>Folders.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/szdc_badges.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for S\u017dDC by Studio Marvil\" \/>\n<figcaption>Badges.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/szdc_ad.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for S\u017dDC by Studio Marvil\" \/>\n<figcaption>Ad.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>All the applications are renders and it remains to be seen whether these get produced as ambitiously as they are presented here. If yes, then this will look great. I love how the monogram is used full bleed in some of the applications, reinforcing the idea that you are looking at a segment of railroad tracks. Just as well, it looks great small. The multi-line, swoopy pattern used above, and in the logo animation, is cool to look at but somehow it&#8217;s too fuzzy or too delicate with the rest of the boldness around it.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/szdc_train_old.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for S\u017dDC by Studio Marvil\" \/>\n<figcaption>Existing livery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/szdc_train_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for S\u017dDC by Studio Marvil\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/szdc_train_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for S\u017dDC by Studio Marvil\" \/>\n<figcaption>Livery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/szdc_containers.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for S\u017dDC by Studio Marvil\" \/>\n<figcaption>Containers.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/szdc_flags.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for S\u017dDC by Studio Marvil\" \/>\n<figcaption>Flags.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">Again, it&#8217;s hard to tell how hardcore the implementation will be, but if the sad yellow trains with the existing livery change to these bad-ass orange and blue designs, they are going to be some fine-looking trains worth Czech-ing out.
