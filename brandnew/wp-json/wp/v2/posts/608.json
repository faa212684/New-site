Certainly things have changed. But I do remember (on the times when I wasn&#8217;t too imbibed) those Saturdays fondly. So it&#8217;s with a slight zeal of nostalgia that I turn my attention to Starz, with its flagship (at least for me) Saturday premieres that were somewhere between Pay-per-view and HBO &mdash; not quite first on TV, but not six months after a movie had been released in theaters. This was ten years ago, when Starz had an exclamation point at the end of it (Starz!) and it had only one channel &#038;mdashl for a comprehensive look at the past identities and exclamation point particulars <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Starz\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wikipedia has a nice round-up<\/a>. Certainly, things have changed for the Starz as well. It is now a six-channel network with HD and On Demand alternatives &mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/starz.mediaroom.com\/index.php?s=43&#038;item=832\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">and $25 million allocated for a comprehensive campaign, along with a shiny new logo<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><p>The logo and identity were designed by Darwin (impossible to find a link to them), in partnership with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.designandimage.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Design and Image Communications<\/a>. While it must have been tempting, for both client and designer, to go with another star spangled logo I like that they instead opted for an allusion of a star &mdash; with a shine coming through the &#8220;a&#8221; and &#8220;r&#8221;, let&#8217;s call it &#8220;The Shining&#8221; for now. I also enjoy the customization of the wordmark, with its ultra tight letter spacing and well resolved counterspaces, even if the &#8220;z&#8221; has a speed racing look to it that the other characters don&#8217;t have; it also makes it proprietary and distinctive. It&#8217;s a simple logo with a sturdy concept &mdash; which comes alive in the on-air idents developed by TV powerhouse <a href=\"http:\/\/www.troika.tv\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Troika<\/a>. The animations use The Shining to great effect, making it the focal point of the logo, with all sorts of light and supernovas filtering through it. Below are a few stills, but you can see the animations at Troika&#8217;s web site.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/starz_id_03.jpg\" alt=\"Starz Ident Still\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/starz_id_05.jpg\" alt=\"Starz Ident Still\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/starz_id_04.jpg\" alt=\"Starz Ident Still\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/starz_id_07.jpg\" alt=\"Starz Ident Still\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/starz_id_09.jpg\" alt=\"Starz Ident Still\" \/><\/p>\n<p>I really like this new identity and on-air package, I like that it is not trying too hard to be clever or hip, and it has a certain authority to it that places it in a more competitive category with HBO or Showtime. The advertising campaign is being developed by <a href=\"http:\/\/kbpwest.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">kirshenbaum bond + partners<\/a>, but I haven&#8217;t seen any executions. It&#8217;s refreshing too, to see a congruent result coming from four separate creative teams &mdash; pending on the advertising look, of course. So, today, my Saturday routine involves diaper-changing, laundry-folding, playground-trolling, if I&#8217;m lucky, one or two hours of TV, an early bedtime of 10:30, certainly no nightclubbing, which is fine by my actually&hellip; but I do miss a good feature presentation. Happy to see Starz is still around.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,66,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/608"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=608"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/608\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=608"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=608"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=608"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
