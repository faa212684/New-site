The combined power, staff, inventory and line of products has created the world&#8217;s largest brewer, representing powerhouse consumer brands like Budweiser, Stella Artois, Beck&#8217;s and Bass, and in addition, the new company has a 50% ownership of Mexico&#8217;s Grupo Modelo which sells the relaxing Corona, and they have a 27% share in China&#8217;s Tsingtao which produces its delicious eponymous beer.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ab-inbev_logo_detail.jpg\" alt=\"Anheuser-Busch InBev Logo, Detail\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ab-inbev_logo_detail_bw.jpg\" alt=\"Anheuser-Busch InBev Logo, Detail in Black and White\" \/><\/p>\n<blockquote>The new Anheuser-Busch InBev identity reflects the vision of our new organization, with our guiding principles at the very heart of its conception. It is designed to represent drive, authenticity and friendship.<br \/><br \/>[&hellip;]<br \/><br \/>Reflecting the rich heritage of both companies, the eagle represents strength, agility and focus, while at the same time looking forward and upwards to reflect our collective vision, drive and energy.<br \/><br \/>[&hellip;]<br \/><br \/>The combination of rich golden colors captures what we know and do best: our expertise and heritage in brewing great beer, which is so often a part of enjoyable moments shared by friends.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ab-inbev.com\/logo_background.cfm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">About our New Identity<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p>It&#8217;s very interesting that the new logo is unabashedly American, building on the equity of the old Anheuser-Busch logo. The latter makes sense as the InBev logo, aside from being ugly and completely inappropriate for a brewer, it had no more than four years of presence and equity, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.anheuser-busch.com\/historyAEagle.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">while the eagle has been part of Anheuser-Busch&#8217;s identity since 1872<\/a>; but for a global company, this seems to rooted in American flavor. Even the typography leans towards this side of the pond. Regardless, the logo isn&#8217;t particularly interesting: It&#8217;s just some type with the illustration of an eagle. There is no tension, nothing to grab your attention, nor anything memorable about it, it&#8217;s simply a corporate logo. <\/p>\n<p>Maybe after knocking back a few Buds, the logo will look more attractive.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Thanks to Casey Auv&eacute; for first tip.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[12,86,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/728"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=728"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/728\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=728"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=728"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=728"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
