It was the first ride-share and ride-hail company, becoming the default verb and noun for the industry in the same way Google did for search engines &#8212; even if you are taking a Lyft, you are Uber-ing. The past couple of years, though, have been pretty darn horrible for Uber with bad press resulting from its business practices, culture, and overall appreciation that made some people riding Uber feel complicit in their bad behavior. (I, for one, switched to Lyft and I&#8217;m not a huge protester of corporations but Uber felt particularly icky.) With the ousting of its CEO, Travis Kalanick, over a year ago, Uber has been on a transition phase to become a respectable company under the leadership of Dara Khosrowshahi as it grapples with its immense growth over its nearly ten years of existence. Uber has 16,000 employees; 3 million drivers; 75 million riders; and completes over 15 million trips <em>each day<\/em> in more than 600 cities in 65 countries. The numbers are quite overwhelming. Last week, Uber introduced a new identity designed by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wolffolins.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wolff Olins<\/a> in collaboration with Uber&#8217;s Brand Team.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>Uber operates in 660+ cities globally. The brand needed to work around the world. Its highest growth areas are in regions outside of the US, such as Latin America and India, where Wolff Olins has a considerable depth of experience. Instead of pursuing a complex identity system, localized through color and pattern, we moved towards a universal &#8216;beyond-simple&#8217; global brand. Teams in diverse markets can make it relevant to their audiences with culturally specific content.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wolffolins.com\/case-studies\/uber\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wolff Olins project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/uber_2018_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Uber by Wolff Olins and In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>Our logo is approachable, easy to read, and takes full advantage of our name recognition. Optical kerning, refined weight, and defined clear space, as well as well delineated placement in relation to other content, all help to make it as instantly recognizable as possible.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.uber.design\/case-studies\/rebrand-2018\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Uber Design case study<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/uber_2018_logo_animation.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo animation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>As you may remember, Uber&#8217;s old logo is not that old: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/new_logo_and_identity_for_uber_done_in_house.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">it was introduced in February of 2016<\/a>. As you may remember as well, it was a complete train wreck. Possibly one of the worst redesigns in the history of misguided redesigns. I considered wrapping that previous statement in some form of sarcastic sentence but, for the record, it should be clear as day that the previous logo and everything that came with it was, quite literally, the worst. Coinciding with that redesign was also the start of Uber&#8217;s problems, which made that redesign exercise seem like one more manifestation of the internal problems. This new design is the most clear-cut example in recent memory of a company introducing a new logo to signal change and move away from very recent, very scandalous press. Most redesigns we have seen in recent years are part of positive momentum and while Uber surely has some of that going in its favor, this logo&#8217;s primary job is try to get as many people as possible to put as much of Uber&#8217;s past in the past.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not even worth going into the weaknesses of the old wordmark and &#8220;bit&#8221; icon because there were so many not just graphically but conceptually. The new logo is a definite line in the sand that moves Uber into a more positive and accessible aesthetic that puts functionality and practicality first and eschews trying to make any bold statements that could be misinterpreted at a point where anything the company does would come under scrutiny. At first glance, the new logo is&#8230; nothing. It is the most bare-bones rendition possible of a company name. It barely registers as a logo. It makes <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/new_logo_for_google_done_in_house.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google&#8217;s logo<\/a> feel like Times Square on New Year&#8217;s Eve. This new logo also marks the apex of the extreme simplification trend in logos that we&#8217;ve been seeing in the past year or two and manages to take it to the farthest end of that spectrum. You might disagree with me: but it&#8217;s actually perfect.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not a perfect logo. It&#8217;s a perfect logo for Uber &#8212; now. To me, one of its biggest achievements, especially in the U.S. market, is that it&#8217;s the opposite of Lyft. It draws a clear distinction and establishes Uber as the more professional, robust, and straightforward option of the two. It may potentially also communicate an unwelcome coldness that contrasts negatively from the warmth and friendliness implied in the Lyft brand and its drivers but, as long as Uber and its drivers stay on the straight and narrow, the associations should become positive.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/uber_2018_logo_vs_lyft.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Uber by Wolff Olins and In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Head to head with the Lyft logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The new logo does away with any decoration, with any implication, with any hint at taking a side, and simply states the name of the company in a way that is as generally accessible as possible for as many people as possible in as many cities as possible. It&#8217;s a logo for everyone and no one. In its four-letter simplicity and shortness &#8212; assuming they stick with it for more than two years &#8212; the logo has the potential to be as recognizable, at small and large sizes, as the Nike swoosh. It may not be as cool, not by any means, but, more importantly, it may be as easy to identify. And once you get over the shocking level of simplicity, the logo is actually quite nice and as masterfully done in this realm as possible. Giving the uppercase &#8220;U&#8221; a lowercase design with a stem is a quiet but interesting detail that pairs quite well with the &#8220;b&#8221; to its right and the &#8220;r&#8221; at the end, while the &#8220;b&#8221; and &#8220;e&#8221; provide two strong circular shapes in the center. I know this logo is very difficult to digest without sarcasm but, if you are able to, there is good deal of craftsmanship at work here that will serve this logo well in the long run.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/uber_2018_app_icon_before_after.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Uber by Wolff Olins and In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>App icon, before and after.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/uber_2018_logo_in_shapes.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Uber by Wolff Olins and In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo in various social media avatar shapes.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>One of the best decisions in this redesign is NOT introducing a &#8220;U&#8221; monogram AND getting rid of the meaningless icon introduced in 2016 as the app icon and social media avatars. This is ultimately what will cement the new logo in people&#8217;s minds. Take a moment to update your phone&#8217;s apps if they haven&#8217;t updated automatically, and seriously judge the new logo in that environment. It looks damn great. Don&#8217;t judge my app selection but <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/uber_2018_app_armin_phone.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">look at the immediate contrast<\/a> the new logo generates next to all the other app icons that are trying to fill every pixel available. It&#8217;s easy to spot and it sits there with a new sense of sophistication that Uber never had.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/uber_2018_logo_in_application_a.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Uber by Wolff Olins and In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo in application.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>With a new wave of leadership at Uber came a renewed commitment to safety. So far, that safety focus has been product-driven. We knew the brand needed to speak equally to riders, drivers, and employees, so we took a step back and asked, &#8220;What does safety mean for different people at different times?&#8221; We introduced Safety Blue to the color palette. It&#8217;s unique to Uber and meant to be used sparingly to indicate important moments of support, care, or connection between the user and the brand.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wolffolins.com\/case-studies\/uber\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wolff Olins project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/uber_2018_color_palette.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Uber by Wolff Olins and In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Color palette.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>Safety blue is unique to Uber.

Adding the burst of blue seems like a good choice. Nothing about it stands out too positively or negatively and, mostly, it contrasts well with either black or white.
