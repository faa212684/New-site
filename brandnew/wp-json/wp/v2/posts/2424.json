The California Golden Bears (or just &#8220;Cal&#8221;) have won 82 national team titles in 15 different sports over its history and are consistently one of the winningest teams across all universities in the U.S., and its students have accrued 159 Olympic medals, 91 of which are gold, as participants in the Games. Last week, Cal introduced a new identity and uniforms designed by Nike&#8217;s Graphic Identity Group. (Yes, them again).<\/p><!--more--><p><iframe width=\"574\" height=\"323\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/8V7FgZNyNG0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Jason Kidd, Cal alumnus, <em>is<\/em> impressed with the new logo.<\/p>\n<blockquote>Among the changes fans will see are uniforms that portray a coherent theme throughout all sports, consistent use of Cal&#8217;s blue and gold colors across a wide range of platforms from uniforms and team performance gear to signage and advertising, as well as a new Bear logo that comes alive with renewed spark and energy. However, one significant element will not be altered: the Golden Bears&#8217; most enduring and iconic mark &mdash; the script Cal &mdash; will continue as the primary logo for all of the University&#8217;s intercollegiate athletic teams.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.calbears.com\/ot\/unifythebears_logos.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cal logo unveil site<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cal_berkeley_athletics_bear_detail.gif\" alt=\"University of California Athletic Department Logo and Uniforms\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Officially, the secondary mark.<\/p>\n<blockquote>The Cal Script logo is iconic and distinct.

To assist in creating a consistent look for a wide variety of athletic communications, a custom display typeface and numeral set has been designed as an enhancement to the overall identity. The progressive letterforms are a contemporary approach to designing a condensed san-serif alphabet.

A surprisingly good, succinct primer of what &#8220;brand&#8221; is in the opening minutes.<\/p>\n<p>Of the recent spate of Nike-designed identities this has been the least interesting for me. The Beavers had an interesting logo and great uniforms and the Bulldogs had decent typography. With the Cal Bears, although a definite improvement over the previous bear hugging a circle, the effort felt like back to basics, especially with the typography that, despite going for simple, becomes a mushy condensed mess. Just look at the &#8220;ORNI&#8221; in &#8220;CALIFORNIA&#8221;, that is some overly tight stuff. The new bear&hellip; sure, it&#8217;s angry and menacing but it doesn&#8217;t really do anything no other snarling bear has done before. As usual, the uniforms are slick, and the detail I love on Cal&#8217;s uniforms is the ghosted bear inside the number of the football uniform. Overall, it&#8217;s fine.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cal_berkeley_athletics_unis_01.jpg\" alt=\"University of California Athletic Department Logo and Uniforms\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cal_berkeley_athletics_unis_02.jpg\" alt=\"University of California Athletic Department Logo and Uniforms\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cal_berkeley_athletics_unis_03.jpg\" alt=\"University of California Athletic Department Logo and Uniforms\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cal_berkeley_athletics_unis_04.jpg\" alt=\"University of California Athletic Department Logo and Uniforms\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cal_berkeley_athletics_unis_05.jpg\" alt=\"University of California Athletic Department Logo and Uniforms\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.oddworks.net\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Philip Ariza<\/a> for first tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_130416_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_130416_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_130416_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_130416_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_130416_config_03.xml&#038;xyz=poll_130416_votes_03.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv3\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv3\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,26,87],"tags":[117,860,273,233,270,35],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2424"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2424"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2424\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2424"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2424"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2424"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
