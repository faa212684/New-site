This past November, The Rainbow Society changed its name to The Dream Factory and introduced a new identity designed by Winnipeg-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cocoonbranding.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cocoon Branding<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>The airship logo design was inspired by the organization&#8217;s new positioning line: &#8220;Sometimes kids deserve to get carried away.&#8221; The Dream Factory helps kids forget about their illness &mdash; even just for a moment &mdash; and encourages them to get carried away in the anticipation of having their dream come true, the experience itself, and the memories they will keep with them when they return to their routine of doctors, treatments, and hospital visits.<br \/>&mdash; Text provided by Cocoon<\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/dream_factory_DRE-Identity-1colour.jpg\" width=\"574\" alt=\"The Dream Factory\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/dream_factory_DRE-Identity.jpg\" width=\"574\" alt=\"The Dream Factory\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Logo in one and full color.<\/p>\n<p>I mentioned the Make-A-Wish Foundation because when I first saw the new identity, before reading anything about the The Dream Factory, I assumed this was a large, national organization helping thousands of kids a year, much like Make-A-Wish. That&#8217;s a significant thing for an identity to do. I was surprised to see it was a small organization, which the old logo supported and didn&#8217;t do it any favors in making it look like a solid organization nor did it make any allusions whatsoever to what it did.<\/p>\n<p>The new logo and identity aren&#8217;t perfect but they make an immediate statement that is relevant and uplifting. I really like the concept of the airship and building its balloon from the word Dream. There is a slight disconnect between that bold typography and the thin script used for &#8220;The&#8221; and &#8220;factory&#8221; and those sit a little too close to the blue stroke. The ship part of the logo is downright adorable, it just looks like a little-train-that-could, pulling at that big balloon. Even the way it&#8217;s positioned and rotated you can read into it that it&#8217;s like the children they help, optimistically pushing forward.<\/p>\n<p>The rest of the identity is nice and playful, I even like the blue to cream gradient, but the typography in the business cards and even on the website lacks the sophistication and attention to detail that the logo has. A few less type-on-a-curve and a better typeface selection would improve this plenty. Overall, a great redesign and renaming.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/dream_factory_DRE-Stationery.jpg\" width=\"574\" alt=\"The Dream Factory\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/dream_factory_DRE-BusCards.jpg\" width=\"574\" alt=\"The Dream Factory\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/dream_factory_DRE-BusCards2.jpg\" width=\"574\" alt=\"The Dream Factory\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Stationery and business card detail.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/dream_factory_DRE-FolderCover.jpg\" width=\"574\" alt=\"The Dream Factory\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/dream_factory_DRE-FolderDown.jpg\" width=\"574\" alt=\"The Dream Factory\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/dream_factory_Folderopen2.jpg\" width=\"574\" alt=\"The Dream Factory\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/dream_factory_DRE-foldercardinlay.jpg\" width=\"574\" alt=\"The Dream Factory\" \/><\/p>\n<blockquote>The pop-up corporate folder became a highlight piece to be given to dream children and prospective donors. This folder will often be the first connection that the brand will have, and needed to hold the essence of the organization as well as keep the aspect of the surreal feeling of a dream. A pop-up book was the perfect vehicle for this. The pop-up also holds the various collateral that the folder will need to carry.<\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/dream_factory_DRE-Balloons.jpg\" width=\"574\" alt=\"The Dream Factory\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/dream_factory_DRE-Icecream.jpg\" width=\"574\" alt=\"The Dream Factory\" \/><\/p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/32481376\" width=\"574\" height=\"323\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Behind the scenes video.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_120202_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_120202_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_120202_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_120202_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,79,26],"tags":[39,476,54],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1824"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1824"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1824\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1824"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1824"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1824"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
