And that&#8217;s it, there is not much else to say in the introduction other than acknowledging that a single-location boutique hotel would usually be Friday Likes content instead of a Monday Review but the project scope is quite extensive and entertaining. The identity for the hotel has been designed by Honolulu, HI-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.walltowall.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wall-to-Wall Studios<\/a> with interiors by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thevanguardtheory.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Vanguard Theory<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>Taking inspiration from the heyday of Hawaiian hospitality, the Surfjack logo and brand elements pay homage to an era where corporate identity was truly crafted by hand, including illustrations, icons and typography created by W|W. [&hellip;] W|W developed a comprehensive look-and-feel across all touch points, including the corporate identity system, hotel guest collateral, check-in packet, &#8220;do not disturb&#8221; signs, online and offline advertising, visual merchandising, website design, main hotel signage, plus the &#8220;Swim Club&#8221; name, concept and membership materials.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.walltowall.com\/pages\/surfjack\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wall-to-Wall Studios project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/surfjack_logo.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Surfjack by Wall-to-Wall Studios\" \/>\n<figcaption>Primary logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/surfjack_logo_alternates.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Surfjack by Wall-to-Wall Studios\" \/>\n<figcaption>Alternate logos and elements.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/surfjack_logo_alternates_with_photos.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Surfjack by Wall-to-Wall Studios\" \/>\n<figcaption>Alternate logos with feel-good photos.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Even though it&#8217;s for a boutique hotel in Hawaii and this looser, joyful aesthetic is to be expected, it&#8217;s still nice to see something unhinged from the typical logo and identity work we&#8217;ve been seeing all year long that, as nice as it is, it can get repetitive. The main logo has a great surfer vibe and it could easily pass as some unassuming lettering on any number of surf-related t-shirts sold anywhere which isn&#8217;t meant to downplay the logo but to say how organic it feels to a relaxed-beach culture.The harsh, rough letters bounce up and down and create a strong rhythm for the main logo. The secondary elements all add to the charm and get their moment in the sun in different applications.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/surfjack_stationery.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Surfjack by Wall-to-Wall Studios\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stationery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/surfjack_keycard.gif\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Surfjack by Wall-to-Wall Studios\" \/>\n<figcaption>Keycard.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/surfjack_sign.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Surfjack by Wall-to-Wall Studios\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sign.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/surfjack_signage.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Surfjack by Wall-to-Wall Studios\" \/>\n<figcaption>Room numbers and other stuff.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/surfjack_website.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Surfjack by Wall-to-Wall Studios\" \/>\n<figcaption>Website.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/surfjack_collateral_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Surfjack by Wall-to-Wall Studios\" \/>\n<figcaption>Various collateral.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/surfjack_postcards.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Surfjack by Wall-to-Wall Studios\" \/>\n<figcaption>Postcards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/surfjack_room_guide.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Surfjack by Wall-to-Wall Studios\" \/>\n<figcaption>Room guide.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The applications follow a vibe more than a standard set of rules and everything has a wonderful flexibility to it that isn&#8217;t necessarily consistent but definitely conveys a sense of place and attitude.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/surfjack_coffee.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Surfjack by Wall-to-Wall Studios\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/surfjack_coffee_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Surfjack by Wall-to-Wall Studios\" \/>\n<figcaption>Coffee and pennant.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/surfjack_merch_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Surfjack by Wall-to-Wall Studios\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/surfjack_merch_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Surfjack by Wall-to-Wall Studios\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/surfjack_merch_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Surfjack by Wall-to-Wall Studios\" \/>\n<figcaption>Merchandise.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/surfjack_pool.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Surfjack by Wall-to-Wall Studios\" \/>\n<figcaption>Pool.
