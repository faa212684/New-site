Yes, there are better ways. Truth is, and snarkiness aside, Martha Stewart&#8217;s empire seems like it never missed a beat, and this new identity is so in tune with the &#8220;Martha Look&#8221; that its evolution is as seamless and easy-looking as making squirrel-shaped centerpieces out of cloth napkins.<\/p><!--more--><p>The new identity was designed by long-time MS collaborator Stephen Doyle of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.doylepartners.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Doyle Partners<\/a> in New York, who has been working with them since 1997. In good MS fashion, the identity is deceptively simple and elegant and anyone that has ever tried to set type in a circle can appreciate the improbability of pulling such a feat with the qualities mentioned above. An aspect I find interesting in this change is the segue into opposites: From an authoritative and demanding sans serif to a soft and sophisticated &#8220;quasi serif&#8221;, and from a hard-edged rectangle to a friendlier circle. All the while, turning an otherwise lackluster light teal\/aqua color into a digestible color. The new logo &mdash; described by Doyle as a &#8220;welcoming wreath&#8221; &mdash; is set to &#8220;soon grace most of [Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia] properties&#8221;&hellip; <em>Grace<\/em>. Exactly. <\/p>\n<p>PS. I particularly like and prefer the identity as applied in the spines of the image below, without the enclosing circles.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/martha_stewart_spines.jpg\" alt=\"Martha Stewart Logo Application\" \/>\n<span class=\"small\"><strong>Image Source: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.doylepartners.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Doyle Partners<\/a>.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/martha_stewart_floor.jpg\" alt=\"Martha Stewart Logo on the Floor\" \/>\n<span class=\"small\"><strong>Image Source: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.doylepartners.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Doyle Partners<\/a>.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,75,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/472"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=472"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/472\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=472"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=472"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=472"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
