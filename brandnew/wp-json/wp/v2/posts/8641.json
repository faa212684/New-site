Some can be heard with the naked ear, and others only with the help of specialized recording equipment, but through Imogen&#8217;s unique process these simple sounds become extraordinary instruments in a signature musical score.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/thought-leadership\/imogen-heap\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">IBM project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/383134649?title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"360\" height=\"203\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Introduction video about the collaboration with Imogen Heap.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>London-based design agency FIELD worked with Imogen and IBM to transform the layers of data within Imogen&#8217;s composition into a new visual language.<br \/><br \/>Synesthesia is a condition in which one sense, such as hearing, is simultaneously perceived by another, such as sight. The design team built a visual engine that is driven directly by Imogen&#8217;s musical data. The results are unique visual compositions that move and respond to the data within the song, creating a synesthetic visual effect.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/thought-leadership\/imogen-heap\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">IBM project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/408338260?title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"360\" height=\"203\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<hr \/>\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/408338147?title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"360\" height=\"203\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Think 2020 compositions.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">While all of the animations and metaphors in the previous years have had a degree of abstraction they all made references to tangible things and concepts (magnetism, topography, etc.). The 2020 look is purely abstract and is a wonderful visualization of the equally abstract sounds captured by Imogen &#8212; you can listen to some of the individual sounds <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/thought-leadership\/imogen-heap\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a> &#8212; at IBM&#8217;s offices in New York. The compositions, as they react to sound, are hypnotic and engaging, all in a very pleasing color palette. It&#8217;s a shame this won&#8217;t get a full event roll-out as it would have been quite the sight&#8230; and sound.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 2018, Think is an annual conference by IBM that, at the time, consolidated various smaller events into what is now a bigger business and technology conference experience showcasing the company&apos;s latest innovations, insights, and expertise.
