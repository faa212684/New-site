Forced to sell after a government review came to the conclusion that one operator owning every airport in town was uncompetitive, the new owners turned to the experienced hands of branding consultancy <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lewismoberly.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lewis Moberly<\/a>. <\/p><!--more--><p>The previous logo was, not to put too fine a point on it, pretty terrible &mdash; exactly as you&#8217;d expect from a monopoly. A confusing jumble of typefaces and type hierarchy, with an anonymous and generic mark, it looked exactly like an airport run by a conglomerate with no competition and no reason to try. The new type-based mark is but one step in the right direction, when perhaps a long haul flight was needed. Take away that tag line and one could be forgiven for thinking Gatwick is a toothpaste or a lady&#8217;s sanitary product. The curvy, signature-esque type seems entirely inappropriate for an airport, but it must be conceded that it makes sense from a strategic point of view. The new owners are doing everything they can to create a clean break from the past, and a less than stellar reputation amongst London travelers. But in trying to lose their stigma as a bad airport, the new identity loses all semblance of an airport at all.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/gatwick_planeSmiling.gif\" width=\"574\" height=\"191\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Some of the imagery popping through Gatwick&#8217;s website.<\/p>\n<p>From what little could be gleaned of the new identity in action, it appears the flowing curves of the logo are extrapolated out to the air stream of a jet in flight, and this stream creates the passing resemblance of a smile. Linking airports with smiling is a dangerous association to deliver on, and a feat to achieve. Indeed Sydney airport, courtesy of a repugnant idea from Frost Design, have resorted to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.easepft.com.au\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">inventing fake mental illnesses<\/a>. So at least Gatwick has that going for it, it can&#8217;t be accused of inventing fake illnesses. However they are responsible for spreading other blights on modern society, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=XRL55ZmI9R4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fake tans<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=zYp6wwqf1To\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">modeling competitions<\/a>.
