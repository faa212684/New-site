Their portfolio consists of 21 shopping centers (malls) in the UK and France &#8212; including the UK&#8217;s first covered mall in 1976 &#8212; 19 retail parks in the UK, and 15 outlets across Europe, for a combined retail space of 7.2 million square feet (2.2 million square meters). Long operating behind the scenes and as B2B brand, Hammerson is making a concerted effort to make its name better known amongst consumers and gain more brand recognition, starting with a new identity designed by London-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pentagram.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pentagram<\/a> partner Harry Pearce.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>The masterbrand is centred on the logotype&#8217;s hidden H, that gives Hammerson a strong presence, whilst still giving individual centres and surrounding communities a sense of ownership. The invisible H makes clear Hammerson&#8217;s quiet personality but essential role.<br \/><br \/>The new identity is purposefully European, reflecting Hammerson&#8217;s presence in the UK and France. The H is both a logotype and symbol, which is adapted for all asset brands. New branding has been created for each centre and retail park, featuring an invisible H next to the centre name, with the location beneath it. This creates continuity throughout all the centres, without imposing Hammerson&#8217;s name of them.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.pentagram.com\/#\/blog\/132717\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pentagram project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hammerson_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Hammerson by Pentagram\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>I wish the old logo had been for a range of office printers or a commercial printer because then it would have been perfect. The halftone pattern on the mobius strip icon was <a href=\"http:\/\/underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hammerson_logo_old_detail.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">nicely done<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20150207002842\/http:\/\/hammerson.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">it reduced<\/a> effectively into an apparent gradient. Even the &#8220;mm&#8221; ligature was cool but maybe more fitting for something to do with software. (Here is the old identity on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/885723\/Hammerson-corporate-identity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Behance<\/a>.) So, good logo but not the right fit for a developer of shopping centers.<\/p>\n<p>The new logo is more fit for the company by having less personality &#8212; not in a bad way &#8212; and, in turn, being more adaptable to the myriad properties it&#8217;s involved in. The big, hidden &#8220;H&#8221; is a sophisticated visual trick that should be easy enough to decipher by anyone willing or anyone wondering why a logo is made up of two giant squares. It&#8217;s a rare logo in today&#8217;s modus operandi in that it has a giant monogram and a sideways wordmark (which uses the OG of geometric sans serifs, Futura) instead of the usual small icon and Circular. I really like the new logo and how the &#8220;H&#8221; becomes ever more apparent in application.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hammerson_logo_properties.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Hammerson by Pentagram\" \/>\n<figcaption>&#8220;H&#8221; monogram with property names and their location.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The extension to other property names is not as successful as the logo, though, where the Hammerson name reinforces the &#8220;H&#8221; &#8212; it&#8217;s only if you know where the two giant squares come from that the above image would make sense. Otherwise it starts looking like a bad 1980s brochure with odd graphic elements. This usage probably has value in a brochure for investors or B2B audience when seen in the context of the overall Hammerson presentation as opposed to this being the connecting visual thread that has shoppers realize, &#8220;Oh, look honey, Brent Cross is owned by the same company with the hidden H logo as O&#8217;Parinor &#8212; thank you Hammerson!&#8221;.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hammerson_publications.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Hammerson by Pentagram\" \/>\n<figcaption>Publications.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hammerson_magazinea_ad.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Hammerson by Pentagram\" \/>\n<figcaption>Print ad.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hammerson_board_ads.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Hammerson by Pentagram\" \/>\n<figcaption>Ground billboard.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hammerson_brochure.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Hammerson by Pentagram\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hammerson_brochure_detail.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Hammerson by Pentagram\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brochure.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">In application the logo benefits from context and placement that allow the &#8220;H&#8221; to come forward &#8212; the publications image, for example, is particularly good. The logo comes across as bold and confident but also serious and sophisticated. The one complaint I have about the application is that it&#8217;s a heck of a lot of Futura: Futura logo, Futura headlines, Futura subheadlines, Futura body copy&#8230; if they could control it, the source code of the website would probably be Futura. It&#8217;s not the worst thing that could happen but it&#8217;s like hitting the same seven keys on a piano over and over. Nonetheless, it&#8217;s a well-crafted identity anchored by a catchy logo.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1942, Hammerson is an owner, manager, and developer of retail destinations in Europe.
