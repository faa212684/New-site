Slowly deteriorating, and slightly frumpy next to these buildings, the FWMSH is currently undergoing a renovation under <a href=\"http:\/\/www.legorretalegorreta.com\/lego_new\/proyectos_detalle.php?id=122\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the design of Mexico City based Ricardo Legorreta&#8217;s Legorreta + Legorreta<\/a> that will open 202 days from now (according to the web site&#8217;s counter).<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fort_worth_museum_render.jpg\" alt=\"Forth Worth Museum of Science and History Rendering of the new Building\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Rendering of the new building, designed by Legorreta + Legorreta.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Known for his use of strictly geometric, clean forms, unexpected nooks, and bright, splashy colors &mdash; although, for my money, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.barragan-foundation.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Luis Barragan<\/a> did it much better, but that&#8217;s another post in another blog &mdash; the Legorreta design for the FWMSH served as the foundation for its new identity designed by Pentagram partner DJ Stout.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fort_worth_museum_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"Forth Worth Museum of Science and History Logo, Detail\" \/><\/p>\n<blockquote>Stout and his team in Austin developed a logo consisting of three squares representing the letters F, W, and M (Fort Worth Museum) and an entire alphabet of Legorreta-inspired letterforms. The square letterforms can be stacked and rearranged like a child&#8217;s set of alphabet blocks. These symbolic &#8220;building blocks of knowledge&#8221; are a metaphor for the museum&#8217;s early roots as a children&#8217;s museum and its commitment to families and learning.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/pentagram.com\/en\/new\/2009\/05\/new-work-fort-worth-museum-of.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pentagram project detail<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p>Designing logos based on architecture is tricky and rarely that successful or, if successful, rarely distinctive or overly engaging but this is a great way of interpreting architecture without it being a literal translation of a facade or a set of columns. This new logo allows room for interpretation and a leap of imagination as to what it actually is. When I first saw the logo I immediately read &#8220;building blocks&#8221; and made the instant connection to science and play. My second thought was &#8220;Is this a Luis Barragan building I didn&#8217;t know about?&#8221;. But I digress on my Barragan fixation.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fort_worth_museum_alph.gif\" alt=\"Forth Worth Museum of Science and History Alphabet\" \/><\/p>\n<p>To complement the logo, Stout and team designed an alphabet based on the same premise as the logo, and while some of the letters hit and miss on readability it&#8217;s an interesting exercise in building scalability of the logo&#8217;s look.
