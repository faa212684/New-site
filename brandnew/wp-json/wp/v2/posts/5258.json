[&#8230;] The mission of Woke is to produce content that is authentic and uncompromised. Our business structure is designed to support honest as well as dissenting viewpoints. Woke is a nonprofit umbrella and individual shows will be for profit entities. We are assembling a board of advisers made up of leaders, public artists, and conscious media producers who will ensure the network remains true to its essence. The content of the network will include news shows, talk shows, comedy, and investigative reporting. On our platform, we also intend to feature community generated content &#8211; short topical videos that reflect our areas of focus. We will integrate emergent social technologies that facilitate coordinated action and enhance trust. The goal is to democratize media and create programming that seeks out and raises awareness of achievable solutions to our most pressing social and ecological challenges.&#8221;<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/woke_network_logo_progression.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Woke by Hello Creative\" \/>\n<figcaption>Extended logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/woke_network_stationery.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Woke by Hello Creative\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stationery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/woke_network_notepad_envelope.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Woke by Hello Creative\" \/>\n<figcaption>Notepad and envelope.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/woke_network_flyer.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Woke by Hello Creative\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/woke_network_faux_cover.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Woke by Hello Creative\" \/>\n<figcaption>Some kind of somethings.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"(Est. 2017) &quot;As the recent election has shown, our mass media system is deeply compromised by special interests and corporations.
