One of the first things we developed was the program, that was designed at 9 by 9 inches and the print run divided in six, with each letter taking over the whole cover and paired with its pattern in the back cover.<\/p>\n<p>Each of the covers had seven hand-placed rhinestones that were painstakingly but bravely done by our volunteers on the day before the event. Pro tip: 7 rhinestones times 1,000 covers equals an inordinate amount of man- and woman-hours. When we originally planned it we figured it would take 3-4 hours, instead of the nearly 8 with almost all hands on deck. But, in the end, the programs had literal bling.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/BN_Conf_2016_Identity_Summary_Program_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2016 Brand New Conference by UnderConsideration\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/BN_Conf_2016_Identity_Summary_Program_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2016 Brand New Conference by UnderConsideration\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/BN_Conf_2016_Identity_Summary_Program_04.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2016 Brand New Conference by UnderConsideration\" \/>\n<figcaption>Hand-placed rhinestones on the covers.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>For the body of the program, we established a simple 3-by-3-inch grid and left absolutely zero white space.

The hardest part was figuring out how to cut out the badge pieces from the record. After trying numerous approaches &#8212; from a &#8220;hot knife&#8221; to a table saw &#8212; we found that the crispest way was to score the record with an X-acto blade then snapping it by hand.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/BN_Conf_2016_Identity_Summary_Badges_02.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2016 Brand New Conference by UnderConsideration\" \/>\n<figcaption>Each vinyl record yields four badges and by designing around the printed label on each disk we were able to minimize the amount of cuts needed.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Once we figured out the math, the artwork was silkscreened on the record, with big, fat crop marks so that we could then score, snap, and drill the hole for the lanyard. Here is a little medley of that process.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/185532335?color=7d7d7d&#038;title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>It&#8217;s no Wes Anderson montage but it gives you an idea of the steps needed to score and snap 300 records then drill 1,100 badges.

The finished badges had a great, rigid structure and a very off-beat texture from the ridges of the records.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/BN_Conf_2016_Identity_Summary_Badges_04.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2016 Brand New Conference by UnderConsideration\" \/>\n<figcaption>The badges&#8217; texture up close and personal.

Going back to the idea of woodtype we thought it would be cool to make our type, you know, out of wood. We CNC-routered 4-foot-high letters out of birch, painted them black, transferred the designs to the letters using chalk, and hand-painted each one. We could have easily printed out the designs as large banners, trimmed them, and glued them to the letters but that&#8217;s the easy way out and whether what we do is great design or not one thing we never skimp on is effort.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/BN_Conf_2016_Identity_Summary_Letters_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2016 Brand New Conference by UnderConsideration\" \/>\n<figcaption>Some of the process.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/185539467?color=7d7d7d&#038;title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>One of the reasons why we hand-painted these. You can&#8217;t get gooeyness like this from a plotter.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>In terms of rhinestones so far, we had used white dots in the logo and a few actual rhinestones for the program so for the stage letters we wanted to convey the glittery goodness of rhinestones, as if a singer were stepping unto a dark stage. We drilled some holes in the letters &#8212; 90 per letter to be exact &#8212; and placed white christmas lights in them that were set to &#8220;pulse&#8221; so they had a very subtle fade-in, fade-out effect on the stage and they were all on different timers so it came out nicely random.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/185539063?color=7d7d7d&#038;title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>First test of lights in the office.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/BN_Conf_2016_Identity_Summary_Letters_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2016 Brand New Conference by UnderConsideration\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/BN_Conf_2016_Identity_Summary_Letters_04.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2016 Brand New Conference by UnderConsideration\" \/>\n<figcaption>A couple of pictures that capture the letters &#8220;glittering&#8221;.

Every year we question why we spend so much time, energy, and emotional investment in the conference and its materials but the appreciation of it during those two days makes it worth it and continues to help us distinguish our conference from others &#8212; it&#8217;s not perfect, or it might not be the best, or the most attended, but you can bet it&#8217;s made with tender loving care and lots of sweat and a healthy dose of tears.
