Sent in by a brand tipster &mdash; have I told you all already how much I <em>love<\/em> the tips? If not, well, let me be thankful for that this Thanksgiving &mdash; this is an almost impercebtible before\/after of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.comcast.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Comcast<\/a> logo. It is not uncommon to have logos redrawn for performance and legibility issues, but I am not convinced Comcast needed this treatment. Sure, the old &#8220;t&#8221; was ghastly, but still understandable, and I think I may like the old &#8220;s&#8221; better, although it looks like a transplant from Helvetica into Avenir, approximately typeguessing, as all the characters (old and new) feel customized.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/comcast_overlay.gif\" alt=\"Comcast Details\" \/> <\/p>\n<p>Above you can see an overlay of the old and new, with the old logo at 100% opacity and the new one at 50%, where you can tell where some of the detailing went. This exercise reminded me a little bit of Matthew Carter&#8217;s redrawing of the MoMA logo four years ago&hellip; Except, well, this one wasn&#8217;t done by Matthew Carter.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/moma_newsclip.jpg\" alt=\"New York Times Article on MoMA\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong> You can see a bigger view of the article <a href=\"http:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/random\/nyt-moma-article.gif\">here<\/a>, and read the story (and discussion!) <a href=\"http:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/speakup\/archives\/001608.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a>.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,78,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/561"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=561"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/561\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=561"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=561"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=561"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
