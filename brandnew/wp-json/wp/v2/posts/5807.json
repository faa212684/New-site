Looking to expand its client base globally, Unomaly recently introduced a new identity designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/esseninternational.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Essen International<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>As a start-up, Unomaly had invested more or less everything in the product. All resources were allocated to continuously improving the product and the sales process. Our ambition was primarily to scale Unomaly from being merely a product to a brand, preparing them for a global takeover and to make the sales process more efficient. Secondly, as they inevitably face growing pains like any other successful start-up, we had the ambition to develop an aspiring brand attracting both male and female engineers for recruiting purposes. [&hellip; The result is a] brand as unique and progressive as the product itself. A brand prepared for further expansion and internationalization. A brand worth taking note of.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/esseninternational.com\/showcase\/unomaly\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Essen International project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/unomaly_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Unomaly by Essen International\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/unomaly_logo_animation.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Unomaly by Essen International\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo animation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo was not too bad, with a slightly unorthodox typeface and making an effort to signal an anomaly by raising the &#8220;U&#8221; and underlining it. The logo could have stayed like that for years and it would have been perfectly fine. The new logo, though, speaks much more directly to the back-end, internal, terminal-like level where the work of the software takes place. The coarse bitmap wordmark looks like a font you would find in the inner workings of computer code. The result is a slightly quirky but also somehow dead-serious logo with a great rhythm to it and very interesting character shapes. The &#8220;y&#8221; is particularly engaging and, being at the end, it almost looks like an underscore blinking cursor.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/unomaly_Numerals.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Unomaly by Essen International\" \/>\n<figcaption>Numerals.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/unomaly_Lanyards.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Unomaly by Essen International\" \/>\n<figcaption>Lanyards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/unomaly_shirt.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Unomaly by Essen International\" \/>\n<figcaption>T-shirt.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/unomaly_UI.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Unomaly by Essen International\" \/>\n<figcaption>UI elements.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/unomaly_web_presence.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Unomaly by Essen International\" \/>\n<figcaption>Online presence.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">I wish there were a few more applications to see the identity in action, especially those numerals (which you can see in the image directly above). The dots with the color trailing behind them isn&#8217;t the most novel of graphic approaches but it feels appropriate to the product when combined with the color palette of dark gray, mint, blue, and purple. Overall, the logo does a great job in playing off of the name &#8212; and creating a slightly anomalous logo &#8212; but the identity, while serviceable, could do with some glitches of its own to make it more engaging.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 2010, Unomaly is a provider of IT breach-detection tools based in Stockholm, Sweden, who have developed an algorithmic software platform that monitors all data logs produced in an organization&apos;s IT-systems and, based on machine learning, it can automatically&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,26,88],"tags":[599,1042,620,868],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5807"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=5807"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5807\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=5807"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=5807"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=5807"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
