Produced by <a href=\"https:\/\/gpl.ua\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GPL<\/a>, a company that operates in the production, distribution, and sale of oils, industrial fluids, and auto parts for cars and trucks, Mitka, which means &#8220;mark&#8221; in Ukrainian, is primarily meant for use in the construction and automotive industries and is available in four application variations &#8212; universal enamel, automobile enamel, varnish colorless, and primer anticorrosive &#8212; and in more than 300 colors. The identity and packaging for Mitka have been designed by Kyiv, Ukraine-based <a href=\"https:\/\/madcats.agency\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MadCats<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>If you look at the shelf with spray-paint in a Ukrainian store, you feel sad and amused at the same time. Sad because someone made it, but amusing because someone took it and put it into production. The riot of color here goes hand in hand with strange names and tasteless typography.<br \/><br \/>In the beginning, we decided that our paint should be different.<br \/><br \/>As a child we liked to walk on fresh cement, write &#8220;Here was %username%&#8221;, or draw something on the garage facade.<br \/><br \/>Insight from childhood &#8220;Leave a Trace in History&#8221; was interpreted in our own way: Mitka means &#8220;mark&#8221; in Ukrainian and with it you can leave your spot anywhere (of course, in the aisles of Ukrainian legislation).<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/madcats.agency\/en\/mitka\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MadCats project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/\/mitka_competition.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Mitka by MadCats\" \/>\n<figcaption>The competition.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The logo is, in fact, a cylinder of paint. We joke that we drew a cylinder of letters without drawing a cylinder.<br \/><br \/>The shape here is responsible for making it easy to find Mitka on the shelf, and the color accent is for making it easy to choose the right color.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/madcats.agency\/en\/mitka\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MadCats project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/\/mitka_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Mitka by MadCats\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mitka_can_and_logo.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Can and logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>As a writer dedicated to extracting, interpreting, and rationalizing the meaning, concept, and intention behind logos &#8212; sometimes successfully, sometimes not &#8212; it is a pleasure when a logo comes along that needs no extraction, interpretation, or rationalization: this logo is a can of spray paint that physically fits on the can of spray paint it is meant to identify on the shelves. Done. It&#8217;s thick, it&#8217;s bold, there is nothing more to it, and I love it for it. The logo is certainly more effective when presented vertically as the square at the top instantly hints at the nozzle of the can and while this is the primary application as the can sits on shelves, I wish their website would have implemented it in that orientation which would have further differentiated the brand.<\/p>\n<p>(Also, I am very much appreciating the honest and direct quotes from MadCats. No BS. Lots of humor.)<\/p>\n<blockquote>On the one hand, we wanted to emphasise the practicality and utility of Mitka so that the design would literally say: &#8220;I&#8217;m just a paint. I&#8217;m not talking about Impressionism or Salvador Dali. With me, you can paint the fence, fridge and hilt of your favourite katana. Nothing else, but I can do it perfectly. I&#8217;m a paint, not an android.&#8221; Armed with this brief, we created an expressive identity and package design, while, fulfilling the dream of all brand managers: &#8220;Make the logo BIGGER&#8221;.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/madcats.agency\/en\/mitka\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MadCats project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/\/mitka_packaging_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Mitka by MadCats\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/\/mitka_packaging_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Mitka by MadCats\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/\/mitka_packaging_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Mitka by MadCats\" \/>\n<figcaption>Cans.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>There is not much science to the cans which, again, is very refreshing. It&#8217;s simply the logo as big as it will fit in the different can sizes, in the color of the paint, and, boom, it&#8217;s done. I&#8217;m assuming the white text that runs along it specifies one of the four product lines. Even the information on the &#8220;back&#8221; looks cool.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/\/mitka_packaging_04.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Mitka by MadCats\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/\/mitka_packaging_04_in_box.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Mitka by MadCats\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mitka_can_rotating_and_concrete.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Cans on other surfaces and containment objects.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\" style=\"padding-bottom: 67.25%;\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mitka_can_and_glasses.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Can and glasses.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/\/mitka_packaging_orange_sheet.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Mitka by MadCats\" \/>\n<figcaption>Some kind of promo thing.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/\/mitka_bag_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Mitka by MadCats\" \/>\n<figcaption>Bag.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/\/mitka_boxes_tape_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Mitka by MadCats\" \/>\n<figcaption>Boxes and tape.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">Overall, there is probably no need to re-emphasize how much I like this but, even beyond that superficial appreciation, this is a great presentation for the product; it may lack the car graphics the competition uses to make it clear what the product is for but I think this communicates something more important: Mitka will cover the shit out of any surface. While I&#8217;m usually rhapsodizing about how cool designs make me want to eat a burger or drink a beer at 6:00am when I write these things, right now all I want to do is shake one of them cans.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Launched this year, Mitka is a new brand of aerosol spray paint available in Ukraine.
