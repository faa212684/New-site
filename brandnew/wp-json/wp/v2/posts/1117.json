For the record though, neither spin-off sport can actually use the word Frisbee, as it is a brand name and registered trademark of Wham-o Inc., think Kleenex vis a vis facial tissues, so instead they have to use the word Disc or Flying Disc. But I digress before the gressing gets too out of hand. The subject at hand concerns the newly named <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usaultimate.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">USA Ultimate<\/a>, formerly known as the Ultimate Players Association, originally established in 1979. USA Ultimate acts as &#8220;the National Governing Body for the Sport of Ultimate.&#8221; The sport of Ultimate if you are not familiar, involves teams of seven, who score by passing the disc from one end zone to another, much like football, but when the a player has the disc he or she can only pivot before throwing it. It sounds like something you do after a few beers, but it&#8217;s actually a sport taken very seriously. Just check any of the videos <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usaultimate.org\/multimedia\/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a> to get a sense.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/usa_ultimate_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"USA Ultimate Logo, Before and After\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As it pertains to flying discs I think it&#8217;s inevitable to find swooshes, much like you find thick crosses in healthcare logos, so you have to adjust your expectations accordingly. Even by this swoosh standard, the new logo is remarkable restrained with only one overarching swoosh that houses the stars and stripes of the USA flag, just in case the word USA didn&#8217;t clearly indicate this was a USA organization. The disc in the logo looks dull and more like a really flat pill. The typography is a watered-down version of most sports typography with some pointy points and being italicized. That final &#8220;E&#8221; is simply hilarious&hellip; you don&#8217;t have to put pointy points on <em>everything<\/em>!<\/p>\n<p>The new logo is an improvement in the sense that it looks more marketable, like something you would have on a t-shirt, but <em>ultimate<\/em>ly the logo is quite disappointing.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to Doug Heimburger for first tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_100609_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_100609_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_100609_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_100609_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,26,87],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1117"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1117"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1117\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1117"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1117"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1117"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
