Two reinventions later, the channel dropped the meaning of its acronym, going solely with <a href=\"http:\/\/gnt.globo.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GNT<\/a> and changing its scope to cater to a female audience since 2003, showing original programming as well as American imports like <em>The Oprah Winfrey Show<\/em>, <em>Weeds<\/em>, <em>Nigella<\/em>, and <em>Late Show with David Letterman<\/em>. Back in March &mdash; sorry for the delay &mdash; GNT revised its logo and introduced a new on-air identity designed in-house.<\/p><!--more--><p>Images and videos sourced from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ideafixa.com\/gnt-nova-marca\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">IdeaFixa<\/a>, who has the full story (in Portuguese).

Blueish is old. Redish is new.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/gnt_colors.png\" alt=\"GNT\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The equivalent of a full moon, the old logo featured a fool swoosh, creating the appearance of a complete circle. So a big thank you, first and foremost, to the in-house team for removing it and to the corporate officers for allowing it. Since the channel has been through a few transformations it was probably a good idea to keep the old wordmark to make sure current viewers didn&#8217;t think another big change was coming. I don&#8217;t have any strong feelings against or in favor of the wordmark, it&#8217;s not bad but it&#8217;s not great. The new version certainly improves it with better proportion and a less extreme contrast between thicks and thins, which I&#8217;m sure were getting lost on TV when the logo went smaller.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/gnt_type.png\" alt=\"GNT\" \/><\/p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/21414178?portrait=0\" width=\"574\" height=\"323\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">On-air evolution from old logo to new logo and animation.<\/p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/21381136?portrait=0\" width=\"574\" height=\"323\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Reel of on-air look.<\/p>\n<p>The on-air look is pretty great. There are a couple of things I really enjoy: the way the logo moves, bounces, and blurs along with the live-action footage, perhaps cheesy at times, but playful for the most part; and the springy, blurry rectangle that frames the information, providing a very dynamic layering of color and textures. Overall this is a great redesign that seems to fit the programming and audience perfectly.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/gnt_print_sample.jpg\" alt=\"GNT\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Instructions for print applications.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to Lu&atilde; Le&atilde;o for the tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_110722_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_110722_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_110722_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_110722_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,66,26],"tags":[287,108,290,42,189],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1556"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1556"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1556\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1556"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1556"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1556"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
