It&#8217;s maybe one too many elements but they are all so soft in tone and presence that it&#8217;s not overwhelming. The logo&#8230; I like it okay but I mostly appreciate its play with counterspace with the face being a drop of cream. The wordmark is also okay and works well to immediately convey cosmetics. I would rub that.<span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/47840477\/Evreka\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Next festival 2016 by Chmela<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_next2016festival.gif\" alt=\"Next festival 2016 by Chmela\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/2016.nextfestival.sk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Next Festival<\/a> is a music and sound art festival in Bratislava, Slovakia, with an experimental outlook and representing everything from classical to electronic music. 2016&#8217;s identity, designed by Macov, Slovakia-based <a href=\"http:\/\/chmelastudio.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Chmela<\/a> features a brutalist-looking &#8220;NEXT&#8221; wordmark that starts ugly and gets uglier in use or as you roll your mouse over on the festival&#8217;s site. I know this isn&#8217;t going to be the most popular Friday Likes selection ever but I really dig the don&#8217;t-give-a-fuck-ness of it. I particularly like how &#8220;NEXT&#8221; is done all in a single, continuous line and how the disruption then blows up all the vector points in every direction but always keeping the continuous line intact. In application, I think they could have used slightly less distorted versions of the logo so that, for those willing to, there would be a readable &#8220;NEXT&#8221;. If you need me, I&#8217;ll be mousing over the logo for the next hour or so. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/chmelastudio.com\/work\/next-2016\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Well Coffee by Bond<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_wellcoffee.jpg\" alt=\"Well Coffee by Bond\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/wellcoffee.fi\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Well Coffee<\/a> is a new coffee shop in Helsinki with the distinction that it&#8217;s vegetarian. The new identity designed by local firm <a href=\"https:\/\/bond-agency.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bond<\/a> revolves around a custom typeface with little waves at its feet. Why little waves at its feet? I really don&#8217;t know, but it&#8217;s somehow totally appropriate for a vegetarian coffee shop in Helsinki. The type looks crisp and friendly and pairs great with the polka dot pattern, which itself works great as a shading texture for the charming illustrations. The brown, light blue, and white color palette give everything a nice freshness and is perfectly in tune with the physical space itself. Well, then. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/bond-agency.com\/project\/well-coffee\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"A fairly wide variety of styles and clients this week, with work from Guadalajara, Macov, and Helsinki&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[51,63,11,85,26],"tags":[1216,597,1374,906],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5278"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=5278"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5278\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=5278"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=5278"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=5278"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
