This past March, Water for People introduced a new logo designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.duffy.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Duffy &amp; Partners<\/a>.<!--more--><blockquote>Using the concept of falling water, the logo Duffy &amp; Partners created represents Water for People&#8217;s new tag line, &#8220;The Current of Change,&#8221; in a way that is not only pleasing to the eye but is full of meaning. &mdash; Press release materials<\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/water_for_people_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"Water for People\" \/><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s kind of funny, with as many things as I find at fault with the old logo &mdash; why so distressed? Why uppercase &#8220;F&#8221; in &#8220;For&#8221;? Wy is the left forearm shiny? &mdash; it is immediately understandable what they do and where they do it. It has a scrappy, get-your-hands-dirty attitude that paints a picture of the organization&#8217;s purpose and approach. In contrast, the new one feels too slick and ambiguous. Sure, I see &#8220;people&#8221; and I can read it as coming together, but the sense of water and resourcefulness is gone. The asymmetry is kind of strange, it&#8217;s not different enough to be noticeable and by making the bottom &#8220;reflection&#8221; longer, it creates a very tall logo. The typography is simple &mdash; I believe it&#8217;s a combination of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.houseind.com\/fonts\/chalet\/viewfonts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">various styles of Chalet<\/a> &mdash; and it could be overlooked easily but the &#8220;w&#8221; stands out more than it needs with its custom curves and the fact that it is, or at least it looks, lighter than the rest of the letters.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/water_for_people_card.jpg\" alt=\"Water for People\" \/><\/p>\n<p>While I am sure the new logo will play better with big donors and the media, it feels like there is a little more style than substance.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/water_for_people_bottle.jpg\" alt=\"Water for People\" \/><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_100426_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_100426_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_100426_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_100426_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,79,26],"tags":[123,105,124,42],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1085"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1085"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1085\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1085"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1085"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1085"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
