Its literally vibrant identity, designed by Gda\u0144sk, Poland-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/lesstudio\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">less.<\/a>, features a striped packaging system that comes in two flavors: 1) diagonal and colorful and 2) straight and black-and-white. While in principle there is nothing innovative about this, the density and thickness of the lines is somehow just right, as well as the blue and magenta combo of the colorful versions. The boxes are accented with a white label that has a pretty and generously spaced-out serif wordmark with a cacao icon to complete the logo. In a way, yes, I&#8217;ll be the first to point out that it&#8217;s a kind of Anagrama-lite project but it&#8217;s still a sweet system to look at. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/46365659\/Deker-rebranding\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a> <\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Zonzo Estate by Swear Words<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_zonzo.jpg\" alt=\"Zonzo Estate by Swear Words\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/zonzo.com.au\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Zonzo Estate<\/a> is a restaurant, winery, and wedding venue in the winery-friendly Yarra Valley near Melbourne in Victoria, Australia. The place looks stunning and the weddings <a href=\"https:\/\/zonzo.com.au\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">rustically decadent<\/a>. While the identity for Zonzo could be a throwaway, simple thing, Melbourne-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.swearwords.com.au\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Swear Words<\/a> has designed a slightly off-kilter, unexpectedly cool identity. The ZONZO wordmark is a dancing set of extruded letters that can take on a number of guises&#8230; from copper foiled on the business cards to embossed on the wine bottle to a step-and-repeat pattern to being on the side of a hot air balloon. It matches beautifully with the elegant eccentricity of the venue. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.swearwords.com.au\/work\/zonzo\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">DRAP agency by Mireldy\/\/design<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_drapagency.jpg\" alt=\"DRAP agency by Mireldy\/\/design\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.drap.agency\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DRAP agency<\/a> is a creative and technology agency in Zagreb, Croatia. Its new identity by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/mireldy.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mireldy\/\/design<\/a> has a groovy new wordmark that&#8217;s cool and all but not the main reason I enjoyed this project. It&#8217;s the business cards that caught my attention. At first I thought it was a Photoshop mock-up &#8212; since half of the coolest-looking projects on Behance are renders of things never made &#8212; because I couldn&#8217;t conceive of any printer hitting that trim properly with the &#8220;D&#8221;s right at the edge. I Zapruder-ed <a href=\"https:\/\/mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net\/project_modules\/1400\/e4edb747770539.5884c3d60f3d1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this image<\/a> for a while and noticed the irregularities of the edges in the stacked business cards and not even the best LiveSurface PSD file can fake irregularities like that. Then, at the bottom, it said that Cerovski printed it, so I knew it was real because they are the boss-est printers in Croatia. So this wins for me in terms of production mostly but I also appreciate the design idea and execution behind it: The &#8220;D&#8221;s are meant to be customized for each individual and it&#8217;s cool how many different variations they were able to muster. It&#8217;s also a nice application of the thick-line Dribbble style that here makes sense for a digital company and looks cohesive from logo to business card to wall decal. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/47770539\/DRAPagency-Branding\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Two vibrantly colored projects book-end a rustic one, with work from Gda\u0144sk, Melbourne, and Zagreb&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[882,1335,1133],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5156"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=5156"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5156\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=5156"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=5156"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=5156"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
