Launched on March 18, 2010, Public Mobile was one of several new Canadian cellphone providers that started in 2009-10 after a federal government initiative to encourage competition in the wireless sector. Public Mobile was acquired by Telus in October 2013. As of August 8, 2014, Public Mobile operates as a mobile virtual network operator on the Telus Mobility network. On August 31, 2015, Public Mobile &#8220;relaunched&#8221; to the public under a beta program providing free SIM cards and three tiers of BYOD plans starting with a 10-day, 30-day or a 90-day period, all of which have respective options of Talk, Text and Data. The service is not charged by minute, as with other prepaid providers. Instead, customers select which types of unlimited talk and text service and which data caps they would like for a 10-, 30-, or 90-day period.&#8221;<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/public_mobile_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Campaign for Public Mobile by Cossette\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/public_mobile_logo_variations_a.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Campaign for Public Mobile by Cossette\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo variations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/public_mobile_ads_01_b.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Campaign for Public Mobile by Cossette\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/public_mobile_ads_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Campaign for Public Mobile by Cossette\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/public_mobile_ads_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Campaign for Public Mobile by Cossette\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/public_mobile_ads_04.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Campaign for Public Mobile by Cossette\" \/>\n<figcaption>Various ads.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/wnUhtSZSVhk\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Spots.
