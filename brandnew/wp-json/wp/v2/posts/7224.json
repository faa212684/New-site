The identity, designed by Los Angeles, CA-based <a href=\"https:\/\/katiforner.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kati Forner Design<\/a>, revolves around a lovely high-contrast sans serif that&#8217;s used in the logo and a secondary treatment that displaces the letters more freely. The &#8220;ORI&#8211;&#8221; &#8220;&#8211;GIN&#8221; logo creates a great tension in its layout and looks particularly good as a pattern. The boxes, with the looser arrangement of letters, also look great with the more abstract typographic composition. The color is hard to define&#8230; copper salmon? Who knows. It&#8217;s weird. But I very much dig it. The subtle use of the square grid pattern adds a fun touch in unexpected ways like tape and vellum overlays. The bonus &#8220;OG&#8221; monogram is sweet too. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/72739275\/Origin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">The Ramble by Mast<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_ramble.jpg\" alt=\"The Ramble by Mast\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theramblehotel.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Ramble<\/a> is a 50-room boutique hotel in Denver, CO, that takes its inspiration from Madame Rambouillet&#8217;s French Salons of the 17th century. The identity, designed by local firm <a href=\"https:\/\/studiomast.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mast<\/a>, makes use of various references to Paris: the logo is inspired by ornate Parisian store-front signage; the icon is an abstraction of seeing the Louvre&#8217;s pyramid through the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel; and the supporting font is Signal, which is based on Paris&#8217; street signs. On paper this could all look like a French-heavy gimmick but all the elements are very nicely balanced in a contemporary approach with subtlety and a great attention to detail. The wordmark and custom font (designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.badsonstudio.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Badson<\/a>) are my favorite part of the project and I love how they have used both elements sparingly. Would definitely want to stay here based on the identity alone. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/studiomast.co\/projects\/the-ramble-hotel\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Rainier Roofing by Old Friend<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_rainierroofing.jpg\" alt=\"Rainier Roofing by Old Friend\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.rainierroofingcompany.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rainier Roofing<\/a>, as its name implies, is a roofing specialist company based in Lynnwood, WA, near Seattle. The identity, designed by Portland, OR-based <a href=\"https:\/\/oldfriend.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Old Friend<\/a>, is the best identity you will probably ever see for a roofing company. Even if they made their roofs out of bubble wrap I would hire them, no questions asked. (Yes, I&#8217;m exaggerating&#8230; I would haggle on price obvs.) Kidding aside, this is a fun, expressive, detailed identity that establishes Rainier Roofing as a craft-focused company &#8212; you get the sense they will care about their work and do it with focus and commitment. I love the &#8220;R \/ R&#8221; graphic with the ladder but all the other graphic doo-dads make for a great set of ingredients &#8212; as does the dog. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/oldfriend.co\/rainierroofing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"A classy range of projects this week, with work from Los Angeles, Denver, and Portland.
