It is the 20th-most extensive and the 28th-most populous of the 50 United States. Its residents are known as Oklahomans (or colloquially, &#8220;Okies&#8221;), and its capital and largest city is Oklahoma City. The state&#8217;s name is derived from the Choctaw words <em>okla<\/em> and <em>humma<\/em>, meaning &#8220;red people&#8221;. It is also known informally by its nickname, &#8220;The Sooner State&#8221;, in reference to the non-Native settlers who staked their claims on land before the official opening date of lands in the western Oklahoma Territory or before the Indian Appropriations Act of 1889, which increased European-American settlement in the eastern Indian Territory. Oklahoma Territory and Indian Territory were merged into the State of Oklahoma when it became the 46th state to enter the union on November 16, 1907. A major producer of natural gas, oil, and agricultural products, Oklahoma relies on an economic base of aviation, energy, telecommunications, and biotechnology. Both Oklahoma City and Tulsa serve as Oklahoma&#8217;s primary economic anchors, with nearly two-thirds of Oklahomans living within their metropolitan statistical areas.&#8221; (<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Oklahoma\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wikipedia<\/a>)<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/oklahoma_logo_before_after.png\" alt=\"New Logo for the State of Oklahoma\" \/>\n<figcaption>Comparison with the OK.gov identity, which I don&#8217;t believe was a formal logo for the state but was previously used on the website and has now been replaced by the new logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/oklahoma_logo_a.png\" alt=\"New Logo for the State of Oklahoma\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/oklahoma_logo_stacked_and_black_white.png\" alt=\"New Logo for the State of Oklahoma\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stacked version in full color and single-color.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/oklahoma_logo_color_variations.png\" alt=\"New Logo for the State of Oklahoma\" \/>\n<figcaption>Color variations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/OuK1c5Yvo9M\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Brand video.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/qdFfvx7xw7Q\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>The Oklahoman coverage of the logo announcement.
