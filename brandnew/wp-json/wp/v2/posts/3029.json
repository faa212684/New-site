(No word on what&#8217;s going on at their domain but there sure ain&#8217;t no insignias, pastel colors, or foils going on in it at the moment &mdash; but regardless&hellip;). Fueled by great print production the otherwise simple layouts are transformed into a stunning identity. <a href=\"http:\/\/sociodesign.co.uk\/soap\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Fresa&#8217;s by Arts and Recreation<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_fresas.jpg\" alt=\"Fresa's by Arts and Recreation\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">Although I have eaten at <a href=\"http:\/\/fresaschicken.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fresa&#8217;s<\/a> (delicious) and driven past it (hundreds of times) I only recently (Wednesday) found out who designed it (Austin, TX-based <a href=\"http:\/\/arts-rec.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Arts and Recreation<\/a>). All parentheses aside, what makes this identity great is the physical application of it, with actual paint on the walls and windows. Arts and Rec also gets right a lot of the unsophisticated vernacular of Mexican design just like Fresa&#8217;s gets what a <em>torta<\/em> is. <a href=\"http:\/\/arts-rec.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Easy-Code by Tatalab<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_easycode.jpg\" alt=\"Easy-Code by Tatalab\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">I have a confesion to make: I have no idea what&#8217;s going on in the above, what it means, or what it&#8217;s meant to represent but goddangit I like it, I like to look at it, and I like liking it.

I can&#8217;t justify their existence anyway other than they look cool. The rest of the PHP-style typography is fine and we&#8217;ve seen the HTML structure used before so that part is okay. I just like me the colored gewgaws. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/-Easy-Code_\/11816099\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Plenty of soft color palettes today with work from London, Austin, and Madrid&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[564,691,728],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3029"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3029"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3029\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3029"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3029"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3029"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
