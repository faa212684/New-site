Both of these shows were produced by her own company, Bankable. To cement her business savvy (and gain some additional attention), Banks has enrolled in the Harvard Business School&#8217;s Executive Education Owner\/President Management Program (OPM) which has her attending (and sleeping at) Harvard for one three-week period for the next three years. Her latest venture, in partnership with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.demandmedia.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Demand Media<\/a>, is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.typef.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">typeF<\/a>, &#8220;a revolutionary fashion and beauty website that listens to what women want and gives them the answers they are looking for, when and where they want it.&#8221; Banks rang the bell of at the New York Stock Exchange this past Tuesday and launched typeF.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>In the modeling business, I definitely was a type.  That&#8217;s how the business works (I am happy that my type just happened to be one with curves where most had none!). But now, I strive to break my stereotype, everyday.  I hope I can empower women to break theirs. When anyone tells you what &#8220;type&#8221; of person they think you are, it is personal.  Let&#8217;s decide our own type no matter how fierce, fabulous, fun or feisty it may be.<br \/><br \/>My type is limitless.<br \/><br \/>My type is typeF.com.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.typef.com\/tyra\/blog-type-woman\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">An explanation of what typeF stands for<\/a>, I think<\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/type_f_logo_detail.jpg\" alt=\"Type F\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/type_f_1color.jpg\" alt=\"Type F\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">1-color version.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/type_f_wall_street_01.jpg\" alt=\"Type F\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Tyra and Type F take over Wall Street, March 15, 2011.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/type_f_wall_street_02.jpg\" alt=\"Type F\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/type_f_wall_street_03.jpg\" alt=\"Type F\" \/><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not everyday that we cover logos for websites here on Brand New but this is relatively high profile and, more surprisingly, the identity is, well, surprisingly interesting. As some kind of superfluid lipstick or superstrong make-up, the &#8220;F&#8221; is highly hypnotic. I just love looking at it. I want to grab it and play with it as if it were high-fashion Silly Putty that I could also wear as an ascot. Sure, it&#8217;s all about the dimension and gradients and it&#8217;s more illustration than &#8220;logo&#8221; but it&#8217;s absolutely perfect for the medium, the audience, and the host. Seeing the 1-color application also demonstrates that someone is paying attention on the design of this identity, and it may not be your favorite style or get your fierce spirit revving but it&#8217;s hard to deny that this is all very good and well thought out. The type for &#8220;type&#8221; could be a little bolder or bigger so that it doesn&#8217;t get so lost against the &#8220;F&#8221; but it manages to not get lost. This is all about F, but it certainly gets an A from me.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks Mitch for the tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_110318_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_110318_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"574\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,66,26],"tags":[39,40,41,493],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1388"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1388"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1388\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1388"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1388"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1388"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
