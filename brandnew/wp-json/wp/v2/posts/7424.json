Headquartered in Oslo, Norway, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.huddly.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Huddly<\/a> specializes in developing cameras and software for video conferencing. They now have two cameras &#8212; GO and IQ &#8212; both of which feature a 150-degree wide angle view with the IQ having more AI features and embedded microphone. The biggest change since 2017 and part of what spurred a redesign was that their GO camera is part of the hardware kit offered by Google for its <a href=\"https:\/\/gsuite.google.com\/products\/hangouts-meet-hardware\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hangouts Meet<\/a> online conferencing product, expanding Huddly&#8217;s reach and exposure. The new identity has been designed by Oslo-based <a href=\"https:\/\/heydays.no\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Heydays<\/a>, who also designed the last identity.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>Huddly has evolved from a startup to a company to be reckoned with. We have launched our second-generation product, and our products and experiences are now sold on a global basis to industry-leading companies. We wanted our new identity to be more grown-up, focused and simplistic &#8211; without playing it too safe. We adopted a new, recognizable logo, updated our color palette and revamped how our profile is implemented across both digital and physical surfaces.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.huddly.com\/blog\/huddly-wins-award-for-design-excellence\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Huddly blog post<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/huddly_2019_logo.png\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Logo and Identity for Huddly by Heydays\" \/>\n<figcaption>Monogram.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>To connect with coworkers from all over the globe, more and more teams work remotely. This new type of teamwork is what Huddly has embraced, and with their cameras and software they&#8217;re passionate to make video calls both better and easier. This inspired Huddly&#8217;s new logo&#8211;made to look precise at any scale&#8211;it depicts a group working together at each side of the table.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/heydays.no\/project\/huddly\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Heydays project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video controls controlsList=\"nodownload\" poster=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/huddly_2019_logo_animation.png\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/huddly_2019_logo_animation.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo animation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>I liked the old logo when I first reviewed it and I still like it now but I love what they have done with the new logo to create a super minimal mark to brand their product. The icon\/monogram in the new logo at first clearly reads as an &#8220;H&#8221; and the conceptual bonus that it&#8217;s an abstracted representation for four people meeting on opposite sides of the table is a great behind-the-scenes story, even if it&#8217;s not something people get on their own. The wordmark is nice, nothing too exciting but not overly bland either and I do appreciate its neat horizontal alignment with the monogram.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/huddly_2019_logo_full.png\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Logo and Identity for Huddly by Heydays\" \/>\n<figcaption>Full logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/huddly_2019_icons.png\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Logo and Identity for Huddly by Heydays\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/huddly_2019_icon_animation.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Icons.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/huddly_2019_font.png\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Logo and Identity for Huddly by Heydays\" \/>\n<figcaption>Typography.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Not a whole lot more to say on the above other than nice icons and nice <a href=\"https:\/\/luzi-type.ch\/messina\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">font selection<\/a>.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/huddly_2019_camera_01.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Logo and Identity for Huddly by Heydays\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/huddly_2019_camera_02.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Logo and Identity for Huddly by Heydays\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/huddly_2019_camera_05.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Logo and Identity for Huddly by Heydays\" \/>\n<figcaption>The camera.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The camera is a great design of its own and the new logo looks great as a tiny detail on its lens or in the cord below.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/huddly_2019_camera_03.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Logo and Identity for Huddly by Heydays\" \/>\n<figcaption>Travel case detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/huddly_2019_camera_04.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Logo and Identity for Huddly by Heydays\" \/>\n<figcaption>Packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The GO camera packaging <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/huddly_packaging.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">was a lot more exciting<\/a> whereas this one, for the IQ, is way more barebones.

Overall, it&#8217;s a great evolution from what was already a pretty great identity. More than an evolution, perhaps, it feels like an equally successful interpretation of the same brief in an alternate universe where both identities succeed in different ways &#8212; maybe the two can video conference from these alternate universes.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"For some of you, this might sound\/look familiar as I reviewed Huddly when it launched back in 2017.
