They have been administered by the Democratic National Committee since the 1852 national convention. The primary goal of the Democratic National Convention is to nominate and confirm a candidate for president and vice president, adopt a comprehensive party platform and unify the party. Pledged delegates from all fifty U.S. states and from American dependencies and territories such as Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, and superdelegates which are unpledged delegates representing the Democratic establishment, attend the convention and cast their votes to choose the Party&#8217;s presidential candidate. Like the Republican National Convention, the Democratic National Convention marks the formal end of the primary election period and the start of the general election season.&#8221; (<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Democratic_National_Convention\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wikipedia<\/a>)<\/p>\n<p>In July, the Democratic Party will come together to formally nominate the next president and vice president candidates of the United States at the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.demconvention.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2020 Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/DNCC_2020_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2020 Democratic National Convention by Zero\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/DNCC_2020_logo_shorthand.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2020 Democratic National Convention by Zero\" \/>\n<figcaption>Shorthand.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/DNCC_2020_logo_animation.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo animation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/DNCC_2020_applications.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2020 Democratic National Convention by Zero\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sample applications.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/DNCC_2020_event.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2020 Democratic National Convention by Zero\" \/>\n<figcaption>Event (not the main event but some kind of event).<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"&quot;The Democratic National Convention (DNC) is a series of presidential nominating conventions held every four years since 1832 by the United States Democratic Party.
