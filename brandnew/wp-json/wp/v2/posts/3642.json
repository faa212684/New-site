It is a dynamic, bold word mark &mdash; specially created for UBET. The short and sharp name and logo puts the customer at the heart of the experience. We have put the &#8216;you&#8217; in betting.<br \/><br \/>&#8220;Celebrating a colloquial Australian term, the UBET name is also an active and confident affirmation that can deliver to and beyond expectations. A familiar and positive &#8216;of course&#8217; statement.

The new logo is more firmly rooted in the visual language of sports identities with a heavyweight, italic wordmark and negative space swoosh. At first glance I wasn&#8217;t too thrilled about it but there is something about it that is engaging and interesting. I don&#8217;t like how the swoosh is resolved against the &#8220;B&#8221; but it works pretty well with the &#8220;ET&#8221; part and the animation nicely establishes the source of the swoosh. As far as the name change goes, it seems like &#8220;Tatts&#8221; has a strong equity in Australia so it might seem like an odd move to throw that away but my guess is that Tatts Group wanted to give the sports and racing betting operation its own identity (literally and metaphorically) that could stand on its own and apart from all the other Tatts-related operations. Overall, a decent change within the industry and context but I wouldn&#8217;t call your bookie if you were betting on this as logo of the year.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Operated by Tatts Group, the Australian lottery\/gaming company &mdash; and a previous Reviewed subject on Brand New &mdash; TattsBet is its sports and race betting provider and one of the country&#8217;s largest, with 1,400 locations across Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania,&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,36,26],"tags":[294,562,153,42,446],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3642"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3642"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3642\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3642"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3642"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3642"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
