Well known for its eponymous hot cereal, a combination of malt flavor with farina cereal, Malt-O-Meal Company now offers more than 70 different products through ten individual brands &mdash; including Malt-O-Meal, Mom&#8217;s Best Naturals, and Three Sisters among others with cold cereal being their biggest sellers at the moment. This week Malt-O-Meal Company announced it would change its name to <a href=\"http:\/\/mombrands.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MOM Brands<\/a> and introduced a new identity designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.duffy.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Duffy &amp; Partners<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>Linda Fisher, marketing manager for the company, said it didn&#8217;t make sense for the company to go by a name that was tied to just one of its brands. She said &#8220;MOM&#8221; was how the company referred to itself internally for years.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/8301-505245_162-57381684\/malt-o-meal-changes-corporate-name-to-mom-brands\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CBS News<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe width=\"574\" height=\"292\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/rnslMPW_fnc\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Brand introduction video.<\/p>\n<p>The name change is a great move for MOM Brands, allowing the company to market each brand on its own and serving as the endorser for all of them, instead of placing emphasis on just one of the products &mdash; the oldest of the products too, which I&#8217;m sure had some antiquated perceptions attached to it. It&#8217;s a bold move to go for the &#8220;mom&#8221; name, with all the possible associations &mdash; good or bad &mdash; that consumers may make of it. But since it&#8217;s an acronym of their original name, it&#8217;s not only a clever branding move but an appropriate and smart one.<\/p>\n<p>The old corporate logo, based on the lettering of the consumer product, was pretty sad and demonstrates the problem in making the distinction between a corporate logo and brand logo when the name is the same. The new logo is adorable, friendly, and very nicely executed. The bold, chunky &#8220;m&#8221;s avoid any motherly or overly feminine clich&eacute;s and look almost like clouds around the sun. The sun itself is, well, warm, and inviting with its rosy cheeks. The &#8220;BRANDS&#8221; typography is simple and perfectly sized and spaced. Overall, a great redesign and repositioning.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bradnelson.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bradley Nelson<\/a> for the tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_120222_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_120222_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_120222_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_120222_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,36,26],"tags":[686,39,33],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1848"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1848"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1848\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1848"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1848"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1848"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
