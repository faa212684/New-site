Today it is the national carrier of the Kingdom of Bahrain serving 42 cities in 25 countries spanning three continents. It currently has a fleet of 28 aircraft but will be adding 39 more in 2018 alone. As part of this expansion, Gulf Air recently introduced a new identity designed by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.saffron-consultants.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Saffron<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/gulf_air_logo_evolution.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Livery for Gulf Air by Saffron\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo evolution.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>Gulf Air&#8217;s iconic falcon has accompanied the airline from its very beginnings and is rooted in the Middle East&#8217;s psyche. A symbol of courage, perseverance and freedom, the falcon embodies the pristine and innovative service with the emotion and raw beauty that make Gulf Air more than just an airline.<br \/><br \/>We embarked on an exploration of the anatomy and movements of falcons in their natural environment. By studying the grace and elegance of the falcon in its natural environment, we were able to truly capture the essence of this iconic bird. We then commissioned experienced illustrator <a href=\"http:\/\/www.boltgraphics.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Martijn Rivjen<\/a>, whose considered craft and understanding of natural form helped to bring this vision to life. The logo&#8217;s features run through the entire identity.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.saffron-consultants.com\/projects\/gulf-air\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Saffron project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/gulf_air_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Livery for Gulf Air by Saffron\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo wasn&#8217;t great or bad but stuck somewhere in between, with a falcon drawing that looked dynamic enough and a wordmark that was mostly bland but used some diamond shapes to make it feel ever so slightly special &#8212; its color combination was probably the worst part about it, with that blue clashing with the gold. The new logo features a much more majestic falcon drawing, soaring in the sky and drawn at an angle where it makes the viewer feel as if looking up at it (whereas the old one looked it was near the ground about to grab its prey). It&#8217;s a cool drawing with a nice interplay of light\/dark and positive\/negative. I&#8217;m not a huge fan of the line shading in the icon as I think it clashes with the more organic feel of the eagle. However, I do like the line shading in the wordmark as it gives it a slight added dimension but, as a however to this however, I also think the wordmark could have done without it. One very cool thing about the icon is that its silhouette is shaped like an airplane&#8217;s tail, which allows it to fit perfectly in the livery and once you notice it, I think it gives the falcon an extra layer of coolness.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/gulf_air_visual_language.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Livery for Gulf Air by Saffron\" \/>\n<figcaption>Visual language.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>At the heart of the new visual language is Gulf Air Sans, a distinct and ownable typeface which echoes the shape of the falcons claws, beak and wings. To add depth and texture, we also incorporated shading which evokes finer details of the feather. The typeface is designed for Arabic and latin scripts and comes in three different weights, which was achieved using the experience of type foundry <a href=\"http:\/\/letterjuice.cat\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Letterjuice<\/a>.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.saffron-consultants.com\/projects\/gulf-air\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Saffron project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/gulf_air_type_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Livery for Gulf Air by Saffron\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/gulf_air_type_detail_02.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Livery for Gulf Air by Saffron\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/gulf_air_type_detail_03.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Livery for Gulf Air by Saffron\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/gulf_air_type_detail_04.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Livery for Gulf Air by Saffron\" \/>\n<figcaption>Custom type.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The wordmark extends into a full type family that adopts the common extended structure of airline typography but adds some falcon-ness to it in the way the serifs flair ever so slightly and as an ink-trap detail. These gestures add a lot of personality to the type and yield something that feels familiar within the airline industry but establishes a distinct visual style.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/gulf_air_pattern.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Livery for Gulf Air by Saffron\" \/>\n<figcaption>Pattern.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The iconography relates back to the curves and lines of the falcon logo.
