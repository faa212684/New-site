Local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.themadeshop.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Made Shop<\/a> named the restaurant &mdash; &#8220;after a giant vault we found in the basement that used to hold the tram fares: a nickel a ride&#8221; &mdash; designed its identity and along the way also redesigned the hotel&#8217;s identity and that of its lounge and coffee shop, the Barrel Bar. The Nickel work is full of perfectly crafted, old-timey design; all paying off of the building&#8217;s early nineteenth-century history. There are some really great production details throughout the project like leather coasters, tiled grills, and silkscreened burlap bags &mdash; wouldn&#8217;t mind getting caught in this place for a few rounds. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.themadeshop.com\/192807\/6475309\/work\/the-nickel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project here<\/strong><\/a><\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Penny Royal Films by Alphabetical<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_pennyroyal.gif\" alt=\"Penny Royal Films by Alphabetical\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">In keeping with the coin-based theme, we turn to London&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pennyroyal.tv\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Penny Royal Films<\/a>, a production, animation, visual effects and direction agency for film, television and online. The logo, designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/alphabeticalstudio.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Alphabetical<\/a> is a lovely and simple &#8220;PR&#8221; monogram inside and to stay method with the penny idea, the monogram is always printed in the actual size of a penny. In copper foil, obvs. <strong><a href=\"http:\/\/alphabeticalstudio.com\/projects\/#-penny-royal-films\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">McKILROY by &amp;Larry<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_mckilroy.jpg\" alt=\"McKILROY by &amp;Larry\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">Offering menswear, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mckilroy.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">McKILROY<\/a> is a boutique shop in Perth, Australia, with an earthy (yet slightly off) identity by Singapore-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.andlarry.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">&amp;Larry<\/a>. What makes it slightly off is the logo, a &#8220;reconstructed hybrid of 8 sans-serif typefaces&#8221; &mdash; which is probably why I both hate it and love it. It&#8217;s off-putting yet interesting to look at. In application, the business cards and hangtags (and pretty much everything else) is covered in what looks like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=CHEESE+cloth&#038;es_sm=91&#038;source=lnms&#038;tbm=isch&#038;sa=X&#038;ei=Rl5DVZG5O4GdsQXxwIC4Ag&#038;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAg&#038;biw=1305&#038;bih=866#tbm=isch&#038;q=cheesecloth\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cheesecloth<\/a>, giving it a great texture and slightly kinky aesthetic. (I don&#8217;t find cheesecloth kinky, for the record, but there is something fishnet-ey about it). And we will conclude on that weird note for the weekend. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.andlarry.com\/mckilroy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"The selections this week are so money and they don&#8217;t even know it &mdash; although they most likely do &mdash; with work from Denver, London, and Singapore&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[1001,564,149],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3947"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3947"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3947\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3947"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3947"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3947"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
