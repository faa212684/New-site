AWARD is not a committee, a board or an institution. AWARD is a community. [&hellip;] AWARD is as strong, dynamic and powerful as the people who participate in it. AWARD evolves as the community that forms it evolves.<\/em> Based on the latter two principles, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.interbrand.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Interbrand Australia<\/a> created a new, living identity that reflects the evolving and dynamic nature of the organization.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/award_a.gif\" alt=\"AWARDS Logo, As\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The logo is comprised of numerous dots, each dot representing a member of the organization. The logo taps into the AWARD membership database to recreate itself whenever needed, be it online in the web site designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.deepend.com.au\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Deepend<\/a> or for print purposes. Interbrand Australia&#8217;s Creative Director, Chris Maclean, further explains:<\/p>\n<blockquote>Controlled by a complex algorithm, the dots converge, diverge, bounce and swarm &mdash; behaviour that you would expect of a creative organism. Together, the dots form the shape of an ever-morphing &#8220;A&#8221; for AWARD.<br \/><br \/>The dots come in three different sizes to represent membership levels. The smallest dots represent the students of AWARD School; the largest dots represent members who have received accolades from AWARD; and, the medium sized dots represent all other members. An individual career can therefore be tracked all the way from a student to an awarded professional.<br \/><br \/>As time goes by, the logo will evolve with the population of the membership and as each member&#8217;s career progress.<br \/>In the printed world, the logo retains its dynamic nature, appearing in a different configuration on every application. This is made possible by an online logo-generator. A unique logo is automatically and instantaneously downloaded every time new artwork goes to print.<\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/award_lockups.gif\" alt=\"AWARDS Logo, Lockups\" \/><\/p>\n<p>I am getting addicted to these living identities &mdash; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/words_periods_arial_company_na.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">like last month&#8217;s Namics<\/a> &mdash; and I wonder if there will be a day, much like the day when a cell phone without a GPS map is obsolete, that a logo that doesn&#8217;t live in real time will be obsolete. But you don&#8217;t come here for my futuristic predictions, so let&#8217;s get to the design. Static, it&#8217;s hard to discern that the &#8220;A&#8221; is made of dots and not just of rounded debris, which is not entirely bad, but I wonder if allowing a few of the dots to stray on their own would help make it clear that these are a bunch of dots, not just a distressed &#8220;A.&#8221; However, online, the logo is amazingly convincing and engaging, bringing the concept to life, and I guess that will always be the challenge of bridging the ease of portraying real time online with the hardship of translating it to print, but it&#8217;s nice to see that AWARD is taking advantage of digital printing to move this living identity concept forward.<\/p>\n<p>Without sounding like a lame criticism of the organization, it&#8217;s kind of advantageous that AWARD does not have thousands of members, because they would probably end up with an unrecognizable blob. In the end, this is a great identity for a creative organization and it&#8217;s nice to see a client that allows the boundaries of identity to be pushed a little.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,71,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/873"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=873"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/873\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=873"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=873"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=873"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
