In 1975 it established a school that is at its core of services and also offers multiple care, training and occupational services, through a team of more than 300 people to help over 1,500 people. Earlier this month, Ampans introduced a new identity designed by Barcelona-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.morillas.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Morillas<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>By mutual agreement, we established a co-creation scenario that resulted in the entire Morillas team working on 8 proposals that would later permit 30 monitors\/educators from Ampans, and 150 users to collaborate in the process.<br \/><br \/>The result was a choral activity channelled through three experimental workshops &mdash; shapes, alphabets and free expression &mdash; which brought an explosion of proposals that formed the ideal base from which to develop our graphic work.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.morillas.com\/en\/projects\/we-are-our-identity\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Morillas project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/127917056?color=f04923&#038;title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Process video. Good to watch before scrolling.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The final proposal, which delighted us all, was to orchestrate a typographic brand with a collection of interchangeable letters for each application. We had never before seen a brand that harnessed such spontaneity and creativity, or one that reflected, with such precision, the values of Ampans&#8217; daily existence.<br \/><br \/>The new identity embraces randomness and craftsmanship to transmit the richness of the proposal and the boldness that Ampans, as an institution, carries forward in its mission.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.morillas.com\/en\/projects\/we-are-our-identity\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Morillas project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ampans_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Ampans by Morillas\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ampans_logo_subbrands.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Ampans by Morillas\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sub-brands.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ampans_alphabet.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Ampans by Morillas\" \/>\n<figcaption>Part of the alphabet.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The previous logo wasn&#8217;t much to look at but as far as simplicity goes, it didn&#8217;t get any more basic. The new logo is still a fairly simple approach but loaded with great meaning and relevance. Based on a collaborative alphabet created by the students and people that Ampans helps, the logo is an ever-changing wordmark that works constantly to represent the people that benefit the most from this organization. The logo is not necessarily the most striking or balanced piece of design but it makes up for it in charm. Perhaps it would have been necessary to create a holding shape that would help make all the different combinations appear more as a unit and you can see in the sub-brands that anchoring the logos with some kind of system gives them more strength as an identity.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ampans_stationery.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Ampans by Morillas\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stationery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ampans_business_cards.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Ampans by Morillas\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ampans_brochures.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Ampans by Morillas\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brochures.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ampans_sign_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Ampans by Morillas\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ampans_sign_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Ampans by Morillas\" \/>\n<figcaption>New sign.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ampans_tshirts.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Ampans by Morillas\" \/>\n<figcaption>T-shirts.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ampans_tshirts_detail.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Ampans by Morillas\" \/>\n<figcaption>T-shirt detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">In application, the logo is treated just like a corporate identity, which is a good way to make sure this is still an identity that can operate with other organizations and individuals, from vendors to donors. The brochure covers are probably the best use, by combining photography with a white label-like container, the logo, and a nicely typeset sans serif. Perhaps a dash of color would help in the stationery (even if it looks like the backs have color) as the fronts start to feel a tad dry. Overall, this is a heart-warming identity with a great process behind it that should make people proud to use it.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1965, Ampans is an organization in Manresa, Spain, near Barcelona, whose mission is to help children and adults with learning and intellectual disabilities.
