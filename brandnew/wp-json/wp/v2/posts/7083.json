Neither Europe nor Asia, it&#8217;s a nexus of ancient historical empires, but also a &#8216;new&#8217; nation rapidly transforming itself with a super-charged gust of petro-spending. The cosmopolitan capital, Baku, rings a Unesco-listed ancient core with dazzling 21st-century architecture and sits on the oil-rich Caspian Sea. In the surrounding semi-desert are mud volcanoes and curious fire phenomena. Yet barely three hours&#8217; drive away, timeless rural villages, clad in lush orchards and backed by the soaring Great Caucasus mountains are a dramatic contrast.&#8221; This past October, the <a href=\"http:\/\/tourismboard.az\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Azerbaijan Tourism Board<\/a> introduced a new identity designed by <a href=\"https:\/\/landor.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Landor<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>We immersed ourselves in the history, the landscape, the culture, and the people. Everyday a new contradiction stopped us in our tracks and we realized this was a place we would have to look at differently. We needed to open people&#8217;s eyes to this land of revelations, where every corner hides a fresh discovery.<br \/><br \/>Our discovery led us to the brand idea &#8220;Take another look&#8221; and to our visual identity, which is an invitation to consider Azerbaijan from a new point of view. The &#8220;reveal lens&#8221; enables two contrasting views of the country to come together to expose an intriguing new perspective on the place and its culture.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/landor.com\/work\/azerbaijan\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Landor project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/azerbaijan_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo for Azerbaijan (Tourism) by Landor\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/azerbaijan_monogram_variations.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Azerbaijan (Tourism) by Landor\" \/>\n<figcaption>Monogram variations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo, well, nothing says &#8220;Welcome tourists!&#8221; like a flaring oil stack. It&#8217;s probably not fair to poke too much fun at what was clearly a logo with good intentions but lacking the necessary resources to make it appropriate or good so I will only mention one more snarky thing: someone forgot to tell the &#8220;I&#8221; in the wordmark it was casual Friday. The new logo, at first, seems kind of random when seeing the abstract &#8220;a&#8221; monogram as the color variation in the two elements makes it look like a circle with a slice of fruit on top of it. The connection of the monogram to the first letter of the wordmark isn&#8217;t immediate but it&#8217;s also not far-fetched and once you see the relationship it starts to make more sense.<\/p>\n<p>The two elements of the monogram serve as individual windows through which contrasting images can be seen and this activates the icon in a much more interesting and successful way than when it&#8217;s only in contrasting colors as there is a better synergy between the two elements as they work together to reveal structurally-similar images. The wordmark is, in principle, a geometric sans with customized curved corners that are usually annoying but there is something more pleasing than usual about the approach in this case that makes the final typography look more intentional and better resolved. They should have stopped before adding the downward serif on the &#8220;z&#8221; though.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/azerbaijan_ad_00.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Azerbaijan (Tourism) by Landor\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/azerbaijan_ad_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Azerbaijan (Tourism) by Landor\" \/>\n<figcaption>Photo activation with logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/azerbaijan_ad_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Azerbaijan (Tourism) by Landor\" \/>\n<figcaption>Ad.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The monogram works even better when used as a single shape like in the ads above in the logo-as-window treatment; its large square footage works very well in really letting another image seep through it and make a contrasting statement. I also like the combination of bold sans serif and light Italic serif in the copywriting &#8212; it&#8217;s Design 101 but it&#8217;s nicely executed.<p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/azerbaijan_promo_items.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Azerbaijan (Tourism) by Landor\" \/>\n<figcaption>Promotional products.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/azerbaijan_brochure.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Azerbaijan (Tourism) by Landor\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brochure spotted in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=d9762WR1t5k\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this video<\/a>.
