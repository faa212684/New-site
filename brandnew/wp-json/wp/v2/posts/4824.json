I don&#8217;t expect this project to get a high percentage of &#8220;Great&#8221; votes as it&#8217;s far from a classically exciting Friday Like but, as designed by New York, NY-based <a href=\"http:\/\/studionewwork.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">STUDIO NEWWORK<\/a>, the almost absurdly minimalist design is handled exceptionally well and, more importantly, it fits the product. The condensed logo works surprisingly good at any size, from XS to XXL, and holds up quite well when reproduced on fabric. This verges on the VICE\/hipster aesthetic that might have a few of you rolling your eyes &#8212; and that&#8217;s fine &#8212; but to be able to convey an attitude with minimal elements, as this does, is not an easy task. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/24208633\/Utility-Garments\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Tom&#8217;s Town Distilling Co. by Kevin Cantrell<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_tomstown.jpg\" alt=\"Tom's Town Distilling Co. by Kevin Cantrell\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.toms-town.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tom&#8217;s Town Distilling Co.<\/a> is the first legal distillery in Kansas City since Prohibition and knowingly channels the 1920s vibe and aesthetics of <em>The Great Gatsby<\/em>.

With less than fifty shades of gray, the minimal identity looks, smells, and tastes like science with a touch of <em>2001: A Space Odyssey<\/em>. The typography is impeccable and the layouts all have great tension throughout. The kicker is the glow-in-the-dark ink elegantly applied in key areas that hurdle it past mere gimmickry. The black and white renderings of planets and black holes and other weird space stuff are awesome to look at.
