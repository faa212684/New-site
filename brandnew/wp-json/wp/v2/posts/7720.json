Screening more than 200 films, SFF then selects 12 winning films representing &#8220;courageous, audacious and cutting-edge&#8221; cinema. Recently completed, the 2019 edition of the festival featured a new identity designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/forthepeople.agency\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">For the People<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sydney_film_festival_2019_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Sydney Film Festival by For the People\" \/>\n<figcaption>Primary logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sydney_film_festival_2019_logo_animation.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Sydney Film Festival by For the People\" \/>\n<figcaption>Primary logo animation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo was okay, with a sans serif featuring a glowing &#8220;D&#8221; that I&#8217;m guessing was meant to look like a bright screen inside a dark theater. The &#8220;D&#8221; was a strange letter to make the hero but it&#8217;s the only fully fillable letter in the name. The new logo is another sans serif, <a href=\"https:\/\/pangrampangram.com\/products\/agrandir\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Agrandir<\/a>, which is slightly quirky and odd &#8212; not so much in the specific characters that appear in the name but the rest of them, especially the lowercase are pretty interesting. In principle, there isn&#8217;t much to the logo so if it leaves you wanting more, there are at least 30 other logos in this identity that might satisfy you.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sydney_film_festival_2019_logo_all.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Sydney Film Festival by For the People\" \/>\n<figcaption>Secondary logos, scattered.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sydney_film_festival_2019_logo_all_neat.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Sydney Film Festival by For the People\" \/>\n<figcaption>Secondary logos, neatly aligned.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sydney_film_festival_2019_logo_all_taxonomy.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Sydney Film Festival by For the People\" \/>\n<figcaption>Secondary logos, organized by category.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sydney_film_festival_2019_logo_all_crops.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Sydney Film Festival by For the People\" \/>\n<figcaption>Secondary logos, some of them, in color blocks.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sydney_film_festival_2019_logo_all_color_palette.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Sydney Film Festival by For the People\" \/>\n<figcaption>Secondary logos, showcasing the color palette.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/339030026?title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"360\" height=\"203\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sydney_film_festival_2019_logo_reel_highlights.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Sydney Film Festival by For the People\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo reel.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Referencing 1970s to 1990s film and TV production logos with a filter of those logos being played on Betamax and VHS tapes, the identity system uses a very wide range of totally gratuitous but totally awesome logos to promote and present the festival and all of its films. I love how they categorized the logos into buckets like &#8220;screen&#8221;, &#8220;sound&#8221;, &#8220;associations&#8221;, and &#8220;miscellaneous&#8221;, capturing all the different logos you would see in the opening credits and end titles of a movie. It&#8217;s tempting to give an opinion on each logo but, honestly, y&#8217;all don&#8217;t pay me enough&#8230; kidding. The point of the logos isn&#8217;t their individual execution &#8212;\u00a0it helps that they are all pretty much on point &#8212; but the overall effect they create: a weird, micro-universe where all aspects of a movie are handled by an SFF conglomerate. The animations are fantastic with their jagged and jumpy motion as if they had been done on the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vice.com\/en_us\/article\/a3k3q8\/meet-the-engineer-preserving-the-last-analog-motion-graphics-machine\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Scanimate<\/a>.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sydney_film_festival_2019_typography.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Sydney Film Festival by For the People\" \/>\n<figcaption>Typography.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sydney_film_festival_2019_guidelines.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Sydney Film Festival by For the People\" \/>\n<figcaption>Guidelines.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sydney_film_festival_2019_business_cards.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Sydney Film Festival by For the People\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sydney_film_festival_2019_business_cards_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Sydney Film Festival by For the People\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sydney_film_festival_2019_newsprint_program_cover.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Sydney Film Festival by For the People\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sydney_film_festival_2019_newsprint_program_spreads.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Sydney Film Festival by For the People\" \/>\n<figcaption>Festival guide.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sydney_film_festival_2019_posters_various.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Sydney Film Festival by For the People\" \/>\n<figcaption>Many, many posters.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sydney_film_festival_2019_posters_more.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Sydney Film Festival by For the People\" \/>\n<figcaption>More posters.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The applications are fairly straightforward in the sense that it&#8217;s always a big logo at the top with the date, followed by type or a film frame, followed by secondary logos, followed by official sponsor logos, and done, all in a justified layout.
