Daniel Libeskind&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.culturevulture.net\/ArtandArch\/JewishMuseumBerlin.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jewish Museum<\/a>, Norman Foster&#8217;s addition to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.galinsky.com\/buildings\/reichstag\/index.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Reichstag<\/a> and Frank Gehry&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/figure-ground.com\/travel\/image.php?dz_bank\">DZ Bank<\/a> are unarguable highlights, but there is one building that, at least on my visit, stood out as one of the most intriguing: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hkw.de\/en\/index.php\">The House of World Cultures<\/a> (Haus der Kulturen der Welt). Designed in 1957 by architect Hugh Stubbin, the building&#8217;s iconic concrete roof is beautiful from afar, vertiginous up close, and surprising from any distance &mdash; delightfully offset by its massive copper-hued facade. The best way I could describe the building is as if a UFO would have landed in Stanley Kubrick&#8217;s <em>A Clockwork Orange<\/em>: Surreal, sensual, and slightly dangerous. The building has been closed to the public for more than a year and it reopens this month. To signal the new era for the institution Berlin-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.doublestandards.net\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Double Standards<\/a>  has designed a new identity: Helvetica uppercase in a box. A far cry from the idiosyncrasy of the building and an odd step backwards in the otherwise innovative visual landscape of Berlin. The previous logo, designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.typophile.com\/node\/12638\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cornel Dwindlin in the late 80s<\/a>, while he was working with Neville Brody, wasn&#8217;t extraordinarily innovative either &mdash; uppercase letters in a box &mdash; but the custom hand-drawn typography had enough peculiarities to make it feel unique to its mothering institution. Helvetica&#8217;s neutrality and ubiquity functions as the perfect vessel upon which to create meaning for any institution, but when it dismisses its unique context, Helvetica can really be a drag.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Story spotted on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.page-online.de\/page\/weblog\/redesign_des_tages\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PAGE<\/a>.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,63,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/527"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=527"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/527\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=527"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=527"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=527"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
