All in all, lots of people in a city with lots to do and lots to see. This month the S&atilde;o Paulo Turismo agency introduced a new identity designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/romulocastilho.com\/case\/sao-paulo\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Romulo Castillho<\/a> to help propel the city forward with a unified message as it enters a busy decade with the World Cup and Summer Olympic Games. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ideafixa.com\/nova-marca-turismo-sp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ideafixa<\/a> posted a detailed interview with Romulo and has a few more images.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/spturis_construction.jpg\" alt=\"S&atilde;o Paulo Tourism\" width=\"574\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/spturis_logo_detail.jpg\" alt=\"S&atilde;o Paulo Tourism\" width=\"574\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/spturis_logo_colors.jpg\" alt=\"S&atilde;o Paulo Tourism\" width=\"574\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/spturis_pillars.jpg\" alt=\"S&atilde;o Paulo Tourism\" width=\"574\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">The four pillars of the brand: Looking for the unexpected, living in the present, respecting differences, micro-communities.<\/p>\n<p>The logo is meant to represent both the diversity and variety of people and cultures in S&atilde;o Paulo as well as being a loose depiction of the metropolis with roads and avenues that converge climactically at its center. While this premise could apply to a dozen of the largest cities in the world there is something particularly&hellip; well, Brazilian, about it. I couldn&#8217;t see this working for other large cities in South America like Argentina or Colombia. It&#8217;s bold, colorful, and festive. It lacks some cultural specificity &mdash; as Peru, for example, was so well able to do &mdash; and it feels like it champions style over substance, even though it is grounded in plenty of research as the linked interview reveals.<\/p>\n<p>There is a nice connection between the wordmark and the exploding (imploding?) shapes with one corner being rounded and the others straight. (I say this acknowledging that in the past I have berated this technique, but it&#8217;s properly pulled off here). We could debate the placement and sizes of the shapes but that would be pretty useless&hellip; and thinking of it, it would have been nice if there were different configurations for a flexible identity. The typography is Gotham-ish without being overly Gotham, perhaps it&#8217;s the tilde over the &#8220;a&#8221; that takes into less common territory. My favorite aspect of the identity is the cropping and tiling of the shapes which create a lovely 1950s, Alving Lustig-esque, Happy Modernist vibe. Overall, it&#8217;s a very nicely executed identity with plenty of potential.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/spturis_stationery.jpg\" alt=\"S&atilde;o Paulo Tourism\" width=\"574\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/spturis_stuff.jpg\" alt=\"S&atilde;o Paulo Tourism\" width=\"574\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to Ricardo Pitanga for the tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_111202_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_111202_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_111202_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_111202_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_111202_config_03.xml&#038;xyz=poll_111202_votes_03.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv3\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv3\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,64,26],"tags":[146,617,42,651],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1744"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1744"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1744\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1744"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1744"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1744"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
