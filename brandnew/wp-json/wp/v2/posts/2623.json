Then, the excuse: I did not see it at the time and it is awesome now as much as in 2008. This identity and signage system designed by Dutch-bred and Hong Kong-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nivardthoes.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nivard Thoes<\/a> for the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.timesmuseum.org\/enindex.jhtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Times Museum<\/a> in Guangzhou, China is a lovely blend of Asian simplicity and Dutch edginess. The monospace and blocky typography, sometimes stenciled, along with some road-inspired patterns gives this museum a very contemporary and energetic aesthetic. (And, yes, at times it looks a bit like the Walker Art Center but that&#8217;s better than looking a bit like, I dunno, Hooters). <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nivardthoes.com\/times.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">The Clarendon Centre by FentonForeman<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_clarendoncentre.gif\" alt=\"The Clarendon Centre\"\/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px;\">If after seeing the Times Museum you are still jonesing for some monospaced typography I have exactly what you need. For <a href=\"http:\/\/www.clarendoncentre.org.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Clarendon Centre<\/a>, a conference venue in Brighton, UK, local firm  <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fentonforeman.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FentonForeman<\/a> literally spelled out what this is: The Clarendon Centre at the Heart of Brighton. Perfectly kerned (since it&#8217;s not a true monospace font), the logo is simple despite being overly wordy thanks to the light weight choice. The bright teal is a little tiring after staring at it for a while but it helps give it a minty-fresh look. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fentonforeman.com\/The-Clarendon-Centre-Rebrand\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">C.F. Rosette by Alex Varanese<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_cfrosette.jpg\" alt=\"C.F. Rosette\"\/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px;\">And now for something completely different. And not real, which is really the most disappointing thing about this project. C.F. Rosette Caffeinated Beverage Purveyors is a fictitious coffee chain imagined by San Francisco, CA-based Alex Varanese (a k a <a href=\"<a href=\"http:\/\/www.elektreaux.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Elektreaux<\/a>) with &#8220;an emphasis on lavishly detailed products&#8221; that are influenced by &#8220;the maps, currency, and other printed artifacts of 20th century Europe&#8221;. This is pure design porn and I&#8217;m loving it. It&#8217;s self-indulgent, it&#8217;s ornamental out the wazoo, and it would probably never be approved by an actual client. But, man, it&#8217;s lavish alright. What&#8217;s even more impressive (and not shown here) are the highly detailed environment illustrations Alex has created to show his packages in situ, it&#8217;s the branding equivalent of sci-fi concept art. I think Mr. Varanese could do a killing making renderings for big brand consultancies. Clients would swoon over this kind of prototyping. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.elektreaux.com\/design\/brand_cfr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"A double-feature of monospaced identities punctuated by a wacky, pie-in-the-sky ornamental coffee chain in this week&apos;s Friday Links with work from Hong Kong, Brighton, and San Francisco&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[597,540,327],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2623"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2623"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2623\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2623"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2623"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2623"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
