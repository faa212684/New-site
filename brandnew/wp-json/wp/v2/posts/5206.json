It offers Bachelor and Master degrees across Architecture and Design; Business, Cultural and Legal Studies; Civil Engineering; Computer Science; Electrical Engineering and Information Technology; and Mechanical Engineering. Late last year, HTWG introduced a new identity designed by Berlin-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thinkmoto.de\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">think moto<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>The basic idea of \u200b\u200bthe new design is the topics &#8220;center&#8221; and &#8220;networking&#8221;. With its new appearance, the HTWG presents itself as a location with international networking, optimal career prospects, excellent infrastructure in an attractive location. This basic idea is visualized by a visible grid system, in which individual points can be marked or connected.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.htwg-konstanz.de\/Details.193.0.html?&#038;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=2160&#038;cHash=c18c5b225f28f4610e6898db0c869f97\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">HTWG press release (Google-translated)<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/htwg_grid.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for HTWG by think moto\" \/>\n<figcaption>Grid concept.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/htwg_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for HTWG by think moto\" \/>\n<figcaption>Full logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/htwg_logo_sub.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for HTWG by think moto\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sample sub-brand.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo was quite daring with a relatively hard to read HTWG acronym set in some massive letters that do deserve some commendation for being different. The full name in the almost default-looking sans serif and the baby blue color wasn&#8217;t the right combination unfortunately. The new logo is much clearer, cleaner and retains the weird-ish vibe of the old one with a relatively uncommon stacking of its acronym. Set on a 3-by-3 grid &#8212; that is very loosely and questionably based on the concept of the location of the university in context of the world &#8212; the &#8220;H&#8221; for Hochschule stands on its own while the &#8220;TWG&#8221; (that makes this Hochschule different than other Hochschules) stand together. I&#8217;m surprised they left out the &#8220;K&#8221; for Konstanz not just in the new logo but in the old as well. It makes for a decent, somewhat interesting logo. The grid comes in handy for each department, with its relevant initials appearing on the right column. The full name (and the rest of the typography) is set in the dry but crowd-pleasing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.myfonts.com\/fonts\/bitstream\/swiss-721\/?refby=ucllc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Swiss 721<\/a>.<\/p>\n<blockquote>The new logo of the HTWG radiates seriousness, the further design elements allow for a high variability, which highlights the joy of innovation and sparkling creativity. In typography, design elements, use of color and the world of images, the design allows for both the dynamic aspects of the university vision as well as vision and future orientation, as well as fixed, stationary facets of the vision, such as proximity to life and credibility.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.htwg-konstanz.de\/Details.193.0.html?&#038;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=2160&#038;cHash=c18c5b225f28f4610e6898db0c869f97\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">HTWG press release (Google-translated)<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/htwg_elements.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for HTWG by think moto\" \/>\n<figcaption>Identity elements.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/6fUr4L1mEz4\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Identity system presentation.

Although there is the concept of &#8220;networking&#8221; mentioned &#8212; what university <em>isn&#8217;t<\/em> networking? &#8212; in the quote and the applications do build on that concept I would gladly accept that the application&#8217;s concept were &#8220;because it looks cool and applied-science-y&#8221; because that&#8217;s what it really does well. Like, you are not going to HTWG to be the next Shakespeare. The layouts are generally interesting and both flat colors and photos look great in the background with all the flotsam and jetsam over them.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/htwg_poster.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for HTWG by think moto\" \/>\n<figcaption>Ad.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/htwg_web.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for HTWG by think moto\" \/>\n<figcaption>Online presence.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/htwg_cake.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for HTWG by think moto\" \/>\n<figcaption>Will it cake? Like a boss!<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">Overall, not knowing much about this university, this identity helps give it a personality that&#8217;s about precision but with a looseness that speaks to the possibilities of each student making their own connections. Sorry, don&#8217;t mean to get too philosophical on their behalf. Point being: it works.
