Designed by Hong Kong-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.blow.hk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Blow<\/a>, the voluminous and wobbly soil shape gets turned into a lovely pattern that adds to the textile, handcrafted feel and the name of the company is set in a fragile uppercase serif that starts to break apart quite nicely in applications like the tote bag. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.blow.hk\/?p=1264\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">J.

Hornig<\/a>. The main reason it&#8217;s here is because of the brown and red color palette. It is <em>so<\/em> good looking. The logo is pretty straightforward but it&#8217;s deployed in just the right size with the just the right amount of whitespace that makes it shine in all the materials. The packaging extends the color palette to even prettier colors and redraws the afro-trotting gentlemen to great effect. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.moodley.at\/de\/portfolio\/branding\/j-hornig.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Checklist by Anagrama<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_checklist.jpg\" alt=\"Checklist by Anagrama\"\/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">It had been a while since we last had <a href=\"http:\/\/www.anagrama.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Anagrama<\/a> on Friday Likes and here they are with an identity for a small company in Monterrey that specializes in custom event planning for birthdays, anniversaries, corporate events, and more. Aptly called <a href=\"http:\/\/checklist.mx\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Checklist<\/a> &mdash; as in event planning it&#8217;s all about checking off items from a list &mdash; the identity adopts a regal-slash-academic aesthetic that provides a handsome, upscale vibe. The dark blue, pink, and gold color choices go so well together and if you had told me that a monospace typewriter font would pair great with a wordmark on a curve I wouldn&#8217;t believe you. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.anagrama.com\/portafolio\/150-checklist\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"A lot of exuberant simplicity in this edition of Friday Likes with work from Hong Kong, Vienna, and Monterrey&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[597,756,769],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2788"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2788"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2788\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2788"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2788"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2788"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
