Their identity, designed by local firm <a href=\"https:\/\/bangbang.ca\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bang Bang<\/a>, is a little odd to be honest, with a strange emphasis on the &#8220;A&#8221; &#8212; striked out in the logo and highlighted in the envelopes &#8212; but it has a boldness and energy that is hard to replicate. The color palette is completely unexpected with colors that don&#8217;t typically go together but the large typography makes the combinations more interesting than jarring. I do wish they had taken photos in a studio and not by the window during Summer solstice. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/bangbang.ca\/blogs\/projets\/124116739-haussmann-park\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">The Winslow by Vanderbrand<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_thewinslow.jpg\" alt=\"The Winslow by Vanderbrand\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/thewinslow.ca\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Winslow<\/a> is a luxury residential building in the upscale Lawrence Park neighborhood of Toronto, Ontario, and its identity, designed by local firm <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vanderbrand.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Vanderbrand<\/a>, easily reflects that. An elegant and thin low-contrast sans serif, in gold, accents every application, most of them in a deep green while a slick &#8220;W&#8221; monogram makes special appearances. There is really not that much going on but it&#8217;s all so finely done that all the materials feel rich. The logo on the lobby on top of what look like white dragon scales is worth the multi-thousand monthly maintenance fee that living in this building probably requires. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.vanderbrand.com\/project\/the-winslow\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Big Softee by Radical Co-operative<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_bigsoftee.jpg\" alt=\"Big Softee by Radical Co-operative\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bigsofteela.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Big Softee<\/a> is a new soft-serve ice cream shop in  Monterey Park, CA, whose owners were born in Hong Kong (hence the use of Cantonese &#8211;correct me if I&#8217;m wrong please &#8212; in the name). The identity, designed by Los Angeles, CA-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.radicalco-op.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Radical Co-operative<\/a> features a charming script wordmark with a 1950s innocent vibe and an anthropomorphized ice cream cone that steals the show in its application as a custom spoon. And as lapel pins. And as napkins. It&#8217;s kind of dumb but it&#8217;s awesome. Looking through Big Softee&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/bigsoftee\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Instagram account<\/a> it&#8217;s amazing how well this identity plays out as a jolt of fun visuals and delicious product, perfectly branded. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.radicalco-op.com\/big-softee\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"A relatively minimalist mix of projects this week, with work from Montr\u00e9al, Toronto, and Los Angeles&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[36,11,83,85,26],"tags":[781,1107,556],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7482"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=7482"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7482\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=7482"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=7482"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=7482"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
