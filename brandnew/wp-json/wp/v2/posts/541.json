The new Republican National Convention logo has pushed the immobile elephant in a less cute direction, now looking something like Babar&#8217;s evil and dumb cousin who ate wild mushrooms; it&#8217;s breaking free of the circus ring in order to bludgeon the crowd. Simplicity has been cast aside with the new agressive stripes, flailing limbs, a curly trunk, and pointy tusks. A terrifyingly patriotic and angry eye stares at the indoctrinated far right, and threatens the majority of the United States (also the world) with a circus of policies we can&#8217;t even imagine. Just like the party it symbolizes&#8211;the symbol is both unwieldy and frightening&#8211;&#8220;strong and dignified&#8221; no more.<\/p><!--more--><p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"republican_logo_detail.gif\" src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/republican_logo_detail.gif\" width=\"470\" height=\"200\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This is what the terror looks like up close, right before you get crushed.<\/p>\n<p>(note: this was written by a hippie, pinky, east-coast, big-government liberal)<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":8,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[56,12,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/541"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/8"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=541"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/541\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=541"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=541"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=541"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
