Its name comes from the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Eulachon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Eulachon<\/a>, a type of fish that, when dried and strung on a wick, can be used as a candle. After coining the name, local design firm <a href=\"http:\/\/fuzzco.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fuzzco<\/a> cobbled together a beautiful identity that starts with a double-fish icon that turns into the flame of a candle, a series of illustrations, and all kinds of fish references and interpretations, all in a warm color palette of gold, red, and cream. Smelling fishy never smelled (or looked) so good. <a href=\"http:\/\/fuzzco.com\/work\/candlefish\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project here<\/strong><\/a><\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Residency by Jules Tardy<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_residency.gif\" alt=\"Residency by Jules Tardy\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.residencycontent.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Residency<\/a> is a collective of directors and filmmakers in New York whose range of approaches is echoed by their flexible identity designed by Brooklyn, NY-based <a href=\"http:\/\/julestardy.tumblr.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jules Tardy<\/a>. There aren&#8217;t many applications to this project like other Friday Likes but I could look at that animated GIF all day long. (I admit that this is the kind of stuff I would design myself: gridded, based on a couple of simple rules, equally-spaced shit). The monospace font choice plays great in all the shapes its placed in and the red on pastel colors provides an unexpected palette. Another nice detail is the header logo on their website. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.residencycontent.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Go ahead and scroll it<\/a>. Clever way of bringing the flexible identity to life online. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/14852753\/Residency-Identity-Website-Design\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project here<\/strong><\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Jason O. Stevens by Ryan Romanes<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_jos.jpg\" alt=\"Jason O. Stevens by Ryan Romanes\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">Based in Boston, MA, <a href=\"http:\/\/jasonostevens.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jason O. Stevens<\/a> is a brand and project manager with a cool acronym, JOS. (I don&#8217;t know why it&#8217;s cool&hellip; maybe because it sounds like Jaws, and someone nicknamed Jaws is someone I would want on my team. But I&#8217;m projecting, so I digress). The problem with identity for a person is that, unless you have a cool name like Vanilla Ice, there aren&#8217;t many visuals or references to funnel into a design so you end up with a typographic solution which usually leads to very basic designs. Here, Melbourne, Australia-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ryanromanes.co.nz\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ryan Romanes<\/a> has put together a beautiful type solution that renders the JOS name in a stencil serif approach that leads to a great business card where one side looks like a cryptic punctuation message but the other provides the answer. Those bits and pieces from the serif are then used as an abstract graphic device that is actually a pattern that once again forms the JOS name. Very nicely and smartly done. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ryanromanes.co.nz\/projects.php?id=33\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"A little bit of everything in this week&apos;s selections with work from Charleston, Brooklyn, and Melbourne&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[953,786,265],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3823"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3823"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3823\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3823"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3823"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3823"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
