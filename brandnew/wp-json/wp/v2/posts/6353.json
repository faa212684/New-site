In 1975, the company broadened its focus to include bagged teas and began to sell a full line of traditional, specialty blend, and herbal teas directly to fine restaurants and through a mail order catalog to consumers. Today, we are headquartered in Tigard, Oregon, a suburb of Portland. Stash Tea is now one of the largest specialty tea companies in the United States, with products available through foodservice, grocery stores, tea and coffee shops, club stores, mass merchandisers, natural foods stores, mail order, and online. We are also available in Canada, and several other countries. Stash Tea derives its name from an entertaining aspect of tea folklore. In earlier centuries, tea was a valuable commodity traditionally transported by clipper ship. The ship&#8217;s captain was often presented with the finest teas for his personal use. This supply was his &#8216;stash,&#8217; kept as his &#8216;private reserve.&#8217; Today, the term is still used to denote anything put away carefully because of its preciousness.&#8221;<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/stash_tea_logo.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Stash Tea by Jolby &amp; Friends\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/stash_tea_wordmark_and_pattern.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Stash Tea by Jolby &amp; Friends\" \/>\n<figcaption>Alternate logo and pattern.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/stash_tea_packaging_before_after.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Stash Tea by Jolby &amp; Friends\" \/>\n<figcaption>Packaging, before and after.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/stash_tea_packaging_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Stash Tea by Jolby &amp; Friends\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/stash_tea_packaging_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Stash Tea by Jolby &amp; Friends\" \/>\n<figcaption>New packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/stash_tea_packaging_ingredient_style.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Stash Tea by Jolby &amp; Friends\" \/>\n<figcaption>Ingredient photography and composition.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\" style=\"padding-bottom: 62.25%;\"><video controls autoplay loop><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/stash_tea_animation_type.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Container flexibility.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/stash_tea_packaging_a_lot.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Stash Tea by Jolby &amp; Friends\" \/>\n<figcaption>Lots of new packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/stash_tea_packaging_individual.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Stash Tea by Jolby &amp; Friends\" \/>\n<figcaption>Envelopes.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/stash_tea_packaging_tags.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Stash Tea by Jolby &amp; Friends\" \/>\n<figcaption>Tags.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"(Est. 1972) &quot;The Stash Tea Company was founded in Portland in 1972 and operated out of an old Victorian-style house, supplying loose herbal teas and bulk herbs to natural food stores.
