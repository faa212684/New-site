Their flagship beer Bor\u00e9ale comes in seven variations that range from an IPA to a stout. Last month, the brewery introduced a new logo and identity for Bor\u00e9ale designed by Montreal- and Qu\u00e9bec-based <a href=\"http:\/\/lg2boutique.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">lg2boutique<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>The image update is inspired by its new positioning, &#8220;Celebrate life naturally&#8221;, a nod to Bor\u00e9ale&#8217;s legacy, its authenticity, the call of the wild, the thirst for freedom and the rejection of the superficial.<\/blockquote><h3>lg2boutique provided press release<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/boreale_logo.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Bor\u00e9ale by lg2boutique\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The typography and the blue color in the old logo made it look like it belonged on yoghurt packaging, more than beer. The polar bear &#8212; alluding to the polar lights or aurora borealis &#8212; remains the exact same shape but its shading has been changed to a subtle tone-on-tone that makes a huge difference in how much more elegant it looks. I would have personally taken out some of the smile as it begins to feel too much like a caricature. Changing from the serif on a curve to a straight-up condensed wordmark is a big improvement as well and I love the embedded accent over the &#8220;E&#8221;. The more relevant change is that the two elements can be used separately and not always in a lock-up, as seen in the new bottles.<\/p>\n<blockquote>Freed from the main logo, the emblematic bear is enhanced and is at the heart of the new identity. Everything has been designed to attract consumers, to invite them to reconsider and rediscover Bor\u00e9ale products.<\/blockquote><h3>lg2boutique provided press release<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/boreale_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Bor\u00e9ale by lg2boutique\" \/>\n<figcaption>Bottle, before and after.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/boreale_04.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Bor\u00e9ale by lg2boutique\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/boreale_05.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Bor\u00e9ale by lg2boutique\" \/>\n<figcaption>Bottles.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/boreale_06.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Bor\u00e9ale by lg2boutique\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/boreale_07.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Bor\u00e9ale by lg2boutique\" \/>\n<figcaption>Bottle details.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old bottles were fairly ambitious for a microbrewery, with its custom die-cuts on the body and neck labels and the design, although a little misguided in style, was not all bad. The new label keeps the special die-cut treatment for the bear but quadruples its real estate, making it overly prominent and setting it up as the key identifying element of the bottle. It&#8217;s different, for sure, and striking in the whiteness of the bear against the brown of the bottle. The neck label feels a little disconnected in aesthetic &#8212; the bottom has plenty of texture with the bear&#8217;s fur and the landscape&#8217;s shading &#8212; but it&#8217;s nice on its own. The caps are stunning in their dark blue.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/boreale_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Bor\u00e9ale by lg2boutique\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/boreale_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Bor\u00e9ale by lg2boutique\" \/>\n<figcaption>6-pack, before and after.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/boreale_10.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Bor\u00e9ale by lg2boutique\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/boreale_11.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Bor\u00e9ale by lg2boutique\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/boreale_12.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Bor\u00e9ale by lg2boutique\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/boreale_13.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Bor\u00e9ale by lg2boutique\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/boreale_14.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Bor\u00e9ale by lg2boutique\" \/>\n<figcaption>6-packs.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The concept of the full bear coming around the bottle is expressed on one of the sides of the 6-pack and that&#8217;s part of what makes the bottle work, seeing it paired with the full drawing of the bear. The typography and hierarchy on the 6-packs is top-notch and dead-simple. The colored landscapes play a bigger role for color-coding the beers and the stripes of color contrast beautifully with the dark blue.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/boreale_15.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Bor\u00e9ale by lg2boutique\" \/>\n<figcaption>12-pack.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/boreale_09.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Bor\u00e9ale by lg2boutique\" \/>\n<figcaption>Cans.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/boreale_08.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Bor\u00e9ale by lg2boutique\" \/>\n<figcaption>6-pack, bottle, can, and pint.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/boreale_16.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Bor\u00e9ale by lg2boutique\" \/>\n<figcaption>Pint.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/boreale_17.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Bor\u00e9ale by lg2boutique\" \/>\n<figcaption>Livery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">Overall, this is a stunning execution.
