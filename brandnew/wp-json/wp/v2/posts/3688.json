Currently home to the O2 Arena and entertainment district, the project will cover a 160-acre site and include 10,000 homes and 3.5 million square feet of commercial space, all of which will rely on a &#8220;District Heat Network&#8221; (underground pipes, basically) developed and operated by Loka. Its name and identity have been created by Exeter, UK-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.believein.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Believe In<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>The name Loka means &#8216;local&#8217; in Esperanto, a universal language created to foster harmony between people. It also references low carbon, a key ambition of the network&#8217;s approach to energy generation and supply. The bold logotype is formed of geometric shapes inspired by the Greenwich Peninsula identity, and is supported by a range of illustrations by <a href=\"http:\/\/sodavekt.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sodavekt<\/a>.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.believein.co.uk\/#\/work\/greenwich-peninsula-loka-identity\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Believe In project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/loka_logo_detail.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Loka Energy by Believe In\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/loka_icon_detail.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Loka Energy by Believe In\" \/>\n<figcaption>&#8220;Energy O&#8221; icon.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Well, this is different. And unexpected. And possibly a really very ugly thing. I like it! The wordmark is not the most pleasant set of geometric shapes ever assembled but &mdash; no pun intended &mdash; they have an interesting energy to them that stands apart from any energy company ever, anywhere. It can get away with its eccentricity as Loka will not have a competitor and it will operate in a forward-looking redevelopment project full of fancy and novel things. It&#8217;s oddly appropriate and repellingly attractive &mdash; as much as I want to hate that stumpy &#8220;a&#8221; I can&#8217;t. The &#8220;Energy O&#8221; icon, with its warm gradient is a cool device but, compared to the wordmark, it&#8217;s not as innovative or engaging.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/loka_illustration_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Loka Energy by Believe In\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/loka_illustration_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Loka Energy by Believe In\" \/>\n<figcaption>Illustrations.
