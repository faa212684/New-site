It&#8217;s located inland between Romania to the west and Ukraine to the rest of the sides and has an estimated population of 3 million. A quick Google Image search returns images of beautiful landscapes and great old structures (and some sadder war images). Late last year, the <a href=\"http:\/\/turism.gov.md\/index.php?&#038;l=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tourism Agency of Moldova<\/a>, with the help of the <a href=\"http:\/\/ceed.md\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">USAID CEED II Project<\/a>, launched a new tourism brand, <a href=\"http:\/\/moldovaholiday.travel\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Moldova Holiday<\/a>, with an identity designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.publicis.md\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Publicis Moldova<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/liVLOQKsHe8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>First, a quick taste of Moldova in this new spot.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The Tree of Life &mdash; ancient symbol representing the continuous renewal and cyclicity, eternal youth and immortality.It is also a Christian symbol of connection between heaven and earth.<br \/><br \/>The roots of the Tree are deep in the traditions and customs of our ancestors, branches with fruit speak about the development and growth nowadays.The symbol of the Tree can be found in many traditional art and craft works.<\/blockquote><h3>Provided guideline documents<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/moldova_tourism_inspiration.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Tourism Agency of Moldova by Publicis Moldova\" \/>\n<figcaption>Source of reference.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/moldova_tourism_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Tourism Agency of Moldova by Publicis Moldova\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/moldova_tourism_logo_meaning.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Tourism Agency of Moldova by Publicis Moldova\" \/>\n<figcaption>Explanation of the elements. (Slow animated GIF)<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>I&#8217;m always a fan of logos that have multiple components that can all be neatly rationalized and, at least in that regard, this logo does it quite nicely by placing different elements at the end of each branch. The execution of the icon is both great and&hellip; not so great. I like the overall effect and how it looks reduced but the overlapping shapes appear as unresolved and distracting. The wordmark is very bland and the spacing too tight to work at small sizes. Nonetheless, it has a good overall vibe.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/moldova_tourism_alternate_uses.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Tourism Agency of Moldova by Publicis Moldova\" \/>\n<figcaption>Alternate uses.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/moldova_tourism_noroc.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Tourism Agency of Moldova by Publicis Moldova\" \/>\n<figcaption>&#8220;Noroc&#8221;, a common greeting in Moldova.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/moldova_tourism_country_outline.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Tourism Agency of Moldova by Publicis Moldova\" \/>\n<figcaption>The country&#8217;s outline.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The ability to use the visual language in words and other shapes gives this identity a lot of flexibility and recognizability. But, as in the Noroc application, it starts to look to much like builder kids&#8217; toys because of the overlapping joints.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/moldova_tourism_pattern_01.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Tourism Agency of Moldova by Publicis Moldova\" \/>\n<figcaption>As pattern.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/moldova_tourism_pattern_02.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Tourism Agency of Moldova by Publicis Moldova\" \/>\n<figcaption>Alternate monochrome patterns.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/moldova_tourism_pattern_line.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Tourism Agency of Moldova by Publicis Moldova\" \/>\n<figcaption>Single filigree-ish pattern.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Cropping in on the icon makes for a good hero graphic and the monochrome patterns add versatility to future applications &mdash; although it starts to look like circuit boards (as in the yellow on yellow pattern). The thin border application might be my favorite part of the project.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/moldova_tourism_various_applications.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Tourism Agency of Moldova by Publicis Moldova\" \/>\n<figcaption>A few prototype applications.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/moldova_tourism_real.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Tourism Agency of Moldova by Publicis Moldova\" \/>\n<figcaption>Not the most flattering photos but just to show that this is out there in the real world.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">Overall, this is a strong system with plenty of moving parts to allow for a broad range of applications. It&#8217;s very colorful and full of references to Moldova. Even the crappy photos of the limited range of applications created so far look promising. Noroc!
