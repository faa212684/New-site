It&#8217;s unclear exactly what it is or means but it communicates movement between two points and, yeah, it has arrows. The typography, last updated in 1990 was fairly comical with the round &#8220;E&#8221; and drowning &#8220;S&#8221;. The new logo is an evolution that, probably unintentionally, pays perfect homage to its predecessor: The new icon is some kind of ambiguous arrow\/banner shapes and some equally comical typography with a pair of bland &#8220;r&#8221;s, an &#8220;e&#8221; with an overbite, and a tittle-less &#8220;i&#8221;. The icon picks up from the realistic\/gradient trend of the early 2000s and the typography picks up the current <a href=\"http:\/\/cuttingedgelogos.tumblr.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cut-off<\/a> trend &mdash; neither are good on their own and combined make for an even less appealing result.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/correios_ad_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Correios by CDA\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/correios_ad_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Correios by CDA\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/correios_ad_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Correios by CDA\" \/>\n<figcaption>Launch ads.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Seeing the ads above, I could potentially rally behind the new icon, because it does work quite well when propped, in its full 3D-ness, against other objects, enveloping them in an engaging way. This effect is also well played in the video. You can also see a convincing flat-color version in the retail shot below. It&#8217;s not bad. And the retail look also has potential when designed from the ground up. As a band-aid on some run-down locations it just doesn&#8217;t quite hold up.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/correios_retail.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Correios by CDA\" \/>\n<figcaption>New retail look.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/correios_retail_less_sexy.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Correios by CDA\" \/>\n<figcaption>A slightly less sexy (and more real) new retail look.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/correios_kit.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Correios by CDA\" \/>\n<figcaption>Kit sent to Brazilian sports personalities, like national swimmer <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BFratus\/status\/464088825288204288\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bruno Fratus<\/a>.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/correios_press_thingie.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Correios by CDA\" \/>\n<figcaption>A couple of other sports stars at a press event, holding quite evenly the new logo in their hands.
