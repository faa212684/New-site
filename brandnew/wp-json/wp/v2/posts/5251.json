The textures were created by letting different oils, vinegars, and inks interact and they abstractly represent the funky names of the beers: Wapatoolie, Papi Chulo, Marvolo, and Aureole. The logo and typography are arguably too light but the backgrounds are so awesome and distinctive that they would be easily identified on store shelves (even though most sales happen at Commonwealth&#8217;s facility and tasting room in a renovated fire station). <a href=\"http:\/\/thirstcraft.com\/work\/commonwealth-brewing-company\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a> <\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Modern by Dwell Magazine by Collins<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_modernbydwell.jpg\" alt=\"Modern by Dwell Magazine by Collins\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.target.com\/c\/modern-by-dwell-magazine\/-\/N-4sjwd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Modern by Dwell Magazine<\/a> is a new line of home products available exclusively at Target designed in partnership with <em>Dwell<\/em> magazine with a minimalist, modern aesthetic. The identity and packaging, designed by New York, NY-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wearecollins.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Collins<\/a>, working with the Target Creative Team, has a stunning simplicity and sharpness that hinges on a great wordmark for &#8220;Modern&#8221; that always sits perpendicular to the canvas (be it a box or a hang tag) creating some great tension. The yellow, gray, and black color palette is unexpected for a mainstream home decor product and it helps accentuate the product photography and I&#8217;m sure it has a fantastic shelf presence at the visually-overloading environment that is Target. Bonus points for beautiful project photography. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wearecollins.com\/work\/modern-by-dwell-magazine\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a> (<a href=\"http:\/\/bpando.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Via BP&amp;O)<\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Filidoro Artesanal by Tricota<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_filidoro.jpg\" alt=\"Filidoro Artesanal by Tricota\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/FilidoroArtesanal\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Filidoro Artesanal<\/a> is a microbrewery in Buenos Aires, Argentina, with a rooster-fronting identity designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tricota.com.ar\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tricota<\/a>. The rooster has a great, rugged personality with a multi-photocopied texture that makes for a cool recurring aesthetic. I love how they have pimped the rooster for the different beers, keeping the same expression throughout but adding funnily embarrassing flourishes like a pompadour, a monocle, and Irish hat. No offense to anyone who wears these on a regular basis. The typography is a little on the urban lumberjack hipster aesthetic but it goes really well with the rooster drawing, works great with the low-fi applications, and clearly shows a company wanting to have fun with its product. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/47666721\/FILIDORO-Argentinian-Brewery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Some crisp modernism sandwiched in between two highly expressive breweries this week, with work from Glasgow, New York, and Buenos Aires&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[51,11,26],"tags":[1122,1371],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5251"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=5251"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5251\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=5251"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=5251"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=5251"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
