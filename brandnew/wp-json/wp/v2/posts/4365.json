The identity, designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/heystudio.es\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hey<\/a>, uses a sharp Woody-Allen-esque serif to convey a certain old-time-y-ness and pairs it with a torn paper graphic device. Usually cloying, the torn paper in the vibrant color palette looks groovy and energetic on the shoe boxes, accentuated by the hex blue wordmark. The torn paper gesture continues (or maybe comes from) the brochure where the outer layer of a double cover is ripped by hand for each copy, creating a very authentic and organic feel. Shoes look great too! <a href=\"http:\/\/heystudio.es\/projects\/arrels\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Flamingo by Biblioth&egrave;que<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_flamingo.jpg\" alt=\"Flamingo by Biblioth&egrave;que\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/flamingogroup.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Flamingo<\/a> is a global insight and strategy consultancy with seven offices around the world providing their clients with &#8220;consumer, cultural and strategic expertise to create opportunities for growth.&#8221; Even for a company with a quirky name, the chosen typeface for the identity &mdash; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.myfonts.com\/fonts\/bitstream\/belwe\/?refby=ucllc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Belwe<\/a> &mdash; designed by London-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bibliothequedesign.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Biblioth&egrave;que<\/a> is very unexpected and off the beaten path. It&#8217;s really all in that fantastic lowercase &#8220;g&#8221; that has attitude to spare. Most of the applications are just the logo centered but the business card with a debossed frame to enclose the logo and place the information around it is a very highlightable application. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bibliothequedesign.com\/projects\/branding\/flamingo\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a> <span class=\"gray_100\">(Via <a href=\"http:\/\/bpando.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BP&amp;O<\/a>)<\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Bearleader Chronicle by The Studio<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_bearleader.jpg\" alt=\"Bearleader Chronicle by The Studio\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">The last of our serif entries comes from <a href=\"http:\/\/bearleaderchronicle.com\/site\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bearleader Chronicle<\/a>, a monthly online travel magazine published from New York, NY. The identity, designed by Stockholm, Sweden-based <a href=\"http:\/\/the-studio.se\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Studio<\/a> features the least bombastic serif of the series that is nonetheless a beautiful choice &mdash; <strike>anyone know what it is?<\/strike> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.radimpesko.com\/fonts\/larish-neue\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Larish Neue<\/a> (thanks Julien H&eacute;bert!) &mdash; with enough flair to stand out and support the overly minimal applications. The paper color choices also help pull this off with basically no other design elements. My only complaint would be the thin &#8220;C&#8221; in the monogram version of the logo that should have been redrawn to match the blackness of the &#8220;B&#8221; and period instead of just shrunk down. Nonetheless, a handsome travel companion in the world of travel online travel magazines. <a href=\"http:\/\/the-studio.se\/work\/bearleader\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/strong><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"This week we have a collection of serif-driven identities from Barcelona, London, and Stockholm&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[33,510,697],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4365"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4365"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4365\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4365"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4365"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4365"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
