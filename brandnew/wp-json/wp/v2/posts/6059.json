Along with the name change, the company is also introducing a recyclable wax paper cup, each filled with the ingredients needed &#8212; vegetables, fruits, seeds, nuts, specialty milks, powders, etc. &#8212; that can be stored in the freezer, poured into the blender when ready, and poured back in the cup for enjoyment.

Natural Blender became Batch Organics, a no frills moniker that heroes the product&#8217;s organic goodness.<br \/><br \/>Visually, we steered clear of the handwritten type and fiddly logo conventions of the category. A bold, clean brand typography and wordmark create a fresh look that is unmistakably Batch Organics. Although the font is functional in style, the soft, inward curls of the &#8216;G&#8217;, &#8216;C&#8217; and &#8216;S&#8217;, add a touch of personality.<br \/><br \/>Food brands often package products in different colours for different flavours. To make it stand out, we gave Batch Organics a single colour it could own across a range of products. We complemented this stripped back colour palette with food photography centering delicious smoothie ingredients.<br \/><br \/>Verbally, an assertive tone of voice helped bring the new brand attitude to life. Pithy, straight-talking headlines communicate a frank, fuss-free ethos.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/raggededge.com\/work\/batch-organics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ragged Edge project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/batch_organics_logo.png\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Batch Organics by Ragged Edge\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo was okay, nothing too exciting or annoying; the overlapping wobbly circles hinted at blending so it did a good job in communicating something about the product. The new logo doesn&#8217;t convey anything about nothing on its own but it establishes a cooler personality for the company with a blunt uppercase wordmark &#8212; typeset in <a href=\"https:\/\/store.typenetwork.com\/foundry\/fontbureau\/fonts\/bureau-grot\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bureau Grotesque<\/a> (one of my favorite sans serifs) &#8212; in hot pink. It operates in the undesigned aesthetic but the combination of the matter-of-fact name and slightly quirky curves of Bureau Grotesque add up to a peculiar one-two punch that works great in application, with everything served straight-up.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/batch_organics_brand_statements.gif\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Batch Organics by Ragged Edge\" \/>\n<figcaption>Copywriting.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>&#8220;Faff&#8221;.

I love how such a simple gesture as putting a quarter of the wordmark on top of the photograph makes the cup infinitely more interesting. The light pink background also make the cups different from anything else on the market, especially anything else in the health\/smoothie category. The ingredient photography first comes across as another too-cool-for-school, unadorned styling but it&#8217; also really well done in how it integrates with the packaging by having bright colored backgrounds that offset against the light pink but also complement the hot pink over them. And I really like how the photos are, like, a rectangle, smacked on the cups.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/batch_organics_packaging_box.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Batch Organics by Ragged Edge\" \/>\n<figcaption>Box.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">I assume Batch Organics isn&#8217;t huge in the UK but if this service were to become extremely popular the pink cups could be as distinctive as a green and white Starbucks cup or a black and white Saks Fifth Avenue bag where its carriers share a common bond and unspoken appreciation for each other&#8217;s good taste. Rhapsodizing aside, this is a fantastic change that feels youthful, energetic, and breaking category conventions.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 2015 as Natural Blender, Batch Organics is a health food brand that delivers (in the UK) flash-frozen, organic smoothie ingredients ready to be blended.
