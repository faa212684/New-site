If this looks or sounds familiar, yes, it&#8217;s similar to 826 Valencia&#8217;s organization and faux stores (Monster Supply Store, Time Travel Mart, etc.) where kids attend workshops and people buy themed faux things. Ministry of Stories also operates the <a href=\"http:\/\/ministryofstories.org\/shop\/monster-supplies\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hoxton Street Monster Supplies<\/a> in London. For this Harry-Potter-meets-Target version, Sheffield-based <a href=\"http:\/\/side-side.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Side by Side<\/a> created a simple, old-timey-looking identity system that&#8217;s kind of the Swiss Style of magical artifact branding. One typeface, centered, always in uppercase. It&#8217;s not the most &#8220;creative&#8221; design but it works, well, like magic when applied to all the fun products and clever copywriting. The space itself is wonderful too with a lot of great details.

Its packaging, designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/etiquette.lt\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\u00e9tiquette<\/a>, reflects the effect their products have on the skin through a set of color-coded, heavy gradients that go from the base tan color to a range of red, blues, and greens. It&#8217;s a deceivingly simple system but it creates a perfectly branded family of products supported by simple and crisp typography. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/34562151\/YOU-OIL-natural-cosmetics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Tidningshuset by Pontus by Bold<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_tidningshuset.jpg\" alt=\"Tidningshuset by Pontus by Bold\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/pontusfrithiof.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tidningshuset by Pontus<\/a> (House of Magazines or Newspapers in Swedish) is a restaurant, deli, and bakery in Stockholm run by restaurateur Pontus Frithiof and located in the building where Sweden&#8217;s largest newspaper, <em>Dagens Nyheter<\/em>, is headquartered. Local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.boldscandinavia.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bold<\/a> used its neighbor as inspiration for the identity by putting a traditional masthead blackletter to work to entice passersby to stop by for a bite. The blackletter is paired with Trade Gothic to create a strikingly contrasting logo that looks great in black and greater in the key red-orange color. The applications are very simple and straightforward, letting the strong typography do the work. Some bonus playful bundles of Trade Gothic (like &#8220;Lunch&#8221;) are spread through the space. Overall, it&#8217;s a nice balance of serious and playful. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.boldscandinavia.com\/work\/tidningshuset\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Simplicity reigns today with work from London, Vilnius, and Stockholm&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[53,564,149],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4553"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4553"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4553\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4553"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4553"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4553"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
