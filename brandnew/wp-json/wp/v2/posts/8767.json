The identity, designed by Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia-based <a href=\"https:\/\/wheresgut.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Where&#8217;s Gut Studio<\/a>, brings to life the made-up mythology of Tono, a sloth-like-maybe-human-I-don&#8217;t-want-to-make-wrong-assumptions-being depicted in a strange but alluring illustration. The thin line-art and how the legs and arms blend into each other is kind of groovy and the red\/orange face, while also on the slightly creepy side, adds a bold spark of color. The fragility of the character is nicely offset by the bold and simple wordmark. I don&#8217;t imagine this being a super popular project in the voting but I thought it was unique enough to point out. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/wheresgut.com\/project\/tono-crafted-soy-milk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Redfish by Welcome Stranger<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_redfish.jpg\" alt=\"Redfish by Welcome Stranger\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.redfishpoke.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Redfish<\/a> is a poke restaurant in Honolulu, HI &#8212; owned by Foodland, a supermarket chain with 32 stores in Hawaii &#8212; serving fresh, customizable poke bowls and hearty shared plates with beer, wine, and sake. Their identity, designed by local firm <a href=\"https:\/\/www.welcomestranger.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Welcome Stranger<\/a>, is &#8220;inspired by vintage Foodland photos and historical supermarket ephemera&#8221;, including the diamond pattern found in the facade of Foodland&#8217;s first store that opened in 1948. From there, the identity builds a number of badges, type treatments, and illustrations all with a vintage Americana flair but with some contemporary touches that move it beyond pastiche. The applications are not necessarily jaw-dropping but the full visual language (best seen at the project link) is fairly satisfying and the restaurant&#8217;s brand promise of &#8220;Warm Rice, Cold Beer, and Raw Fish&#8221; sounds like something I could get on board with right now. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.welcomestranger.co\/redfish\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Sesi\u00f3n by Re<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_sesion.jpg\" alt=\"Sesi\u00f3n by Re\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sesiontequila.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sesi\u00f3n<\/a> is a brand of premium tequila produced in Jalisco, Mexico, and sold in Australia, where vodka and gin lead the spirit category. The identity and packaging, designed by Sydney, Australia-based <a href=\"https:\/\/re.agency\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Re<\/a>, positions tequila as the slow-sipping, mature spirit that it is (as opposed to its let&#8217;s-do-shots-and-get-drunk reputation where you can&#8217;t really savor it) with a clear high-end aesthetic from logo to bottle. The wordmark is a simple sans serif with the &#8220;\u00d3&#8221; in it dipping as if it were a sunset, which is not an entirely original move but the presence of the accent over the &#8220;O&#8221; gives it a little extra flair. The one thing I don&#8217;t quite like is the agave icon, which doesn&#8217;t feel as refined as the logo, the rest of the typography, or the slick bottle silhouette. The boxes with the big type broken in pairs&#8230; I&#8217;m not sure is quite right for the brand but it definitely looks cool. And I&#8217;m hugely, deeply, droolingly intrigued by the Mocha variety. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/re.agency\/sesion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"A whole day&apos;s worth of sustenance this week &#8212; soy milk for breakfast, poke for lunch, and tequila for dinner &#8212; with work from Kuala Lumpur, Honolulu, and Sydney&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[51,11,85,26],"tags":[294,757,621,1639,902,1118],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8767"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=8767"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8767\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=8767"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=8767"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=8767"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
