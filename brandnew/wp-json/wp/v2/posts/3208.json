The organization&#8217;s new name and identity were created by London-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.venturethree.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">venturethree<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>We created the brand strategy for the new initiative and the brand name Internet Matters &mdash; with a double meaning &mdash; to reflect the fact that this is a serious-modern day issue that parents haven&#8217;t had to deal with before.<br \/><br \/>Our objective was to create something engaging and informative with high impact &mdash; yet to also be clear that this wasn&#8217;t about telling parents how to be better parents. Instead it&#8217;s about encouraging them to talk about the internet with their children, learn about important information to keep them safe, and what action to take to deal with issues should they arise. We summed it up with the tagline &#8216;Learn about it. Talk about it. Deal with it.&#8217;<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.venturethree.com\/work\/project\/internet-matters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">venturethree project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/internet_matters_org_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Internet Matters by venturethree\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail with tagline.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/94529563?portrait=0&amp;color=f0001c\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Typing in the logo.

The big dots in the logo &mdash; in the &#8220;i&#8221; and the dot &mdash; help it shout and call some attention to itself while the rest of the typography looks bright and handsome against the vibrant green. There is not much to it, but it&#8217;s very nicely done. (Although sometimes the big tittles get in the way of other letters as seen in the videos above and it&#8217;s not ideal.)<\/p>\n<blockquote>[When] we were doing our research for the campaign, the facts were so arresting that we made them a core part of the brand identity. Presenting them with complete neutrality nailed the awareness right away. And we kept the look super-simple and based around the vernacular of the internet, from sounds to symbols to the most popular fonts used online.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.venturethree.com\/work\/project\/internet-matters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">venturethree project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/internet_matters_org_ad_01.png\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Internet Matters by venturethree\" \/>\n<br \/><br \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/internet_matters_org_ad_02.png\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Internet Matters by venturethree\" \/>\n<br \/><br \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/internet_matters_org_ad_03.png\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Internet Matters by venturethree\" \/>\n<figcaption>Various ads.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/94529360?portrait=0&amp;color=f0001c\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Animated fact.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/94529562?portrait=0&amp;color=f0001c\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Animated fact.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">The limited applications, for now, are in the form of static and animated ads that take their cues from the basic common denominators of the internet&#8217;s visual language: the ubiquitous fonts (Verdana, Courier, Comic Sans, and Georgia), boinky sound effects, RGB color palette, and white Microsoft cursor. The results are not necessarily appealing as we understand appealing-ness but they communicate efficiently and directly &mdash; and the ugly-on-purpose-design-lover in me really likes this. Overall, it&#8217;s a simple and striking campaign that should get parents to pay attention.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Launched today, Internet Matters is a joint initiative from the four major internet service providers in the UK &mdash; Sky, Talk Talk, BT, and Virgin Media &mdash; that establishes &#8220;an independent, not-for-profit organisation to help parents keep their children safe&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[12,79,26],"tags":[319,148,933,1047,537],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3208"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3208"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3208\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3208"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3208"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3208"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
