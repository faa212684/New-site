Running Google&#8217;s Android OS and coming in at 7 inches (and HD) with 16 Gb of storage and a &pound;119 ($190) price it competes in between Google&#8217;s own Nexus 7 (&pound;199 \/ $318) and Amazon&#8217;s Kindle Fire (&pound;99 \/ $158) &mdash; also, it sure ain&#8217;t no iPad but the iPad is more than double its price at &pound;269 ($430). Hudl will be available starting September 30 in four, Tesco-friendly colors and it will boost Tesco&#8217;s own range of digital services as well as its own reward card, encouraging people to shop through the tablet. The new logo and packaging were designed by London-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.someoneinlondon.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SomeOne<\/a>. A national campaign will launch in October, created by W+K.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>Gary Holt, Founder &amp; ECD explains &#8220;the tablet is becoming an important device in people&#8217;s lives, notably family lives, ideal for online shopping, digital entertainment and social networking and as such they are emerging as a &#8216;retail portal&#8217; of the future. Tesco have responded to this change by launching a tablet that is both great value and a great spec&#8221;.<br \/><br \/>The identity is intended to represent this strategy, using a solar system metaphor that reflects Hudl being at the centre of a digital orbit, and of family life.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.someoneinlondon.com\/category\/projects\/launching-tescos-first-tablet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SomeOne case study<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Hudl_logo_detail.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Hudl by SomeOne\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo in constellation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hudl_icons.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Hudl by SomeOne\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icon set.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hudl_tablet_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Hudl by SomeOne\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hudl_tablet_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Hudl by SomeOne\" \/>\n<figcaption>The tablet.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hudl_kid_friendly.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Hudl by SomeOne\" \/>\n<figcaption>Kid-friendly accessories.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The new logo follows in the simplicity-driven approach of other tablets, from the iPad to the Nook to the Nexus 7. Just a wordmark that will look elegant on the device, which should be the center of attention. The elongated ascenders of the Hudl logo are a little too ascending for my taste but there is absolutely nothing wrong with it. It&#8217;s not overly exciting either. The star as a period is a nice touch and becomes the graphic hinge upon which the rest of the identity revolves &mdash; almost literally, since the metaphor is an orbit.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hudl_packaging_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Hudl by SomeOne\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hudl_packaging_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Hudl by SomeOne\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hudl_packaging_013.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Hudl by SomeOne\" \/>\n<figcaption>Different views of the packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hudl_packaging_04.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Hudl by SomeOne\" \/>\n<figcaption>Transparent film with instructions.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>Laura Hussey, Partner and Creative Director adds &#8220;We wanted to inject warmth into a category that can often be overly technical. A growing body of research suggests that the way to influence&#8211;and to be a great leader&#8211;is by demonstrating warmth. Our swooping, curving shapes, warm colours and customised options help to soften what can often be stark &#038; technologically-led communications&#8221;.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.someoneinlondon.com\/category\/projects\/launching-tescos-first-tablet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SomeOne case study<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hudl_packaging_stuffs.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Hudl by SomeOne\" \/>\n<figcaption>Printed material in the box.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hudl_website.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Hudl by SomeOne\" \/>\n<figcaption>Website.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hudl_kid.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Hudl by SomeOne\" \/>\n<figcaption>Look at how happy that boy is.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">The packaging and rest of the materials have a slight low-end look and feel, which is very appropriate. The device can&#8217;t look and feel like an iPad box, even if it follows some of the same conventions: white background, big picture of the product. This doesn&#8217;t mean the design is bad, it&#8217;s not, it means that it&#8217;s good in that it fits the price point. The shooting stars are really the best part about the system, they help add some firework-y graphic appeal and element of consistency. Overall, the identity is simple and without much visual fanfare, relying more on the selling horsepower of Tesco than on packaging&#8217;s or tablet&#8217;s shelf appeal.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"This week, Tesco, the third largest retailer in the world (after Walmart and Carrefour) with more than 2,000 retail locations and 20 million customers worldwide, launched its own tablet: Hudl.
