If the name sounds familiar &mdash; but not as familiar as say Dell, Apple, Microsoft, etc. &mdash; Lenovo is the official owner of the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/ThinkPad\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ThinkPad<\/a> range of laptops originally created by IBM, from whom Lenovo acquired its personal computer business in 2005. Additionally, Lenovo has been expanding into the smartphone market since 2012 &mdash; recently acquiring Google&#8217;s Motorola Mobility &mdash; and now offers workstations, servers, storage, smart TVs, and tablets. In other words, it&#8217;s gotten big. This past week, at the company&#8217;s Tech World event in Beijing, Lenovo introduced a new logo designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/saatchiny.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Saatchi &amp; Saatchi New York<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Q6I9nWsjvso\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>David Roman, Lenovo&#8217;s Chief Marketing Officer talks about the new Lenovo logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lenovo_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Lenovo by Saatchi &amp; Saatchi New York\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The cornerstone of our new identity is our new logo &mdash; a mark that is made up of two key elements. First, there&#8217;s the word Lenovo, which we&#8217;ve designed in a more contemporary way, making it more readable so there are no pronunciation issues around the world.  More importantly, this wordmark is housed in a containing shape, which is meant to be more than just a design element. It acts as a window into culture and the world that surrounds us, housing a range of images, colors and patterns.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/blog.lenovo.com\/en\/blog\/the-new-lenovo-never-stands-still\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lenovo blog post<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lenovo_logo_alts.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Lenovo by Saatchi &amp; Saatchi New York\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo as window and color palette.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The previous logo wasn&#8217;t great. I want to put more praise on the unconventional &#8220;e&#8221; but it&#8217;s really not that cool and the rest of the wordmark isn&#8217;t particularly interesting. Perhaps in the technology world it has some equity but as a consumer brand I doubt it has much outside China, where its smartphones rule. Between the video press conference and the quote above you would think the new logo was a drastic departure from the previous logo and the most innovative execution in logo design since flip phones. It&#8217;s certainly &#8220;nicer&#8221; in that it&#8217;s more normal but that&#8217;s about it. The slanted &#8220;e&#8221; is as exciting as the otherwise very normal wordmark goes. Placing it in a rectangle with colors and imagery that changes doesn&#8217;t make it any better or more strategically relevant or a window into a culture. It&#8217;s now one of the oldest tricks in the book. And we all know there is no magic behind it anymore.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lenovo_techworld_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Lenovo by Saatchi &amp; Saatchi New York\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lenovo_techworld_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Lenovo by Saatchi &amp; Saatchi New York\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lenovo_techworld_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Lenovo by Saatchi &amp; Saatchi New York\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo in action at the recent Techworld.

It&#8217;s all still relatively bland but at least in application it has some energy to it that could evolve into a recognizable identity.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1984 (originally named Legend), Lenovo is a multinational technology company based in Beijing, China, (and Morrisville, North Carolina).
