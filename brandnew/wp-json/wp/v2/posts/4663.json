The identity by Yerevan, Armenia-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.backbonebranding.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Backbone Branding<\/a> features a great logo where the &#8220;THE&#8221; in the name is made up of wood planks and arranged like a shack. It&#8217;s a simple pleasure to see it happen. It&#8217;s not the best shack representation ever but the idea comes across instantly and, more importantly, it begins to convey the feel of the restaurant. The logo is complemented by a series of spray-painted illustrations of lobsters, crabs, squids, and more, repeated in circular patterns. I&#8217;m not sure if that&#8217;s the best complement for the logo &#8212; although spray paint on wood, yes, it works &#8212; but they provide a great texture and fun vibe.

The identity revolves around an abstract, flexible &#8220;M&#8221; that can stretch and adapt to any canvas and still read as an &#8220;M&#8221; as well as convert the top of almost any business collateral into an &#8220;M&#8221;. Expensive but classy. The full wordmark has a nice extra touch in that the &#8220;K&#8221; is a rotated &#8220;M&#8221;.

The identity by Manila-based <a href=\"http:\/\/and-a-half.ph\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">And A Half<\/a> is a concoction of a superb condensed slab serif, funny illustrations (not shown above but plenty at the link), and a killer triangular pattern that matches the shape of the churro-holding packaging which has its own, integrated cup holder for a small serving of dipping chocolate to dunk those churros. The colors are meant to represent the Mexican flag, since that&#8217;s where churros originated. Overall, this is a brand that is clearly having fun with its product and the excitement extends to all their promotions and materials. <a href=\"http:\/\/and-a-half.ph\/projects\/la-lola-churreria\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"A minimalist identity sandwiched in between a couple of maximalist projects today, with work from Yerevan, Barcelona, and Manila&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[39,564],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4663"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4663"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4663\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4663"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4663"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4663"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
