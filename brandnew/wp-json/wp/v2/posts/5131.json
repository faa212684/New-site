(My older brother &#8212; in the 1980s, in Mexico City &#8212; was an ardent fan.) Juventus is the second oldest (and still active) team in the country &#8212; Genoa is the oldest &#8212; and has won 61 national and international official titles. Yesterday, the team introduced a new logo and identity designed by the Milan office of <a href=\"http:\/\/interbrand.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Interbrand<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>Built upon heritage-founded principles of confidence, determination, and uncompromising conviction, Juventus has crafted a revolutionary growth plan&#8211;launched during the inaugural &#8220;Black and White and More&#8221; event and sustained by a new brand strategy and identity. Juventus aims to distil its essence into far-reaching experiences which can appeal to the football fan while being highly relevant to entertainment enthusiasts who are further away from football as a sport. The new logo is iconic and universal. It&#8217;s bold enough to make a statement, but flexible enough to appear alongside a wide range of new experiences&#8211;in the stadium and beyond. By leaving the team&#8217;s defining black-and-white stripes untouched, Juventus is bringing the illustrious legacy and spirit of one of Italy&#8217;s preeminent teams to new audiences and die-hard fans alike.<br \/><br \/>The new identity launched in Milan on January 16, 2017, the first of many premier, immersive Juventus events. The new identity will then follow the team to showcase future digital, social, and retail experiences to loyal supporters, soccer enthusiasts, business partners, and entertainment enthusiasts. Juventus&#8217;s move is unprecedented&#8211;to become recognized for more than their performance on the field, but as a universal symbol for perseverance, ambition, and premium Italian style.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/interbrand.com\/work\/beyond-entertainment-beyond-lifestyle-juventus-is-an-identity\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Interbrand project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/s26jlK8bUSY\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo introduction.

Well, boo-hoo. Other than familiarity with it &#8212; and, I&#8217;ll admit, the historic perpetuation of the egg-shaped oval as the main recognition element &#8212; there was nothing amazing about the old logo and by now it looked more like an F1 brand than a traditional soccer shield\/crest\/badge. Fans and purists will disagree but the new logo is excellent, regardless or perhaps specifically for how it breaks from convention and tradition and dares to do something different for this specific category. Just look at the image directly below to see what a difference a contemporary logo makes seen in contrast to what looks like a display of antique plates cordoned off in a museum.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/juventus_other_logos_b.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Juventus by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Italian Serie A team logos, with old and new Juventus logos shown for comparison.

The monogram works great small, large, in black, in white, and can withstand weird stuff like the image below. The wordmark condensed and industrial-esque wordmark also hints at the uniform stripes and even in its simplicity it has plenty of personality, mostly thanks to the initial &#8220;J&#8221;.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/juventus_rough_logo.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Juventus by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Kanye-esque interpretation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/juventus_ball_net.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Juventus by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>One ball.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/juventus_balls.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Juventus by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Two balls.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/juventus_type_family.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Juventus by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Custom type family.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/juventus_type_animation.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Juventus by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Type family, animated.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The custom type family is quite nice and successfully executed across multiple weights.

To me, this is where the brand veers off in a bad direction, way more than whatever the logo fails to do for fans, as it takes away (or more like pisses on) the popular (as in of-the-people) appeal of soccer. But, I get it, flash and pomp has its own appeal. Overall, I absolutely like the new logo and commend both the team and Interbrand for pursuing and achieving a rare case of simplicity, boldness, and directness rarely seen in European soccer teams that will help expand the possibilities of how and where Juventus is presented without it being dragged back by what other 100-year-old soccer teams are expected to look like.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1897, Juventus F.C. &#8212; or Juventus, or Juve, or I Bianconeri (the black-and-white) &#8212; is a professional Italian football club based in Turin and, arguably, one of the most famous and successful teams in soccer history.
