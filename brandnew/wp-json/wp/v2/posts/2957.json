This month, Amue introduced a new identity designed by Lyon, France-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.grapheine.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Graph&eacute;ine<\/a>.

A noble effort in concept but awfully executed originally. The new version maintains the same construction but brings it into the twenty-first century with a not-so-pleasant version of the quotes with gradients &mdash; which is a shame because they look great without the gradients as seen in the image directly above &mdash; and a new custom typeface designed in collaboration with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nonpareille.net\/page\/amue-np\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nonpareil<\/a>. The color of the wordmark is a little strange, brownish gray, but it makes for a good, memorable wordmark with its own distinct aesthetic.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/amue_icon_set.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for AMUE by Graph&eacute;ine\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icon set.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/15AkB1g4rQo\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Video greeting card for the new year.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/amue_brand_architecture.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for AMUE by Graph&eacute;ine\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brand architecture.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/amue_type_regular.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for AMUE by Graph&eacute;ine\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/amue_type_small_caps.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for AMUE by Graph&eacute;ine\" \/>\n<figcaption>Custom typeface: Amue Regular and Small Caps by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nonpareille.net\/page\/amue-np\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nonpareil<\/a>.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The custom typeface has me on the fence. I like aspects of it and dislike others, but I think I&#8217;m won over by the small caps, which create a nice typographic texture and has some charming quirks to it.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/amue_catalog.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for AMUE by Graph&eacute;ine\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/amue_catalog_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for AMUE by Graph&eacute;ine\" \/>\n<figcaption>A couple catalogs.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/amue_materials.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for AMUE by Graph&eacute;ine\" \/>\n<figcaption>Various materials.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">In application there is also the gradient-y and plus-sign-y background that provides some welcome texture and works well with the bold typography. It looks like football play and formation diagrams but for nerds. I think that&#8217;s a compliment. Overall, it&#8217;s a vast upgrade to what Amue had before and it makes for a relatively creative identity within the academic world.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1992, Amue (short for Agence de mutualisation des universit&eacute;s et etablissements, which translates to &#8220;Agency sharing of universities and institutions&#8221;) is an organization devoted to fostering innovation among universities and other Higher Education and Research Institutions in France&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,29,26],"tags":[292,108,165,46],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2957"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2957"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2957\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2957"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2957"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2957"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
