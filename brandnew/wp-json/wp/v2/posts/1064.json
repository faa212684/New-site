I favor Starbucks coffee and de-favor eating donuts altogether (despite their awesome deliciousness) so I&#8217;m in a minority that doesn&#8217;t frequent Dunkin&#8217; Donuts &mdash; a minority that has become even smaller since 2002, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dunkindonuts.com\/aboutus\/press\/PressRelease.aspx?viewtype=archive&#038;id=58\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">when a steaming cup of coffee was added to the Dunkin&#8217; Donuts logo<\/a> to muscle back into consumers&#8217; consciousness that coffee wasn&#8217;t just available from Starbucks or McDonald&#8217;s. And, apparently, that change paid off as Dunkin&#8217; Donuts is celebrating its 60th anniversary (it was founded in 1950) with a new identity that not only removes the coffee cup but also reaches back to its vintage roots for inspiration.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/03_dunkin_donuts_vintage_insp.jpg\" alt=\"Dunkin' Donuts\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Vintage inspiration for the new identity.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/04_dunkin_donuts_dunkie_comp.jpg\" alt=\"Dunkin' Donuts\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><a href=\"http:\/\/largetype.squarespace.com\/blog\/2010\/3\/24\/dunkin-donuts-mascot-redesign.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">New Dunkie by Matt Stevens<\/a> on the right, along old Dunkie.<\/p>\n<p>At the center of the new identity is Dunkie, a coffee-cup-and-donut-shaped buddy that served as the brand&#8217;s mascot during the late 1950s and &rsquo;60s, even inspiring a Mr. Potato Head spin-off, <a href=\"http:\/\/goretro.blogspot.com\/2008\/06\/happy-national-doughnut-day.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dunkie Donut Head<\/a>. Charlotte, NC based <a href=\"http:\/\/largetype.squarespace.com\/blog\/2010\/3\/24\/dunkin-donuts-mascot-redesign.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Matt Stevens was approached by the creative director from Dunkin&#8217; Donuts in-house team to revisit Dunkie<\/a> and prepare him for the twenty-first century. Retaining all the elements from the old Dunkie, new Dunkie is a bold, animated new version eager to serve you fresh donuts and hot coffee as he leaps towards you.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/02_dunkin_donuts_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"Dunkin' Donuts\" \/><\/p>\n<p>More surprising than Dunkie replacing the cup of coffee in the logo is the old-but-new script typography that replaces the chunky, rounded typography that has become synonymous with Dunkin&#8217; Donuts. I&#8217;m a fan of vintage script typography, but I&#8217;m not sure this was the right move as the loss of visual impact is far less worthy than some blast from the past. Nonetheless, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dunkindonuts.com\/shoponline\/Product.aspx?CategoryId=MERCH&#038;GroupId=APP78\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">it does look great on a t-shirt<\/a> &mdash; and said t-shirt also brings back some vintage Dunkin&#8217;ana with the tag line &#8220;Time to Make Donuts&#8221; made popular by <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fred_the_Baker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fred the Baker<\/a>, who served as their spokesperson from 1982 to 1997.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/05_dunkin_donuts_60yr.gif\" alt=\"Dunkin' Donuts\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The in-house team took Steven&#8217;s Dunkie torso to revise their current 60th anniversary logo, which was fine but, now in tune, with the new identity is fare more interesting. The folks at Dunkin&#8217; Donuts have also been busy with some new packaging prototypes that include Dunkie and the new script, and it&#8217;s nice to see that the logo is not applied as the same lock-up over and over again.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/06_dunkin_donuts_box.jpg\" alt=\"Dunkin' Donuts\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/07_dunkin_donuts_cups.jpg\" alt=\"Dunkin' Donuts\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/08_dunkin_donuts_mug.jpg\" alt=\"Dunkin' Donuts\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">New packaging.<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, some rather cool merchandise has been created with the new look and I have to say that, unlike its golden-arched competitor, I&#8217;m Lovin&#8217;
