Since 1993, the tournament hosts 10 cities from the continent and 2 invited teams from other countries (like Mexico, Canada, or the U.S.). Next year, the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.conmebol.com\/es\/content\/el-torneo-continental-mas-antiguo-del-mundo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tournament will be played in Chile<\/a> and the identity has been designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.brandiacentral.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brandia Central<\/a> (who have developed an interesting niche in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.brandiacentral.com\/uk\/category\/work\/sectors\/sports-entertainment\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sports events identities<\/a> like this).<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>The strategic work culminated on a strong recommendation: this edition of COPA Am&eacute;rica would be the start of something new, being the first with a &#8220;host-inspired brand&#8221;. Instead of presenting an &#8220;institutional-based brand&#8221; (focusing on COPA America&#8217;s tournament), like the previous ones, this edition&#8217;s brand would present Chile as proud host, showing its influence on the brand visuals.<\/blockquote><h3>Provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/copa_america_2015_previous_logos.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Copa Am&eacute;rica by Brandia Central\" \/>\n<figcaption>Previous logos, all following the same format.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/copa_america_2015_sources.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Copa Am&eacute;rica by Brandia Central\" \/>\n<figcaption>Imagery sources and references.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The Chilean culture was the background for all the creative process: the 5-point star of the national flag, the 8-point star as an old national symbol as well as a reminder of the 8 host cities, the kultrun (ancient tribal drum) design, the human visual representations from folk culture representing 4 values: Celebration, Passion, Surpass and Triumph. In other words,\u00a0 a fan (or &#8220;hincha&#8221;, in spanish), a heart, two contenders and the most beautiful football move of all &mdash; the bicycle kick, aka &#8220;Chilena&#8221; (Chilean).\u00a0\nAll of these elements were then revisited through a modern visual approach. Portraying a modern, ambitious and cheerful country.<\/blockquote><h3>Provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/copa_america_2015_logo_explanation.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Copa Am&eacute;rica by Brandia Central\" \/>\n<figcaption>Elements.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/copa_america_2015_logo_colors.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Copa Am&eacute;rica by Brandia Central\" \/>\n<figcaption>Color options.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/copa_america_2015_logo_with_tagline.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Copa Am&eacute;rica by Brandia Central\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo with tagline.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>While it was nice to have consistency throughout the previous tournaments with some kind of flag-leading-to-a-ball structure, all those logos are forgettable and uninspiring. Now, like the FIFA World Cup and other large-scale sports with a lot of wait time in between its editions, the Copa Am&eacute;rica has a host-specific identity with more flavor, relevance, and potential engagement.<\/p>\n<p>The new logo has plenty of elements and references &mdash; perhaps too many &mdash; and is rendered in Brandia Central&#8217;s signature gradient style. It makes for an intriguing symbol that invites further exploration. I could have done without the four player icons in the logo but if the premise is more-is-more (which it seems to be) then it works. The &#8220;Copa Am&eacute;rica&#8221; typography is fine and unassuming while the &#8220;Chile 2015&#8221; demands all the attention. There is some disconnect between the hard angles of the icon and the overly scripty typography. In application, though, it&#8217;s clear that there is a maximalist approach that promotes the combination of all kinds of visuals.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/copa_america_2015_icons.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Copa Am&eacute;rica by Brandia Central\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icons.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>I love the icon set, particularly the &#8220;chilena&#8221; (far right). Not sure about the second one, with the two players bumping crotches.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/copa_america_2015_logo_sede.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Copa Am&eacute;rica by Brandia Central\" \/>\n<figcaption>Host city logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/copa_america_2015_logo_sede_stuff.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Copa Am&eacute;rica by Brandia Central\" \/>\n<figcaption>Host city elements.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The identity starts getting far too diverse here, with the introduction of this type style that feels overly trendy, not in the right way.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/copa_america_2015_logo_full_of_stuff.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Copa Am&eacute;rica by Brandia Central\" \/>\n<figcaption>Bringing it all together.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/copa_america_2015_logo_sede_stuff_more.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Copa Am&eacute;rica by Brandia Central\" \/>\n<figcaption>And again, with more stuff.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/90759638?portrait=0&amp;color=ffffff\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Brand video.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">As a whole, with all the diverse and seemingly disparate elements, the identity comes together quite energetically and there is an overall great texture to the work even if at times you are left scratching your head of why there is so much stuff. More importantly, this identity provides a solid springboard for future tournament identities.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"First played in 1916, COPA Am&eacute;rica (American Cup) is the oldest international soccer competition, played every four years in a different South American country from team members of CONMEBOL, the continental governing body of association football in South America.
