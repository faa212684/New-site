Offering 91 total language courses for more than 30 distinct languages online as well as in Android and iOS apps, Duolingo has 300 million users worldwide. A big part of its appeal is that it&#8217;s built to feel like a game, allowing users to compete with friends, earning points, leveling up, and earning virtual currency, all in bite-sized lessons that are easy to get through. We have covered Duolingo twice: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/new_logo_for_duolingo_done_in-house.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">in 2013<\/a> when they first redesigned their owl from creepy-robotic to fun-cartoon-y and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/new_logo_for_duolingo_done_in_house.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">in January of this year<\/a> when they kept the cartoon-y approach but flattened the angle and created a cohesive set of illustrations. Recently, Duolingo introduced a new wordmark and a more formalized visual language designed by London, UK-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonbanks.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Johnson Banks<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>Visually, their owl mascot (Duo), the core colour, and their illustration style were broadly working. But they lacked clear guidelines on how to use the brand &#8216;away&#8217; from the app environment. A growing list of projects and initiatives &#8211; such as their ground-breaking online English test &#8211; were also pushing at the boundaries of the brand structure.<br \/><br \/>As we experimented with juxtaposing the mascot with their name, a <em>&#8216;what if?&#8217;<\/em> unlocked the solution. Instead of using neutral typography alongside the symbol (like every other tech company), we redrew the logotype drawing inspiration from Duo&#8217;s feathery form to reflect the company&#8217;s quirky personality.<br \/><br \/>Our initial attempts to do this looked odd. But bit-by-bit we began to solve the logo conundrum, and started planning a bespoke typeface. With the help of typography specialists Fontsmith, we fine-tuned the logotype and then extrapolated the idea out into more characters. [&hellip;] Little quirks, such as the flick of the lowercase &#8216;g&#8217; were used sparingly, beta versions were crash-tested and eventually &#8216;Feather Bold&#8217; was ready.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonbanks.co.uk\/work\/duolingo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Johnson Banks project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/duolingo_jb_owl_font_relationship.png\" alt=\"New Wordmark and Identity for Duolingo by Johnson Banks\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/duolingo_jb_owl_font_relationship_02.png\" alt=\"New Wordmark and Identity for Duolingo by Johnson Banks\" \/>\n<figcaption>Elements from &#8220;Duo&#8221; that influenced the wordmark and font.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/duolingo_jb_wordmark_details.png\" alt=\"New Wordmark and Identity for Duolingo by Johnson Banks\" \/>\n<figcaption>Wordmark highlights.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/duolingo_jb_wordmark.png\" alt=\"New Wordmark and Identity for Duolingo by Johnson Banks\" \/>\n<figcaption>Wordmark.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The previous wordmark was not very good even though it had a simple geometric sans structure&#8230; the &#8220;l&#8221; and the &#8220;g&#8221; were badly executed and oddly disproportionate and the squat ascenders yet long descender of the &#8220;g&#8221; made it very awkward. The new wordmark strays from the generic sans trend with a charming, bold, and quirky custom approach that matches the playfulness of the owl mascot in spirit while taking a few visual cues from it in execution. The &#8220;g&#8221; in particular sets the tone, being the most &#8220;interpretative&#8221; letterform, taking some liberties and perhaps even risks &#8212; my money is on at least 10 comments below being &#8220;duolin8o&#8221; &#8212; but it&#8217;s fun and memorable. The slightly exaggerated round corners and the long tapers on the curves of the stems are nicely executed. It&#8217;s a great evolution that builds on the unique personality of the brand.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/duolingo_jb_font.png\" alt=\"New Wordmark and Identity for Duolingo by Johnson Banks\" \/>\n<figcaption>&#8220;Feather Bold&#8221; custom typeface, designed in collaboration with Fontsmith<\/a>.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/duolingo_jb_font_baselines.png\" alt=\"New Wordmark and Identity for Duolingo by Johnson Banks\" \/>\n<figcaption>Baseline, x-height, and other horizontal lines.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/duolingo_jb_font_samples.png\" alt=\"New Wordmark and Identity for Duolingo by Johnson Banks\" \/>\n<figcaption>Type usage.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The expanded typeface is great.
