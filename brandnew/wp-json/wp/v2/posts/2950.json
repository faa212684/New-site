The identity, designed by local designer <a href=\"http:\/\/www.behance.net\/samirarahimi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Samira Rahimi<\/a>, at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.iconologic.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Iconologic<\/a>, revolved around a wonderful and dense illustration with enough feel-good vibes to win over even the hatiest of haters. The texture of the illustration looks great when used as a background and the groups of icons sometimes pulled on their own and blown up also reveal a delightful watercolor texture. The logo itself is nothing too exciting but, in color and shape, helps offset the illustration. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/Peoples-Food-Truck\/10455985\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Annie Hall by Marina Soto<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_anniehall.jpg\" alt=\"Annie Hall by Marina Soto\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">Part of the Club de Tennis Figueres in the province of Girona, Annie Hall is a restaurant whose theme lacks no subtlety despite being one of the most subtle and non-confrontational identities I think we&#8217;ve ever shown on Friday Likes. But just in case: the themes are tennis and Woody Allen&#8217;s <em>Annie Hall<\/em> (and the meeting place of the titular character and director). From the latter, Barcelona-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.marinasoto.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Marina Soto<\/a> used an impressively more handsome take on <a href=\"http:\/\/kitblog.com\/2007\/12\/woody_allens_typography.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Allen&#8217;s favorite font, Windsor<\/a>. I don&#8217;t know what font it is, but it is rather nice. And from the former, Marina translated the straightforward grids of the tennis court into the menus. Again, this is not a whiz-bang identity but its subtlety and sophistication are perfect for an upscale tennis club&#8217;s restaurant. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.marinasoto.com\/Annie-Hall\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Kigo Kitchen by Creature<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_kigo.jpg\" alt=\"Kigo Kitchen by Creature\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">For the record: I swear that I am not trying to make <a href=\"http:\/\/welcometocreature.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Creature<\/a> happen, nor am I in their payroll to promote them, nor is it a campaign to increase &#8220;appreciations&#8221; on Clara Mulligan&#8217;s Behance posts. It just happened that last Friday I stumbled on her Nails for America project, then this week we featured Creature&#8217;s own identity, and last night I stumbled upon this identity through a separate stream. When I saw that it was done by Creature I just thought, &#8220;Oh, jeez, not these people again.&#8221; Anyway&hellip; Kigo Kitchen is a Pan-Asian, quick-fire lunch and dinner restaurant with two locations, Boston and Seattle. All that I praised about Annie Hall above, this deserves the diametrically opposite kind of praise. The identity is loud, vibrant, frenetic, and non-stop with a lot of different visual elements in play from the hand-drawn logo to the curved typography to the banner-like holding devices to iconography and more. It all comes together with amazing energy and flavor. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/Kigo-Kitchen\/13532809\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Today we have a restaurant-themed set of Friday Likes that range from a food truck to an upscale tennis club restaurant to a quick-service restaurant with work from Atlanta, Barcelona, and Seattle&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[564],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2950"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2950"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2950\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2950"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2950"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2950"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
