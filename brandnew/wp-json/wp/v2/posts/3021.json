Its small fleet of 26 airplanes is well known in the airline industry for having &#8220;one of the most enviable safety records in Canada&#8221; despite the &#8220;challenging and often hostile conditions&#8221; under which it operates. The new identity and livery, introduced a year ago &mdash; flying under the radar of Brand New at the time &mdash; were designed by Montreal-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.studiofeed.ca\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FEED<\/a> in collaboration with brand consultant <a href=\"http:\/\/machaput.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Marc-Andr&eacute; Chaput<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"red_100\">Update:<\/span> A couple of images (envelope detail and cabin interior) added.<\/strong><\/p><!--more--><blockquote>The rebranding of Air Inuit may come as a surprise to some (since the carrier has few or no direct competitors to speak of), but it is part of a company-wide modernization initiative designed to help Air Inuit meet increased demand for air transport services due to the growing number of infrastructure and mining projects in the resource-rich province.<\/blockquote><h3>Provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/air_inuit_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Livery for Air Inuit by FEED\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/air_inuit_identity_press.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Livery for Air Inuit by FEED\" \/>\n<figcaption>Identity values for print.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The orange-and-white goose design was created to reflect the Inuit&#8217;s love and respect of nature and the abundant wildlife that have allowed its people to survive for thousands of years in one of the planet&#8217;s harshest environments. It was also intended to underscore the company&#8217;s distinctive corporate culture and bold new vision for the future which includes improving efficiency to cope with rising operating costs, the addition of new routes and specialized services, and a careful expansion into new markets.<\/blockquote><h3>Provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/air_inuit_illustration.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Livery for Air Inuit by FEED\" \/>\n<figcaption>Goose illustration.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>In addition to a bold new logo and livery design, Feed also created an exclusive typeface in collaboration with French typeface designer Jean-Baptiste Lev&eacute;e to give the distinctive written language a strong, yet carefully crafted feel that steers clear of clich\u00e9s, reflects the company&#8217;s specialized expertise and spirit of innovation, and works across cultures and languages. Appropriately named Air Inuit Sans, the corporate font is one of a handful of typefaces in the world used to write the Inuktitut language, and certainly one of the first specifically designed to give roman glyphs and their syllabic equivalent a look and feel that is common to both. The same typeface was used to create the company&#8217;s new logotype that features the word &#8220;Inuit&#8221; in traditional syllabics in orange to highlight the company&#8217;s Inuit ownership and cultural heritage.<\/blockquote><h3>Provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/air_inuit_type_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Livery for Air Inuit by FEED\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/air_inuit_type_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Livery for Air Inuit by FEED\" \/>\n<figcaption>Air Inuit Sans by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jblt.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jean-Baptiste Lev&eacute;e<\/a>.

It&#8217;s as straightforward as wordmarks get &mdash; except for the part that half of this wordmark is set in the Inuktitut language (making it interesting simply because the two languages are perfectly in visual synch). Even in application the logo is barely noticeable and the custom sans serif barely registers as anything out of the ordinary. Strangely enough, this is actually praise. The quiet and subtle integration of the local language is more than enough peculiarity to the project and is a commendable effort in itself. Even better is the fact that this subtle typography is accompanied by a stunning piece of illustration that single-handedly turns this identity and livery into a fantastically restrained and sophisticated brand where there was none before.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/air_inuit_stationery.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Livery for Air Inuit by FEED\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stationery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/air_inuit_envelope.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Livery for Air Inuit by FEED\" \/>\n<figcaption>Envelope detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/air_inuit_boarding_pass.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Livery for Air Inuit by FEED\" \/>\n<figcaption>Boarding pass and lanyard.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/air_inuit_livery_before_after.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Livery for Air Inuit by FEED\" \/>\n<figcaption>Livery, before and after.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>A homage to a generations-old tradition of Inuit arts and crafts, the fuselage was used as an artist&#8217;s canvas to allow the dovetailing Canada geese to fully spread their wings so they could be seen from a distance and contrast with the snowy landscape.<\/blockquote><h3>Provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/air_inuit_livery_tail.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Livery for Air Inuit by FEED\" \/>\n<figcaption>Livery tail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/air_inuit_livery_on_ice.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Livery for Air Inuit by FEED\" \/>\n<figcaption>Livery, on ice!<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/air_inuit_livery_painting.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Livery for Air Inuit by FEED\" \/>\n<figcaption>Painting the new livery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/air_inuit_livery_all.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Livery for Air Inuit by FEED\" \/>\n<figcaption>The full fleet.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/air_inuit_cabin.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Livery for Air Inuit by FEED\" \/>\n<figcaption>Cabin interior.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/air_inuit_uniform.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Livery for Air Inuit by FEED\" \/>\n<figcaption>Uniform<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/air_inuit_flag.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Livery for Air Inuit by FEED\" \/>\n<figcaption>Flag.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Despite a minimal range of execution variations the identity feels fresh and lively.
