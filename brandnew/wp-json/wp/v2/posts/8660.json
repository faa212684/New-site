The theater&#8217;s main hall seats 450 people while a smaller one seats 150 and in addition there are multiple multi-purpose rooms that are accessible to other organizations. The building opened in September of last year &#8212; after a process that began in 2011 with a call for architecture proposals &#8212; and introduced a new identity designed by Ghent, Belgium-based <a href=\"https:\/\/dift.be\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DIFT<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>Our concept brought together several layers, starting with the idea that a new centre is a blank page. That&#8217;s why we choose to start off with a grid on which everyone could make their own branding of Leietheater.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/dift.be\/en\/projects\/leietheater\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DIFT project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/leietheater_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Leietheater by DIFT\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo. The tagline reads &#8220;Together we make art&#8221;.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The logo on its own and in its primary configuration (above) is not much to look at or get excited by but it&#8217;s a very good foundation for the flexibility and playfulness it has in application. Part of what makes the logo and its flexibility work is how neatly the capital &#8220;L&#8221; and capital &#8220;T&#8221; fall in the corners of the expandable grid element, framing whatever appears within it and allowing the two words to snap to any of the four corners. When the logo is on its own, the tagline sits quite well in what otherwise would be very awkward empty space. So it&#8217;s not super exciting but it&#8217;s certainly effective.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/leietheater_logo_flexibility.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo flexibility.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/leietheater_logo_bumper.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo with shapes that &#8220;refer to the architecture and surroundings of the building&#8221;.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/leietheater_brochure_blank.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Leietheater by DIFT\" \/>\n<figcaption>2019 &#8211; 20 season brochure, blank.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/leietheater_brochure_stickers.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Leietheater by DIFT\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brochure, sticker sheet.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/leietheater_brochure_cover.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Leietheater by DIFT\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/leietheater_brochure_cover_various.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Leietheater by DIFT\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brochure, adorned.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>What got my attention about the project were these funky shapes and how they are freely applied in weird ways. The only literal shape is the wide orange step-like figure that reflects the silhouette of the new building but other than that, the rest are squiggles, egg-shaped thingies, and flat boomerang-like bits and pieces. They are meant to refer the &#8220;surroundings of the building&#8221; but I gladly also accept that they are simply fun. The shapes come alive in the season brochure that comes with a sheet of stickers that allows patrons to customize their own covers. It&#8217;s charming and it sends a subtle, romantic and philosophical message that this new center is for them.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/leietheater_icon_set.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Leietheater by DIFT\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icon set.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/leietheater_icon_set_brochure.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Leietheater by DIFT\" \/>\n<figcaption>Some of the icons in action in the brochure.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The shapes also come together into icons for each of the event categories and while they are not perfect they make up for it in personality.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/leietheater_website.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Leietheater by DIFT\" \/>\n<figcaption>Website.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>[We] asked Deinze&#8217;s citizens to play with these shapes &#8211; be it on a human scale.
