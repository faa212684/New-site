It was founded by NFL Wide Receiver Larry Fitzgerald of the Arizona Cardinals in partnership with David Jones, who previously worked at luxury travel company Ker &amp; Downey. While they offer service to many places in the world, they specialize in Egypt, Greece, Italy, South Africa, and Peru. The identity for Nomad Hill was designed by Boulder, CO-based <a href=\"http:\/\/andrewlittmann.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Andrew Littmann<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>The name, &#8216;Nomad Hill&#8217; came from that idea that many travelers today, both young and old, are often drawn to this idea of being a &#8220;nomad.&#8221; Its an adventurous moniker, a romantic idea that one could always be traveling, always seeing something new; never old or boring. And a hill is most commonly a place of perspective. Travelers seek new ideas and new perspectives on life &#8211; they seek the confluence of cultures, global education, immersion and transformation.  And so the name represents the adventurous spirit encapsulated in these two words together, having the added benefit of sounding almost like a proper noun, which helps it to be easily remembered.<br \/><br \/>The mark is the visual foundation of the Nomad Hill identity. It was created to be a direct representation of the Nomad Hill name;  a series of meandering, &#8216;nomadic&#8217; lines across the face of a hill.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/andrewlittmann.com\/work\/nomad-hill\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Andrew Littmann project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nomad_hill_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Nomad Hill by Andrew Littmann\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nomad_hill_icon_construction_2.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Nomad Hill by Andrew Littmann\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icon underlying grid.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>I realize the company isn&#8217;t quite &#8220;Reviewed&#8221; material being that it&#8217;s relatively small and fairly niche but I was quite smitten by the icon, in part because we don&#8217;t see many graphic icons anymore; almost everything is some kind of monogram, which are fine and good, but it&#8217;s nice to see someone designing something pictorial that pays off of the name. The protruding hill icon has a nice silhouette to it that &#8212; again, going against modern-day conventions &#8212; doesn&#8217;t form a square or a circle and inside features a set of asymmetric lines that give it motion and fluidity. I didn&#8217;t quite read the lines as paths in the hill but I&#8217;ll happily buy in on that concept. The size relationship with the wordmark is key to making the icon look tall and I also appreciate the same thickness of it reflected in the wordmark.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nomad_hill_patterns_01.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Nomad Hill by Andrew Littmann\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nomad_hill_patterns_02.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Nomad Hill by Andrew Littmann\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nomad_hill_patterns_03.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Nomad Hill by Andrew Littmann\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nomad_hill_patterns_04.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Nomad Hill by Andrew Littmann\" \/>\n<figcaption>Patterns.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nomad_hill_materials.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Nomad Hill by Andrew Littmann\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nomad_hill_materials_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Nomad Hill by Andrew Littmann\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nomad_hill_materials_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Nomad Hill by Andrew Littmann\" \/>\n<figcaption>Various materials.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">The identity is spruced up with a set of patterns that can be arranged in city-like or abstract grid configurations that are&#8230; well, they are fairly gratuitous concept-wise but are fun to look at. I wish they had a better visual relationship with the icon somehow but, again, they are pleasing. The applications look crisp and help give the company a vibrant, youthful vibe that&#8217;s not stuffy like other high-end travel organizers while also avoiding looking like a run-of-the-mill tour operator.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 2016, Nomad Hill is a travel company based in Houston, TX, that helps customers by handcrafting itineraries and experiences around the world not just by booking hotels and tours but by customizing each trip for the traveler.
