A number of announcements:<\/p>\n<h6>New website<\/h6>\n<p>When we first did the event in New York in 2018, I put a one-page website together fairly quickly, not thinking too far ahead and with the premise that it was a one-time event so the website was not really built to accommodate past event archives or provide good information for upcoming events. That has all been addressed in <a href=\"https:\/\/underconsideration.com\/firstround\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a new proper website<\/a> in WordPress that makes it much easier to manage each event at its different stages for us and to browse for you.<\/p>\n<h6>New York Speakers Announced<\/h6>\n<p>Speakers for the New York edition on May 8 <a href=\"https:\/\/underconsideration.com\/firstround\/event\/2020-new-york\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">have been announced<\/a>. Early-bird registration will end on March 27. While this is a bigger venue (where we have held the Brand New Conference before) we expect &#8212; cautiously and optimistically &#8212; to sell out, so don&#8217;t sleep on <a href=\"https:\/\/underconsideration.com\/firstround\/register\/2020-new-york\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">getting tickets<\/a>!<\/p>\n<h6>We are coming to Europe!<\/h6>\n<p>Based on expressed interest we are taking a fun &#8212; hopefully &#8212; risk this year by bringing First Round to Europe in early June. We will be hitting <a href=\"https:\/\/underconsideration.com\/firstround\/event\/2020-london\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">London<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/underconsideration.com\/firstround\/event\/2020-berlin\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Berlin<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/underconsideration.com\/firstround\/event\/2020-barcelona\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Barcelona<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/underconsideration.com\/firstround\/event\/2020-madrid\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Madrid<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/underconsideration.com\/firstround\/event\/2020-amsterdam\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amsterdam<\/a> all in a span of two weeks. We have registered in the four countries and are ready to issue invoices to our VAT-loving audience.<\/p>\n<p>A few notes about the European tour:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The venues are on the small side, 300 to 400 people, as a way for us to be able to finance this. So, if things go well &#8212; fingers crossed &#8212;\u00a0they&#8217;ll sell out quickly.<\/li>\n<li>Both Madrid and Barcelona, the presentations will ALL be in Spanish.<\/li>\n<li>Both Amsterdam and Berlin, the presentations will ALL be in English. Additionally for these two cities, there will be 6 local speakers and 6 international speakers. (First Round speakers are always local in all other cities.)<\/li>\n<li>If you are on that side of the world: come! It&#8217;s a huge effort to do events in Europe and we would love to keep doing them, so, yeah, come : )<\/li>\n<li><strong>Speakers will be announced on March 9, but you can get cheaper tickets now in pre-sale.<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h6>A few other things<\/h6>\n<p>We now have a dedicated account for @FirstRoundUC on both <a href=\"https:\/\/instagram.com\/FirstRoundUC\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Instagram<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/FirstRoundUC\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Facebook<\/a> and there is also a proper <a href=\"https:\/\/underconsideration.com\/firstround\/mailing-list\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mailing list<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p class=\"end\">That&#8217;s it!
