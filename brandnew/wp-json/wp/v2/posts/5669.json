When I first saw this project, by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pop-pac.com\/#\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pop &amp; Pac<\/a>, I thought it was by an over-ambitious student because there is no way any client &#8212; even an independent burger place &#8212; would adopt this design much less produce it. Even after I looked at Huxtaburger&#8217;s site, I kept thinking &#8220;Nah&#8230; no way&#8221; but after checking <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/huxtaburger\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">their Instagram account<\/a> I could confirm that, yes way. It&#8217;s not that it&#8217;s the most amazing or groundbreaking design ever but it&#8217;s pretty wild design-wise and not easy production-wise, since everything is full bleed. The torn-paper-like illustrations are perfectly done, in a great color palette, and the hidden little human figures throughout are awesome. The condensed, loosely letter-spaced sans serif logo is a great complement and the burgers inside the packaging don&#8217;t look half-bad either. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/54913291\/Huxtaburger\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">FIRM by Mirror Mirror<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_firmclinic.jpg\" alt=\"Firm by Mirror Mirror\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/firm-clinic.be\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FIRM<\/a> is a cosmetic clinic in Antwerp, Belgium, offering aesthetic treatments for body and face. Their former name was Medipolis Beauty Clinic, which is not very lifestyle-ish, and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.medipolis.be\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">their identity<\/a> wasn&#8217;t exactly reaf<em>firm<\/em>ing. The new name, logo, and identity, by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mirrormirror.be\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mirror Mirror<\/a> positions the clinic to be upscale, fashionable, and on top of its game. The logo is a non-surprising disappearing-thin-line-stencil serif that we&#8217;ve seen a dozen times but the identity is top-notch&#8230; literally, with a curvy pair of notches on pretty much every application that don&#8217;t just look pretty but also subtly hint at the nip-and-tuck techniques. If that sounds icky, then let your mind rest on the beautiful and calming colored papers chosen for the print materials. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mirrormirror.be\/home\/firm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">BEAT360 by ContentFormContext<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_beat360.gif\" alt=\"BEAT360 by ContentFormContext\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/beat360.kia.com\/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BEAT360<\/a> is a brand experience space in Seoul, South Korea, for KIA where you can see their cars, have some coffee, and ogle at the intricate space. The identity, by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.contentformcontext.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ContentFormContext<\/a>, translates the name into a typographic treatment with a literal beat in motion and a smartly implemented strategy in physical materials where the &#8220;beat&#8221; can be represented in different stages. The no-expenses-spared experience allows the production of all the materials to be crisp and elegant and applied everywhere from stationery to glass without, well, missing a beat. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.contentformcontext.com\/BEAT360\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Some playful yet understated projects this week, with work from Melbourne, Antwerp, and Seoul&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[59,11,75,85,26],"tags":[253,694,617,1275,498,807,33,437],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5669"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=5669"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5669\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=5669"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=5669"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=5669"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
