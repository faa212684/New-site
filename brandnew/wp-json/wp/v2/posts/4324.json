The identity is a collection of broken bits and pieces that make the individual applications seem random on their own but, as a whole, the elements create a consistent, abstract visual language. There is no broad narrative story to tell nor concept to specifically sell other than &#8220;we can design cool stuff&#8221; &mdash; which they do, if you look at their projects and, to boot, the projects fit the aesthetic of their identity. The applications are like professional-level design exercises of shape and form and they are a joy to see. The bold serif wordmark provides a great contrast to the spare layouts and geometric objects. <a href=\"http:\/\/studiobruch.com\/bruch\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Union Hand-Roasted Coffee by Studio Output<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_unioncoffee.jpg\" alt=\"Union Hand-Roasted Coffee by Studio Output\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.unionroasted.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Union Hand-Roasted Coffee<\/a> is an East London coffee roaster selling their batches directly to delis, coffee bars, and restaurants or providing them to catering services. One thing they understand besides coffee is good design, as their <a href=\"http:\/\/www.graphicology.com\/blog\/2008\/1\/10\/141-union-hand-roasted-packaging.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">previous packaging was pretty good<\/a> but perhaps a little dark and clinical. The new look by London-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.studio-output.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Studio Output<\/a> is much softer and coffee-er. The element I like the most is the &#8220;u&#8221; with a coffee cup handle and also its monogram version where the underline of the wordmark becomes a tiny plate. It&#8217;s cute, smart, and still looks like it means business. The new packaging is all about the combination of materials and layering that assemble into a nicely crafted piece. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.studio-output.com\/case_study\/union\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Motiv Studio by Negation Studio<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_motiv.jpg\" alt=\"Motiv Studio by Negation Studio\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/motiv-studio.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Motiv Studio<\/a> is a 3D architectural visualization company based in Gdansk, Poland, and Negation Studio, based in neighboring Gdynia, designed a logo that&#8217;s a 2D visualization of a 3D idea. The &#8220;M&#8221; monogram is a great, energetic drawing that wraps a ribbon in and around a hexagon achieving depth in 2D in a simple, elegant way. It&#8217;s a really great mark. What attracted me to this project in the first place was that it&#8217;s literally a shiny object (and full of other shiny objects). Reproduced in copper ink with copper edging on the business cards and photographed on top of copper plumbing, this was too hard to ignore. I&#8217;m not convinced the sans serif typeface works to use it on everything across all materials as there is no point of contrast with the logo but, still, copper. <strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.negationstudio.com\/work\/446\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/strong><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"A lot of pretty, spare, and nicely produced identities this week, with work from Graz, London, and Gdynia&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[491,597,1074],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4324"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4324"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4324\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4324"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4324"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4324"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
