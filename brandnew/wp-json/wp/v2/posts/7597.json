Additionally, its mission is to &#8220;popularize the fundamental principles and values \u200b\u200bof the Olympic movement and sports among young people and the younger generation&#8221; with the goal to &#8220;form a wide active community of fans and athletes under the single national brand &#8216;Team of Russia&#8217;.&#8221; Earlier this month, Team Russia introduced two mascots, designed by Moscow-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.artlebedev.ru\/roc\/mascots\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Art.

They were designed by the Art. Lebedev Studio. The mascots have embodied the traditional ideas about Russian character and bravery, the adorable and amusing features of animals loved all over Russia, as well as an innovative image and design.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/olympic.ru\/en\/news\/meeting_roc\/roc-unveiled-the-mascots-of-team-russia-and-reached-out-to-fans-to-vote-on-their-names\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Russian Olympic Committee press release<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/team_russia_mascots_references_a.jpg\" alt=\"New Mascots for Team Russia by Art.

There is no rational reason something like it should exist, much less represent a nation&#8217;s group of athletes, but here it is, loose tying strings and all.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/team_russia_mascots_detail_bear.jpg\" alt=\"New Mascots for Team Russia by Art.

Its fuzzy, furry white snout graphic representation and small eyes make it super endearing.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/team_russia_mascots_cat.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Cat is a hat.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/team_russia_mascots_bear.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Bear tumbles to and fro.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/team_russia_mascots_cat_running.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Cat can run.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>I&#8217;m dying.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/team_russia_mascots_bear_hockey.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Bear can multiply and play hockey.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/team_russia_mascots_bear_icons.jpg\" alt=\"New Mascots for Team Russia by Art.
