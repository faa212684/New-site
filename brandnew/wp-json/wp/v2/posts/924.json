Now, eight years after the events of 2001, the name has changed to the simpler and more colloquial 9\/11 Memorial. And the museum will be known as the 9\/11 Memorial Museum, while National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum at the World Trade Center remains as the legal name of the non-profit organization. Coinciding with the opening of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.national911memorial.org\/site\/PageServer?pagename=New_Visit_Preview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">9\/11 Memorial Preview Site<\/a> &mdash; a space devoted to showcasing the plans and progress of the memorial and museum, as well as serving to collect stories and artifacts for future preservation &mdash; comes the release of a new identity in the long road of this venture in preparation for its opening in 2011. The identity has been designed by Landor in New York.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/9-11_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"9\/11 Memorial\" \/><\/p>\n<blockquote>In an effort to make the memorial distinctive and accessible to the general public, the name was shortened to &#8220;9\/11 Memorial.&#8221; With the name change came the need to create a new visual identity that reinforced the spirit of rebuilding. The new visual icon is built upon two pillars of strength and solidarity. The simplistic use of the date, 9\/11, with the &#8217;11&#8217; standing alone in a subdued blue against the black &#8216;9&#8217; and &#8216;Memoria&#8217;, the icon allows the gravity and authenticity of the events that occurred on 9\/11 to speak for themselves.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.landor.com\/index.cfm?do=news.pressrelease&#038;r=&#038;storyid=736&#038;bhcp=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Landor Press Release<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/9-11_concept_images_01.jpg\" alt=\"9\/11 Memorial\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/9-11_concept_images_02.jpg\" alt=\"9\/11 Memorial\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Concept applications of the identity.<\/p>\n<p>This is not an easy identity job, because you want to acknowledge the missing buildings without making it feel too much of a miserable reminder. The previous logo, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/a_new_voice_for_the_world_trad.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">which we covered back in 2007<\/a>, achieved that through the soft depiction of the buildings&#8217; footprints. This one, as a more public-facing identity achieves a good balance between simplicity and something that works to brand a public environment. The execution &mdash; set in Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones&#8217; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.typography.com\/fonts\/font_overview.php?productLineID=100009\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Verlag<\/a> &mdash; is simple and bold, without much visual fanfare other then the two bright blue ones standing in for the towers. It&#8217;s not a revolutionary idea but it perfectly serves the purpose here. And it serves for a solid structure for the rest of the applications.
