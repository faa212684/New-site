The company was established up with the name of Alisarda on 29 March 1963, with the aim of promoting tourism to Sardinia. In 1991 the name was changed to Meridiana. Following a merger with charter carrier Eurofly and the acquisition of the charter company Air Italy the airline became the most important Italian player in international leisure flights. In December 2017 growth towards new domestic, medium-haul and long haul destinations from Milan Malpensa was announced reflecting a major strategic shift for the Company. In February 2018 a new corporate identity was presented and the Company was rebranded as Air Italy.&#8221;<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/air_italy_old_logos.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Livery for Air Italy\" \/>\n<figcaption>Old (bottom) and older (top) logos used in the previous incarnation of Air Italy.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/air_italy_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Livery for Air Italy\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.
