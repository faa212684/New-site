Created by two friends who met at business school, Cristina Blankfein and Jennifer Ross, as a response to sugar-laden cocktails, Be Mixed has just been renamed Swoon Mixers and rolled into the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tasteswoon.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Swoon<\/a> brand, a sugar substitute syrup that has zero sugar and no chemicals, also created by the two friends and launched in 2019. Swoon Mixers come in flavors like Cucumber Mint, Margarita, and Ginger Lime, that can be mixed across a variety of spirits including vodka, rum, tequila, gin, whiskey, and wine. Re-launched last month, the new packaging was designed in-house at Swoon, with support from <a href=\"http:\/\/hello.center.design\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Center<\/a>. The Swoon logo was originally designed by Brooklyn, NY-based <a href=\"https:\/\/redantler.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Red Antler<\/a>, and the Swoon <em>Mixers<\/em> logo by <a href=\"http:\/\/hello.center.design\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Center<\/a> (both designed at each firm by <a href=\"https:\/\/andygallows.com\/swoon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Andrew Galloway<\/a>).<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/swoon_mixers_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Swoon Mixers done In-House in collaboration with CENTER\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/swoon_mixers_logo_swoon_only.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Swoon Mixers done In-House in collaboration with CENTER\" \/>\n<figcaption>Swoon-only logo, to appreciate it.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo had a decent idea and execution in the &#8220;MIXED&#8221; part of the logo but the lowercase, italic &#8220;be&#8221; killed the vibe &#8212; not sure why they didn&#8217;t just keep it in the same approach, even if it was smaller and centered above but the mixing and matching of type styles was too much, even for a mixer. The new logo is great in part because the original Swoon logo is extra delicious with so many curves that it makes <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=lombard+street+san+francisco&#038;safe=active&#038;sxsrf=ALeKk01gjHfiYklH5m08ABQ3lrQdQG7fDg:1586341054747&#038;source=lnms&#038;tbm=isch&#038;sa=X&#038;ved=2ahUKEwic6L34zNjoAhVLV80KHRODACMQ_AUoAXoECBYQAw&#038;biw=1427&#038;bih=899\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lombard Street<\/a> look like a straight line. The &#8220;MIXERS&#8221; addition to match the original logo is perfectly executed with the &#8220;M&#8221; being a flipped &#8220;W&#8221;, the &#8220;e&#8221; being unicase like the &#8220;n&#8221; and the &#8220;R&#8221; being weird for, well, just for shits and giggles. I really love both logos for their sheer typographic joy and amount of fucks given &#8212; zero.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/swoon_mixers_packaging_before_after.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Swoon Mixers done In-House in collaboration with CENTER\" \/>\n<figcaption>Packaging, before and after.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old bottles were pretty nice, although they had even <em>more<\/em> fonts on it than just the logo. The new bottles are pretty nice too, with some vivacious illustrations that give the product a lot of texture. The one strange thing is how much &#8220;SWOON&#8221; recedes into the background by keeping it in the lavender brand color that, one, doesn&#8217;t mix so well with the other colors and, two, is far too light to compete with everything else around it. I assume the goal was to prioritize and push mixers and, to that end, it did succeed.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/swoon_mixers_packaging_all.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Swoon Mixers done In-House in collaboration with CENTER\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/swoon_mixers_bottles_detail.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Swoon Mixers done In-House in collaboration with CENTER\" \/>\n<figcaption>Bottles.
