Ugmonk is a charming family affair with the warehouse headquartered in his parents&#8217; basement, orders fulfilled by his mom, and customer service handled by his sister-in-law. (Love it.) The design approach to the products is minimal, clean, crisp, and with a personal attention to detail that has earned Ugmonk a devoted audience. Last month the site introduced its 2.0 version and a new logo and identity to go with it designed by, yup, Downingtown, PA-based Jeff.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>As Ugmonk matured into a &#8220;real&#8221; brand, the logo seemed to fit less and less with our reputation. As a refined lifestyle brand, we were creating products with clean lines and a minimalist aesthetic, while our logo was heavy and too quirky. Still, I felt nervous about redesigning it since it had become so recognizable and carried so much equity.<br \/><br \/>[&hellip;]<br \/><br \/>The new wordmark is based off of the GT Walsheim typeface. I made some small modifications to the letter forms to smooth out some of the transitions and tweak the widths of the letters to balance things out and unify the mark. The new logo echoes the round, geometric forms of the original, and still carries a hint of the quirkiness with the crossbar of the &#8220;G.&#8221; But its lighter weight and cleaner aesthetic embodies Ugmonk and what we represent.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/ugmonk.com\/2016\/06\/04\/the-design-process-behind-the-rebrand\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ugmonk blog post<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ugmonk_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity by and for Ugmonk\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>In the <a href=\"http:\/\/ugmonk.com\/2016\/06\/04\/the-design-process-behind-the-rebrand\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">blog post<\/a> quoted above, Jeff was maybe too kind on himself about the old logo &#8212; &#8220;I was more interested in making something that looked cool&#8221; &#8212; which is cute as that logo does NOT look cool. Pretty much a monstrosity. Now, you might be saying, &#8220;Hey, ease up, buddy; Jeff is a nice guy&#8221;&#8230; Of course but that doesn&#8217;t make the logo any better. More important than how much I don&#8217;t like the old logo is how unrelated it was to the actual products with a very real disconnect in style and refinement. Coming to that realization was an important step. The new logo is not as <em>cool<\/em> as the old one &#8212; in the sense that it&#8217;s comparatively plain &#8212; but it does reflect attention to detail and the minimal approach is more in tune with the products and ethos that drive Ugmonk. The &#8220;G&#8221; retains some of the quirkiness of the old logo but in general instills a classy, airy approach that is more fitting.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ugmonk_icon.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity by and for Ugmonk\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icon.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ugmonk_icon_process.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity by and for Ugmonk\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icon structure.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ugmonk_icon_logo_animation.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity by and for Ugmonk\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icon and logo animation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The new icon is good and effective.

The kraft box, bag, and tape; the matte poly bags; the natural canvas bag&#8230; they are all design-y without being pretentious and they reflect a down-to-earth approach that is also evident in how the company presents itself online and in social media. Overall, a lovely maturity and an enjoyable success story that gives us all encouragement to take the plunge and follow our passions.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 2008 by Jeff Sheldon as a side project to complement his full-time job at the time, Ugmonk began offering four t-shirt designs and is now a full-blown lifestyle brand offering t-shirts (more than four), caps, messenger bags, and&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,86,26],"tags":[53,42,446],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4772"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4772"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4772\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4772"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4772"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4772"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
