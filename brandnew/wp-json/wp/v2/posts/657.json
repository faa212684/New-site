The first element of the identity is the logo, an arrow created from the name of the observatory in Japanase with the English translation hinged at a vertiginous 45-degree angle. What I love about this is the use of the usually cumbersome need of a logo to appear in two languages, into an integrated solution, as opposed to just repeating the name smaller in the second language. I&#8217;m also a sucker for hot pink, so I&#8217;m really drawn to wherever the arrow is pointing. Which brings us to the second element of the identity.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sendai_angles.jpg\" alt=\"Sendai Logo Angles\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The logo, being a helpful arrow, can point into any direction and &mdash; like a kid or adult pointing at the sky when somehting otherworldly appears there &mdash; the SAO arrow points to a range of images that johnson banks have developed around the theme of &#8220;bringing the cosmos down to earth&#8221; where everyday objects are paired with supernovas, planetary rings and four-dimensional vortexes, creating a playful range of imagery that makes the cosmos even more appealing. <\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sendai_reveals.jpg\" alt=\"Sendai Images\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sendai_sign_football.jpg\" alt=\"Sendai Graphics\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sendai_sign_orbit.jpg\" alt=\"Sendai Graphics\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Another clever twist are the business cards and letterhead that translate the same idea of the paired images into a front-and-back game, although I doubt the identity guidelines recommend dog-earing the business cards. So aside from the remarkable skills it must have taken to bend Akzidenz Grotesk Condensed at that angle, I really like the flexibility and variety that this identity can render, as well as the integration of English and Japanese, and there is a very interesting, almost non-aesthetic aesthetic that creates a stark, vibrant visual language. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.johnsonbanks.co.uk\/thoughtfortheweek\/index.php?thoughtid=346\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A few more images can be found at johnson banks&#8217; web site<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sendai_stationery.jpg\" alt=\"Senad Business Card and Letterhead\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sendai_signage.jpg\" alt=\"Sendai Signage\" \/><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[63,12,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/657"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=657"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/657\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=657"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=657"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=657"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
