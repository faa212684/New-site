Interestingly, according to <a href=\"http:\/\/about.king.com\/advertising?language=en_US\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">their advertising page<\/a>, 75% of their players are women and 70% have children. King has offices in London, Stockholm, Barcelona, Bucharest, Hamburg, Malta, Malmo and San Francisco. Today, King introduced a new identity designed by London-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.venturethree.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">venturethree<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/king_logo_detail_flat.gif\" alt=\"King Logo\" \/><\/p>\n<blockquote>The new brand, based around the philosophy of &#8216;Bitesize Brilliance&#8217; is designed to position King as the leader in cross-platform, snackable entertainment experiences. [&hellip;] &#8220;We wanted to create an iconic visual identity for King that could sit alongside HBO and Pixar as a mark of the highest quality in entertainment. We designed a quirky new logo writing King in the shape of a crown &#8211; capable of working at 16 pixels square but at the same time scalable enough to make a big impact. Games like Candy Crush Saga are what people love about King, so we created a brand that compliments rather than dominates.&#8221;<br \/>&mdash; venturethree project description<\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/king_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"King Logo\" \/><\/p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/62783359?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=ffffff\" width=\"574\" height=\"323\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">On-screen animations.<\/p>\n<p>The previous logo didn&#8217;t hold any surprises in its message or execution: a crown over the word King, punctuated by a 1990s &#8220;.com&#8221;. A decent logo for sure, considering the gaudiness of online video game title logos. The new logo smartly drops the &#8220;.com&#8221; not only leading to a cleaner logo but strategically giving other gaming companies the finger in the most elegant way by proclaiming they are the king. No questions asked. The logo takes a minute to decode. At first it looks like any number of Dodgers-inspired script logos but then the crown comes into focus once you see the exaggerated (and, in any other logo, completely awkward) upper arm of the &#8220;K&#8221; and its terminal, centered in between two other exaggerated ball terminals in the &#8220;K&#8221; and &#8220;g&#8221;, the latter swooping down and left to meet the stem of the &#8220;K&#8221; to get all Gestalt on the bottom of the crown. In less words: it&#8217;s awesome. In application (see below) the logo is tilted and placed on top of people and characters, straddling the line between annoying and clever, but it mostly works. The logo is accompanied by a confetti of elements from King&#8217;s games and the whole set-up is loose and fun. What this project lacks in gravitas it makes up for in candy-colored, no-worries vibes. Also in less words: perfect for the company and its audience.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/king_application_01.jpg\" alt=\"King Logo\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/king_application_02.jpg\" alt=\"King Logo\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/king_application_03.jpg\" alt=\"King Logo\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/king_application_04.jpg\" alt=\"King Logo\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/king_application_05.jpg\" alt=\"King Logo\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/king_application_06.jpg\" alt=\"King Logo\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/king_application_07.jpg\" alt=\"King Logo\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/king_application_08.jpg\" alt=\"King Logo\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks also to Justin Glasson for the tip.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_130327_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_130327_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_130327_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_130327_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,66,26],"tags":[764,41,54,537],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2397"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2397"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2397\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2397"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2397"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2397"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
