The Warriors compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA), as a member of the league&#8217;s Western Conference Pacific Division. Founded in 1946 in Philadelphia, the Warriors relocated to the San Francisco Bay Area in 1962 and took the city&#8217;s name, before changing its geographic moniker to Golden State in 1971. They play their home games at the Chase Center. Nicknamed the Dubs as a shortening of &#8220;W&#8217;s&#8221;,[7][8] the Warriors hold several NBA records; they have registered the best ever regular season, most wins in a season (regular season and postseason combined), as well as the best ever postseason run. With the combined shooting of Curry and Thompson, they are credited as one of the greatest backcourts of all time. The team&#8217;s six NBA championships are tied for third-most in NBA history with the Chicago Bulls. According to Forbes, the Warriors are the seventh highest valued sports franchise in the United States, and joint-tenth in the world, with an estimated value of approximately $3.1 billion.&#8221; (<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Golden_State_Warriors\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wikipedia<\/a><\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/golden_state_warriors_2019_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logos for Golden State Warriors\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/golden_state_warriors_2019_logo_alternates.png\" alt=\"New Logos for Golden State Warriors\" \/>\n<figcaption>Possible alternates, NOT officially announced, although the &#8220;W&#8221; one is acknowledged in the relevant quote.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"(Est. 1971) &quot;The Golden State Warriors are an American professional basketball team based in San Francisco, California.
