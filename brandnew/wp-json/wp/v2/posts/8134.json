Vungle works on more than 60,000 mobile apps created by publishers and advertisers that range from indie studios to mainstream brands, including Rovio, Zynga, Pandora, Microsoft, and Scopely, among others through tools that include &#8220;data-led buying and UX recommendations, ad format innovation, creative automation, and more&#8221;. With over 250 employees in seven offices around the world, headquartered in San Francisco, CA, the company was recently acquired by Blackstone, one of the world&#8217;s leading investment firms, to support and accelerate Vungle&#8217;s growth &#8212; along with that announcement it introduced a new identity designed by London, UK-based <a href=\"https:\/\/multiadaptor.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MultiAdaptor<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote><strong>Brand idea<\/strong><br \/><br \/>A deep immersion into the business resulted in a powerful idea to propel the business forward and crystallise a sense of what makes Vungle special. We called this idea Creative Performance.<br \/><br \/>It&#8217;s a core organising thought that combines Vungle&#8217;s biggest strength &#8212; its innovative creative technologies, processes and people &#8212; with its customers&#8217; most important need: hard results.<br \/><br \/>From products and services to culture and image, it&#8217;s an idea to drive every part of the company.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/multiadaptor.com\/work\/vungle\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MultiAdaptor project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/350964874?title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"360\" height=\"203\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Brand positioning, illustrated.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote><strong>Brand personality<\/strong><br \/><br \/>Inspired by recurring themes that came from long-standing clients and staff alike &#8212; and against a backdrop of the cold, corporate brands in the category &#8212; we defined three core attributes that were authentic to Vungle, and could help set them apart from the competition: Analytical, Creative and Personable.<br \/><br \/>They would form the foundation of the brand identity and help to create a compelling impression for people yet to experience all the great things about partnering with Vungle.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/multiadaptor.com\/work\/vungle\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MultiAdaptor project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/vungle_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Vungle by MultiAdaptor\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo was really bad, which could have been avoided if they had left the &#8220;g&#8221; alone and not stretched it so awkwardly so that it least would have been an old-Airbnb-esque script logo but that would still have not made sense for what the company is or does. The new logo is a much more mature manifestation and even if on its own it has no meaning it now conveys that, as an app publisher, you will be working with a serious company that knows its stuff. The new logo, which looks like a custom drawing based on Optimo&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.optimo.ch\/typefaces_Px-Grotesk.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Px Grotesk<\/a>, is pretty cool and different enough from the generic geometric sans serif to make it a stronger stand-alone wordmark. The only thing I&#8217;m not sure about is the left half of the &#8220;V&#8221; being lighter&#8230; perhaps a simple stencil cut and keeping the same darkness would have set up better the use of the &#8220;V&#8221; as the monogram where the left half is flexible, which is the highlight of the identity.<\/p>\n<blockquote>At the centre of the identity is the V symbol &#8211; which embodies the idea of Creative Performance. The left half of the V is an ever-changing expression of creativity, while the right symbolises the result: progression and growth.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/multiadaptor.com\/work\/vungle\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MultiAdaptor project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\" style=\"padding-bottom: 63.25%;\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/vungle_logo_animations.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Monogram animations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>I like the different extremes of what the left half of the &#8220;V&#8221; can do and how it isn&#8217;t just an angled stick rendered in different ways. At times it even stops reading as a &#8220;V&#8221; and becomes a slash, which is not a terrible thing, given its connotations to internet things. The animations really help sell the approach but even in static form the point comes across.<\/p>\n<blockquote>Vungle&#8217;s identity is inspired by the vibrant world of apps and games, combined with the analytical precision of data. The result is a colourful, flexible brand that feels playful and technical; sophisticated, yet approachable.<br \/><br \/>As a primarily digital brand, the identity is designed to feel alive and ever-changing across social media channels, website and Vungle&#8217;s product platform.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/multiadaptor.com\/work\/vungle\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MultiAdaptor project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/348399523?title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"360\" height=\"203\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Toolkit.
