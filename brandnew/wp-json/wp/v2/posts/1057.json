On March 9th, two days before Sebasti&aacute;n Pi&ntilde;era inauguration, his appointed-to-be speaker announced a new official logo for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gobiernodechile.cl\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the incoming administration<\/a>. Pi&ntilde;era, a conservative businessman, won a run-off in last january, becoming the first right-wing candidate to be democratically elected President in 52 years.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>&#8220;In these hard times this country&#8217;s on, it&#8217;s necessary to appeal to the nation&#8217;s unity. That&#8217;s why we were finding a symbol that could represent our history and that could make every Chilean identified with&#8221;. &mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.elmostrador.cl\/noticias\/pais\/2010\/03\/10\/el-demoledor-analisis-de-los-disenadores-al-nuevo-logo-de-pinera\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ena von Baer, new government speaker<\/a>.<\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/chile_gob_logo_detail.jpg\" alt=\"Gobierno de Chile\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Guess what? The nation&#8217;s unity depends on putting back together the good old coat of arms. Designed by Hambre, a local agency that has been working along with Pi&ntilde;era since he was a candidate. According to the Chilean Constitution, the coat of arms actually is an official nation symbol, but most Chileans relate that to <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Chile_under_Pinochet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the seventeen years of Augusto Pinochet&#8217;s dictatorship<\/a> between 1973 and 1990. Sometimes, historic symbols divide people. Besides, it&#8217;s grey! And it&#8217;s tough! Definitely not friendly as the coat also includes the controversial motto &#8220;Por la raz&oacute;n o la fuerza&#8221; (&#8220;By right or might&#8221;).<\/p>\n<p>The problem is that the incoming government doesn&#8217;t know the difference between &#8220;historic&#8221; and &#8220;timeless.&#8221; A timeless icon may be historic, but not the other way round. Well, that&#8217;s just half of the issue. &#8220;This typeface is a modern type that shows future and a colorful hope&#8221;, von Baer said. Wrong. It&#8217;s Century Gothic, a typeface you can find in most of Windows computers. Government picked a randomly chosen future. <\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/chile_gob_logo_1color.gif\" alt=\"Gobierno de Chile\" \/><\/p>\n<p>And the logo itself has serious problems. It won&#8217;t work in a minimum size: the motto on the coat of arms will be impossible to read when printed small, and it was not conceived for its usage in one color, as well: were the waves tested in one color? Those are problems a designer should care while preparing the usage guidelines manual, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gobiernodechile.cl\/descarga\/Manual_de_Normas_Graficas_Gobierno_de_Chile.pdf\">and judging from the actual Chile government guidelines<\/a> [PDF], the one-color logo is quite a mess.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/chile_gob_foto.jpg\" alt=\"Gobierno de Chile\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">President Pi&ntilde;era and First Lady Cecilia Morel wearing a red jacket with a logo in white, March 11th. Source: FotoPresidencia.<\/p>\n<p>Since this logo was announced, people (design professionals or not) say through social media this mark is too expensive &mdash; a reported US$200,000 &mdash; to be that ugly. Others say this is a clip art <em>and<\/em> Word art combined. Webzines are challenging their readers to design something as cheap as the official logo. Even the parent owner of Hambre, lawyer Hern&aacute;n Larra&iacute;n Matte, son of a conservative senator and member of influential families in Chile, has become the laughing stock of Facebook and Twitter.<\/p>\n<object width=\"574\" height=\"460\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/-3VBpXTS4qQ&#038;hl=en_US&#038;fs=1&#038;\"><\/param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"><\/param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"><\/param><embed src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/-3VBpXTS4qQ&#038;hl=en_US&#038;fs=1&#038;\" type=\"application\/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"574\" height=\"460\"><\/embed><\/object>\n<p class=\"caption\">&#8220;12 things I hate about Government logo&#8221;, one of the multiple jokes about the new symbol.
