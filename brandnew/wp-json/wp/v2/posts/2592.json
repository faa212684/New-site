Bad, bad idea, bad! Seriously, look at that &#8220;S&#8221;. Who does that and thinks, &#8220;That&#8217;s cool, let&#8217;s put it on our website.&#8221;<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">I guess first and foremost try to unsee the image directly above which I am sure was done by an overzealous marketing expert. (I did feel the need to show it you because, well, look at it!). Anyway. Fidelidade translates as &#8220;loyalty&#8221; so the use of a dog since way back when the company was founded is a concept with plenty of merit and it&#8217;s a much better reference than whatever ambiguous globe-star-icon thing Fidelidade was working with for a while. Red is a good color and together with the silhouette of the dog make for a semi-decent wordmark. There is something I want to like in the logo and in its 3D execution &mdash; there is glimmers of hope in there. But I would have stopped the dog + red concept at the logo before putting red dogs on TV. It transforms an otherwise effective identity design into a weird caricature that is almost as absurd as Clifford the Big Red Dog. Cute it is not, Photoshopped it looks. (Not sure why like Yoda I started speaking). Overall, a decent identity evolution overshadowed by red dogs.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1808 and 1835 respectively Fidelidade Mundial and Imp&eacute;rio Bonan&ccedil;a have merged under the name Fidelidade to establish the leading life and non-life insurance provider in Portugal.
