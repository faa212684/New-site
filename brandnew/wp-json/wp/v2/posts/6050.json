Founders Bradford and Bryan Manning were both diagnosed with an eye disease that causes blindness over time. [&hellip;] Unlike other lines, the Two Blind Brothers collection is not outsourced. The production is located in the heart of the fashion district in New York City. Despite the first-rate nature of the designs, fabrics, and assembly, the value to the customer is extraordinary compared to other luxury designers because the brothers fund the operation without being paid a salary. All proceeds are instead donated to life-changing research to cure blindness. The research is guided by a team at the Foundation Fighting Blindness. Among other incredible medical achievements, this team has helped develop a successful gene therapy for Leber&#8217;s Congenital Amaurosis (LCA). Other cures are close behind including one for Stargardt&#8217;s disease, which affects Bradford and Bryan.&#8221;<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/two_blind_brothers_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Two Blind Brothers by SMAKK Studios\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/two_blind_brothers_logo_explanation.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Two Blind Brothers by SMAKK Studios\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo explanation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/two_blind_brothers_business_cards.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Two Blind Brothers by SMAKK Studios\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/two_blind_brothers_packaging.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Two Blind Brothers by SMAKK Studios\" \/>\n<figcaption>Packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/two_blind_brothers_graphic_language.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Two Blind Brothers by SMAKK Studios\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/two_blind_brothers_graphic_language_2.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Two Blind Brothers by SMAKK Studios\" \/>\n<figcaption>Graphic language.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"(Est. 2015) &#8220;Two Blind Brothers is a luxury clothing line on a mission to cure blindness.
