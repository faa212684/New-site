Transporting over 12 million passengers a year, it is the second largest airline in the country behind Ryanair (which has a massive 400-plane fleet compared to Aer Lingus&#8217; 67) and flies to more than 100 destinations in the UK and Europe plus 17 direct routes to North America. Based in Dublin Airport, Aer Lingus is a member of International Airlines Group (IAG). As part of its strategy to become the leading value carrier across the North Atlantic, increasing its fleet from 17 to 30 by 2023, Aer Lingus introduced a new identity designed by <a href=\"https:\/\/lippincott.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lippincott<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>The new logo retains but restyles the iconic shamrock, adding a tilt to symbolise dynamism and speed, with heart-shaped leaves reflecting the warmth and hospitality of the brand.

The new logo looks more like a modern-day airline logo with the wider wordmark, which is based on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.myfonts.com\/fonts\/indian-type-foundry\/diodrum\/?refby=ucllc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Diodrum<\/a>, a spurless sans (which is my least favorite font category) that has been customized to have a wider &#8220;e&#8221; and &#8220;s&#8221; as well as a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.omniglot.com\/images\/writing\/clogaelach.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gaelic-ish &#8220;g&#8221;<\/a>. I really like that last detail as a concept and in the shape of the &#8220;g&#8221; but amidst the rest of the letters it stands out weirdly, in part because all of the letters have been each slightly customized and don&#8217;t quite gel together &#8212; the &#8220;s&#8221; in particular looks like it belongs in a Saul Bass airline logo, not here. The new shamrock is quite nice. I like how they kept the asymmetry and angle while softening the leaf shapes. Maybe it&#8217;s a little corny they are heart shapes but it still reads as a shamrock first. The shading, especially on the stem is a little confusing though and (as you&#8217;ll see in the last few images) I think the icon works well in a single color.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/aer_lingus_business_class_logo.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Livery for Aer Lingus by Lippincott\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/aer_lingus_business_class_tag.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Livery for Aer Lingus by Lippincott\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business class logo and tag.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The iron shamrock for business class, unfortunately, needs a complete redo. This is a very strange rendering that has a weird logic and combination of shadows and highlights. Also, when pairing the customized Diodrum wordmark with Diodrum out of the box, it makes for an odd couple.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/aer_lingus_guidelines.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Livery for Aer Lingus by Lippincott\" \/>\n<figcaption>Guidelines.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/aer_lingus_safety_card.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Livery for Aer Lingus by Lippincott\" \/>\n<figcaption>Safety card.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Not much in terms of application&#8230; lots of Diodrum based on the guidelines.

The first is within the new logo, the second sits on the tailfin, a third welcomes guests at the door, and a final surprise on the wingtip is in prime position for capturing on social media. The body of the new look Aer Lingus aircraft will be white with a teal-coloured tail and engines, bringing a sleek, contemporary feel to the design. The teal undercarriage means that Aer Lingus will be instantly recognisable to those on the ground.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/mediacentre.aerlingus.com\/news\/17012019\/aer-lingus-unveils-brand-refresh-as-part-of-its-strategy-to-become-the-leading-value-carrier-across-the-north-atlantic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Aer Lingus press release<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/aer_lingus_livery_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Livery for Aer Lingus by Lippincott\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/aer_lingus_livery_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Livery for Aer Lingus by Lippincott\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/aer_lingus_livery_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Livery for Aer Lingus by Lippincott\" \/>\n<figcaption>Livery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old livery felt very heavy with the whole upper half of the plane painted teal.
