Owned by Nelonen Media (which owns a number of other channels and radio stations), Liv&#8217;s main audience is in the 25- to 45-year-olds showing original programming that includes series and reality shows as well as U.S. imports like <em>Scandal<\/em> and <em>The Good Wife<\/em>. Briefed with making the channel &#8220;look big again, fitting its position as market leader&#8221; a new logo and on-air graphics designed by Hilversum, the Netherlands-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.caperock.tv\/ target=\"_blank\">Cape Rock<\/a> were introduced in September.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>The designs give it a cosmopolitan rich look and feel yet grounded in Finland. The channel is colourful, dynamic and vibrant. Liv positions itself as a trusted voice, pointing you in the right direction for entertainment and lifestyle. By making the logo a colourful pointer the channel literally can start to point its audiences in the right direction. Liv shares the great moments in life. The channel guides you towards those great moments. The idents reflect this personality in short stories around these moments you share with friends. The on-air package is bright and colourful reflecting the relaxed and sunny nature of the channel.<\/blockquote><h3>Provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/liv_tv_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo and On-air Look for Liv by Cape Rock\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/liv_tv_logo_colors.png\" alt=\"New Logo and On-air Look for Liv by Cape Rock\" \/>\n<figcaption>Color and orientation details.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo was relatively nice and feminine, except for the color green, which didn&#8217;t go as well with it but I can see how they would arrive at green (liv = life = plants = green \/ or something). The new logo uses the now ubiquitous internet map pointer shape &mdash; what used to be simply the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/speakup\/archives\/002412.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">circle-with-a-square-corner<\/a> graphic device &mdash; as a smart metaphor for leading the way or pinpointing a moment in time. The typography inside looks decent if a little bland. (I particularly like it because I am a closet fan of Georgia Bold Italic). Static, the logo isn&#8217;t anything memorable but it has been brought to life quite nicely on air.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/74951491?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=ffffff\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>On-air graphics.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/liv_tv_typography.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and On-air Look for Liv by Cape Rock\" \/>\n<figcaption>Typography detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/liv_tv_pointer_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and On-air Look for Liv by Cape Rock\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/liv_tv_pointer_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and On-air Look for Liv by Cape Rock\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/liv_tv_pointer_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and On-air Look for Liv by Cape Rock\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/liv_tv_pointer_04.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and On-air Look for Liv by Cape Rock\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo in action.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">I really like the smooth, responsive motion of the logo as it reacts to what&#8217;s happening with the footage, making it feel part of the whole scene and not just tacked on. The other animation behavior that I really like is how the three pointer shapes come together. Less satisfying but very much on target is the swirly, flower-petal-like behavior.The on-air typography switches to Archer, which is always a safe and good-looking choice but it just makes me wonder why they didn&#8217;t use Archer italic in the logo for a better match. Overall, the on-air graphics establish a clear, assertive, and feel-good feminine attitude that a husband or boyfriend wouldn&#8217;t mind sitting through.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Launched in 2009, Liv (Swedish for &quot;Life&quot;) is the leading television channel for women in Finland.
