My favorite part of this project is the logo, which captures perfectly the attitude and demeanor of a hungry dude watching TV waiting for food to arrive. It&#8217;s a perfectly captured slouch. The patterns and color palette make it feel like the meal comes with its own party and conga line. Which would require getting up from the chair, unfortunately. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/Espere-Sentado\/9334627\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Granum<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_granum.jpg\" alt=\"Granum\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px;\">We&#8217;ve all had this idea at one point or another, of bending and tilting in perspective some type &mdash; we even had a sample of it with Pentagram&#8217;s work for MUSE in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_39.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Friday Likes 39<\/a> &mdash; but sometimes more than a better concept or another idea what this specific idea needs is commitment, to go all the way. And Moscow-based <a href=\"http:\/\/maksimarbuzov.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Maksim Arbuzov<\/a> has done just that for local architecture firm, <a href=\"http:\/\/thegranum.ru\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Granum<\/a>. The logo comes in a faux bend and faux-bent typeface but the really fun part is when the typography is played straight but applied on the corners and angles of stuff, from box tape to pencils. Nice precision executed in a nonchalant way. <a href=\"http:\/\/maksimarbuzov.com\/#\/granum-identity\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Adobe Max 2013<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_adobemax.jpg\" alt=\"Adobe Max 2013\" \/>\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"http:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/69233952?portrait=0&amp;color=84eaea\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px;\">I&#8217;ll be the first one to admit that this is not my style nor does it fit the usual style of other Friday Likes but there is a level of craft and attention to detail here that&#8217;s quite admirable. For the annual Adobe Max extravaganza conference, Barcelona-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.vasava.es\/en\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Vasava<\/a> was responsible for the &#8220;Key visuals&#8221; for the event. I&#8217;m not sure, and I would assume the designers are not even sure, what the execution means other than it conforms to the Adobe Max logo of previous years and then it&#8217;s just, like, stuff with stuff around stuff textured with stuff. Stuff, by the way, is cool. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.vasava.es\/en\/project\/#\/356\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"A lot of textures and colors in this edition of Friday Likes, with work from Moscow, Porto, and Barcelona&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[790,567,130],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2562"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2562"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2562\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2562"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2562"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2562"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
