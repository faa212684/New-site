In-house designers, rejoice. Anyone who has worked in-house knows the complicated process projects go through and their lengthy approval. To get a company to buy into a new corporate identity is a big deal, especially when it&#8217;s done in-house and not outsourced to a firm.<\/p><!--more--><p>Based out of Washington, DC, &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.gtsi.com\">GTSI<\/a> is a government solutions company that has revamped itself from being a product reseller to a full solutions enabled company.&#8221; To better reflect the gamut of services offered, the in-house team of two redesigned what was a dated early 90s mark (color and all) into a more streamlined version with a nice tag line. The typography is improved, going from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.myfonts.com\/fonts\/fontbureau\/bodega-sans\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bodega Sans<\/a> to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.houseind.com\/index.php?page=showfont&#038;id=140\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Chalet Book<\/a>. While the &#8220;g\/t&#8221; ligature is interestingly quirky,the &#8220;i&#8221; bugs me; it seems to have too much presence and guides you out into the registration mark. Overall it is quite an accomplishment to keep a project of this magnitude in-house and have some nice design come out of it.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":15,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,26,88],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/532"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/15"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=532"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/532\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=532"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=532"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=532"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
