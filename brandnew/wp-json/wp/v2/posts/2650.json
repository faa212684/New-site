Over 400,000 people currently receive Birchboxes around the world, men and women. In June, Birchbox introduced a new identity designed by Brooklyn, NY-based <a href=\"http:\/\/redantler.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Red Antler<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>Birchbox is so much more than just the box. We have myriad ways for you to discover. Turning our original box logo on its side to create a diamond represents both a literal and figurative transformation.<br \/><br \/>The diamond in our new logo represents the Birchbox &#8220;spark&#8221; &mdash; that &#8220;aha&#8221; moment of your experience: finding a new product in our Shop that matches your exact need, opening your monthly box to discover an enticing sample, or watching a video that turns you on to a genius technique. Birchbox strives to provide these spark moments at every turn, making a diamond the perfect representation.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/blog.birchbox.com\/post\/52057946367\/blood-sweat-and-fonts-birchboxs-creative-director\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Birchbox blog<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/birchbox_evolution.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Birchbox by Red Antler\" \/>\n<figcaption>Evolution explanation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/birchbox_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Birchbox by Red Antler\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>At first glance it feels that Birchbox lost, by replacing its recognizable fuchsia splatter box with nothing more than a small diamond. The old logo was nice, although the typography was extremely light and probably impossible to use at small sizes. The new logo remedies the typography with a simple, uppercase sans serif and tucks the &#8220;spark&#8221; at the end of the &#8220;X&#8221; which helps frame it nicely. Pound for pound, the logo change is almost an even result, both better and worse in different regards. In application, however, and with the &#8220;B&#8221; monograms, Birchbox has definitely won.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/birchbox_patterns_01.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Birchbox by Red Antler\" \/>\n<figcaption>Patterns and marks.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>For the rebrand, our team set out to create an overarching brand experience for Birchbox that stayed true to its fun and whimsical personality, and strategically positioned it as a global leader in the next era of e-commerce. The resulting brand identity introduces an updated logo and brand mark that are strongly recognizable, yet adaptable for a variety of applications. Additionally, we used bright pops of color to set apart playful icons and textured graphic patterns in support of the brand&#8217;s energetic personality. All elements are finished with refined messaging, clean typefaces, and crisp photography across brand applications from website to packaging.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/redantler.com\/birchbox-red-antler-2013\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Red Antler blog post<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/birchbox_language.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Birchbox by Red Antler\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/birchbox_language_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Birchbox by Red Antler\" \/>\n<figcaption>Visual language.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/birchbox_guideline_pages.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Birchbox by Red Antler\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sample pages of brand guidelines.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/birchbox_box_detail.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Birchbox by Red Antler\" \/>\n<figcaption>The Birchbox box, outside.
