When I first used it, I think it was here in New York, I don&#8217;t remember using it in Chicago, I had the impression that my only options would be flavorless diners or MSG-laden Chinese holes in the wall &mdash; no offense to either &mdash; because of the web site&#8217;s kitschy, beveled logo. Of course, nothing could be further from reality, MenuPages has always had menus for the best restaurants in town and it&#8217;s only now, with a new logo by the &uuml;ber typographers at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.muccadesign.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mucca Design<\/a>, that the web site reflects a more varied and interested selection than your typical take-out joint. The new logo is more upscale, and may perhaps feel too New York-centric, like something you would see tiled on a subway platform, but the improvement is undeniable and attractive. The web site is a fantastic improvement as well.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.seamlesscreative.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Courtney Dolloff<\/a> for the tip.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,69,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/757"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=757"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/757\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=757"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=757"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=757"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
