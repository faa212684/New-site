It&#8217;s a pretty original way of treating a monogram, specially when it looks like just an elongated &#8220;B&#8221; when seen flat. This would pose a problem for other applications but the ambitious wood-based business cards also feature a fold where the monogram can be creased and in the letterhead it&#8217;s placed in the upper fold, creating the edge effect. (No, the effect doesn&#8217;t fax). Simple and clever &mdash; not what you would expect from cutting board branding.  <a href=\"http:\/\/maud.com.au\/#\/edgeboard\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Khulu Soap by Fanakalo<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_khulusoaps.jpg\" alt=\"Khulu Soap by Fanakalo\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">Made from traditional African herbs <a href=\"http:\/\/khulusoap.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Khulu Soap<\/a> is delivered in a fantastically rich range of packaging designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fanakalo.co.za\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fanakalo<\/a> in Stellenbosch, South Africa.

Designed by Block in Perth, Australia, the identity features a combination of neatly cropped and clipped product shots and an abstract, custom alphabet that takes its cues from architectural blueprints. The combination leads to what I can only describe as ethereal, alien-like, interior design chic. Some words are more successful &mdash; like &#8220;work&#8221; &mdash; than others &mdash; &#8220;futio&#8221;? &mdash; per the examples above but identity definitely establishes a distinct visual language for District. <a href=\"http:\/\/blockbranding.com\/work\/district-branding\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project here<\/strong><\/a><\/strong>.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"An eclectic range of simple work mixed in with some abstract work and highly ornate work from Australia and South Africa keep us entertained this fine Friday&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[1076,40,769],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3428"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3428"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3428\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3428"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3428"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3428"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
