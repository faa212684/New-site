Last week they announced a change to their brand name, to Western University, and introduced a new identity designed by Toronto-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hahnsmithdesign.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hahn Smith Design<\/a> and execution of the crest and typography by local type craftsman <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ianbrignell.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ian Brignell<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>Chief among the changes will be the adoption of Western University as the institution&#8217;s widely used moniker. The university&#8217;s official name remains The University of Western Ontario, and will continue to appear as such on diplomas and official documents. But for communication, marketing and web purposes, Western University &mdash; or, at times, simply Western &mdash; will be the name. [&hellip;]<br \/><br \/>Goldthorp admitted the end design is not revolutionary, in fact, it could be considered downright traditional. &#8220;People might say, &#8216;That&#8217;s not so radical.&#8217; And my answer is, &#8216;Absolutely not.&#8217; It is not supposed to be radical; it is supposed to be coming back where you started and knowing yourself much better.&#8221;<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/communications.uwo.ca\/western_news\/stories\/2012\/January\/western_rolls_out_new_branding.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press Release<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe width=\"574\" height=\"292\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Ww6GqNrvCFY\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Identity introduction.

Whoever filtered that tower in Photoshop should have their graphic designing license revoked &mdash; or at least their Adobe serial number canceled. So pretty much anything would have been an improvement. And the new logo is. In a boring, institutional, traditional, coat-of-arms way. I mean, universities are consistently redesigning their way out of shield logos into more contemporary ideas, <em>not<\/em> adopting them in the second decade of the twenty-first century. As the quote says above, this isn&#8217;t radical and the intention was clearly to signal tradition and history, and the shield and typography are finely executed but there is nothing here we haven&#8217;t seen in the last 50 or 75 years of higher education identity design.
