Aside from listing properties on their site, Yopa submits to the big real estate portals and gives more control to the seller. Earlier this month, Yopa introduced a new identity designed by London-based <a href=\"http:\/\/someoneinlondon.com\/project\/putting_personality_into_property\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SomeOne<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>&#8216;It&#8217;s Personal&#8217; quickly became our strategic rudder, this naturally led us to a visual style based on a flexible speech bubble that visualises the voices of the agents themselves, but also of the customer. On top of this it doubles a neat location marker for pulling out properties on maps. Simple and flexible.<br \/><br \/>What&#8217;s really clever is how the speech bubble interacts with the &#8216;Y&#8217; symbol and even creates a lovely bit of &#8216;smile in the mind&#8217; with a second hidden &#8216;Y&#8217; in the negative space. A subtle nod to the notion that it&#8217;s Your Yopa.<\/blockquote><h3>SomeOne provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/yopa_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Yopa by SomeOne\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/yopa_logo_hidden_y.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Yopa by SomeOne\" \/>\n<figcaption>Hidden &#8220;Y&#8221;.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>We designed the colour scheme as a progression of the original to allow existing customers to feel at ease, knowing it was still the same brand they already knew and trusted, just with a fresh, bright new attitude. The colour update also tackled usability issues online &#8212; all the new colours pass screen accessibility requirements which was paramount given their majority online presence.<\/blockquote><h3>SomeOne provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/yopa_logo_colors.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Yopa by SomeOne\" \/>\n<figcaption>Color palette.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo was painfully bad, with a tiny door awkwardly placed to the left of the &#8220;Y&#8221; and a horrible intrusion from the &#8220;O&#8221; into the &#8220;P&#8221;. It looked like a wannabe real estate agency operating from a shack on the side of the road&#8230; In other words, not very trustworthy-looking and not consumer-friendly enough. The new logo doesn&#8217;t quite say &#8220;real estate&#8221; but it certainly &#8220;says&#8221; a lot, with a speech bubble as its main graphic hook. Usually, speech bubbles are clich\u00e9 and unoriginal but this one manages to be surprising and innovative, visually creating a stencil-like &#8220;Y&#8221; that becomes highly recognizable and, to boot, functional in application. The hidden &#8220;Y&#8221;, while cool and clever, may actually be a detriment because then it makes you wonder what that second &#8220;Y&#8221; stands for and even though the quote above explains it&#8217;s &#8220;Your Yopa&#8221;, that&#8217;s a stretch. Still, it&#8217;s a bold, playful mark that has been paired nicely with a bold sans serif using a double-storey &#8220;a&#8221;, instead of the expected circle and stick of geometric sans everywhere.<\/p>\n<blockquote>When used in isolation the &#8216;Y&#8217; symbol becomes part of the brand language meaning we can ask questions like &#8216;Y sell with Yopa?&#8217; or &#8216;Y wouldn&#8217;t you?&#8217;, starting truly branded dialogues and narrative.<br \/><br \/>Patterns and illustrations were introduced to bring extra charm and help tell more detailed parts of the Yopa story, especially online where they have a lot to say. Yopa&#8217;s in house teams continue to add new illustrations daily as the brand rolls out, further enriching the brand&#8217;s assets.<\/blockquote><h3>SomeOne provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/yopa_y_this_y_that.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Yopa by SomeOne\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sentences using the &#8220;Y&#8221; as &#8220;Why&#8221;.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/yopa_y_with_messaging.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Yopa by SomeOne\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/yopa_messaging_static.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Yopa by SomeOne\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/yopa_more_messaging.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Yopa by SomeOne\" \/>\n<figcaption>Speech bubble messaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/yopa_sale_sold_sign.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Yopa by SomeOne\" \/>\n<figcaption>Signs.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>In application, the speech bubble breaks from expectations by sticking to the &#8220;Y&#8221; and expanding upwards and to the right to accommodate messaging. It&#8217;s a great graphic behavior that keeps the emphasis on the &#8220;Y&#8221; and establishes as the anchor for the identity. The typography looks great in the bubble and the color variations keep things lively.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/yopa_map.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Yopa by SomeOne\" \/>\n<figcaption>Map markers.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/yopa_icons.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Yopa by SomeOne\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icons\/illustrations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/yopa_business_cards.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Yopa by SomeOne\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/yopa_letterhead.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Yopa by SomeOne\" \/>\n<figcaption>Letterhead.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/yopa_postcards.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Yopa by SomeOne\" \/>\n<figcaption>Postcards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/yopa_brochure.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Yopa by SomeOne\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brochure.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/yopa_pins.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Yopa by SomeOne\" \/>\n<figcaption>Pins.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The print applications get a little too busy at times or maybe it&#8217;s that the colors are too heavy-handed &#8212; the lack of white backgrounds may have something to do with this feeling.
