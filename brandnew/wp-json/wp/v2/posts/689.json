There has been no press release and no change on their <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hp.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">main web site<\/a>, but the use of this reworked logo has been making enough appearances to consider it a low-key rollout. I first saw the logo on a TV ad for HP&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hp.com\/united-states\/campaigns\/touchsmart\/#\/Main\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Touchscreen PC<\/a> &mdash; and I would recommend <a href=\"http:\/\/h30429.www3.hp.com\/index.jsp?fr_story=d7e768197db05cce67041278755d5e5e0f458b7a&#038;rf=sitemap\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">watching the ad<\/a> as it is pretty awesome &mdash; and then it has been popping up in print ads in a variety of mainstream magazines, including <em>Wired<\/em>, where the logo shown above comes from. The evolution looks interesting, I definitely like the removal of the holding shape which has always, to me at least, made it look more like the logo for a dishwasher. I also like how the circle now &#8220;masks&#8221; the italic hp letters, it gives the sense of there being more beyond what you are looking at. The shading doesn&#8217;t look great in the image above, but it&#8217;s a nice subtle execution, as opposed to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hockey_glowinthedark_edition.php\">the clunker two posts down<\/a>. A nice, punchy evolution.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong><span class=\"red\">Update:<\/span> A clean version of the new logo has kindly found its way into my inbox.
