The identity, designed by Mexico City, Mexico-based <a href=\"https:\/\/byhuman.mx\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Human<\/a>, is, as they describe it &#8220;Striking yet elegant, naughty yet principled, fun-loving and sexy&#8221; with the always-winning combination of black and red along with a spiky bold font for the menu and a classier serif for the logo, complemented by thorny icons like a trident, a rose\/dagger, and a flaming glass. I&#8217;m not a huge fan of the design per se but it certainly nails the mood of the place. There are really only two applications to see &#8212; business cards and menu &#8212; but they have presented the hell (ha!) out of it. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/92047861\/Kill-Devil\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Neuro by Herman-Scheer<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_neuro.jpg\" alt=\"Neuro by Herman-Scheer\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/getneuro.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Neuro<\/a> is a brand of nootropic-based energy gum and mints made from natural caffeine, L-theanine, and B-vitamins that aim to improve cognitive function and state of mind. The identity and packaging, designed by Los Angeles, CA-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.herman-scheer.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Herman-Scheer<\/a>, is fairly straightforward but its bright, happy, sunshine-y colors and airy typography begin to set the mood for the promised effects of the gum and mints. One detail that I really like is the differentiating icon for &#8220;Calm &amp; Clarity&#8221; (a sunset) and for &#8220;Energy &amp; Focus&#8221; (a spark) in the corner of the packaging and debossed on the actual product. The minimalist packaging also adds a touch of luxury that makes it look as if Altoids and Tiffany &amp; Co. had a baby. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.herman-scheer.com\/neuro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">ATM Pizza by Shift<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_atmpizza.jpg\" alt=\"ATM Pizza by Shift\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/atmpizza_mx\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ATM Pizza<\/a> is a pizza joint in Monterrey, Mexico, with a focus on delivering after-hours providing ample availability for pizza late into the night just as ATMs provide cashmoney all day long. The identity, designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/byshift.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Shift<\/a>, is unapologetically 1980s-tastic and has a clunky aesthetic (which feels to be done on purpose) best exemplified by the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.myfonts.com\/fonts\/linotype\/eurostile\/?refby=ucllc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Eurostile<\/a>-ish wordmark with thick VHS stripes and the biggest side serving of a registered mark that side of the border. Their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/atmpizza_mx\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Instagram account<\/a> is straight-up filled with bad nostalgia graphics and references and I&#8217;m here for all its gaudiness. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/94021179\/ATM-PIZZA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"A very well-photographed group of otherwise unrelated projects this week, with work from Mexico City, Los Angeles, and Monterrey&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[51,11,85,26],"tags":[1307,1701,1270,261,762,564],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8606"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=8606"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8606\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=8606"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=8606"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=8606"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
