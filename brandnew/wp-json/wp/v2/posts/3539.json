With the name change came a new identity by Toronto\/Mexico City-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.blokdesign.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Blok<\/a> based around the acronym that can be rendered as three circles with the underline or as &#8220;cee&#8221; in the same configuration. The &#8220;e&#8221;s are simply the &#8220;c&#8221; with an extra diagonal line and this unconventional &#8220;e&#8221; is what gives this identity its distinctive flavor. The color palette is so good too, exuding a wholesome and vibrant appeal. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.blokdesign.com\/#client\/cee\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">AVB Law Firm by Whiskey &amp; Mentine<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_avb.jpg\" alt=\"AVB Law by Whiskey &amp; Mentine\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">Although there is no website for AVB, which always makes question if the project is real, there <em>is<\/em> a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/pub\/valentina-bigi\/48\/377\/41b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LinkedIn profile<\/a> for the owner listed on the business cards so we&#8217;ll go with that whole benefit of the doubt thing &mdash; not so much because I believe in the good of people but because I really want that pattern to be real and true and put to use for a lawyer. Designed by Rome-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.whiskeymentine.it\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Whiskey &amp; Mentine<\/a>, the identity is like a crazyfabulous zebra print dress with a pattern made out of twisted &#8220;V&#8221;s from the logo. It&#8217;s chic and edgy and sort of inappropriate for a lawyer but I would imagine it would be fierce counsel I would be getting. (For the record, not in love with the AVB monogram). <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/19456545\/AVB\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">LAmobile by Vova Lifanov<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_lamobile1.gif\" alt=\"Lamobile by Vova Lifanov\" style=\"width:50%!important\" \/><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_lamobile2.gif\" alt=\"Lamobile by Vova Lifanov\" style=\"width:50%!important\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/opt.lamobile.ru\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LAmobile<\/a> is a retailer of accessories for mobile phones and digital lifestyle stuff, selling everything from iPhone cases to Beats headphones to those selfie sticks. Now, this isn&#8217;t a great logo and it isn&#8217;t a great identity but, BUT there is a lion with a USB tail and what I think is a smartphone face strutting on your screen. How awesome is that? Maybe in the annals of awesome not so awesome but look at it! When science is advanced enough to create one of these I&#8217;m so adopting one. The rest of the work at Moscow-based <a href=\"http:\/\/urobarbos.com\/projects\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Vova Lifanov&#8217;s site<\/a> is pretty trippy and worth a look too. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/19676481\/Lamobile\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project here<\/strong><\/a><\/strong>.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"We&apos;ve got color, we&apos;ve got patterns, we&apos;ve got mobile felines in today&apos;s Friday Likes, with work from Toronto, Rome, and Moscow&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[230,40,769],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3539"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3539"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3539\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3539"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3539"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3539"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
