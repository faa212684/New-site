Milan<\/a> is one of the most popular and successful football teams not just in Italy but abroad. Among its accolades are 18 titles in Serie A, the top league of Italian football, and 18 combined FIFA and UEFA trophies for continental and international competitions. A.C. Milan plays their home games in San Siro, aka Stadio Giuseppe Meazza, the largest stadium in Italy, with a capacity of 80,000 people. Recently, the team introduced a new identity designed by London, UK-based <a href=\"https:\/\/dixonbaxi.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DixonBaxi<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>The identity celebrates the club&#8217;s iconic badge as a symbol of unity &#8211; a beating heart that connects millions. Fans and footballing gods have been kissing the club&#8217;s famous badge for a century. Respecting this heritage, we left the design untouched and used the iconic oval shape to tell powerful stories.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/dixonbaxi.com\/work\/acmilan\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DixonBaxi project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ac_milan_badge_intro.jpg\" alt=\"New Identity for A.C.

It&#8217;s also a way of implying that they don&#8217;t need to pull <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/new_logo_and_identity_for_juventus_by_interbrand.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a Juventus<\/a> and change their logo dramatically to something more commercial and can instead build on the team&#8217;s heritage. Nonetheless, I would have <em>loved<\/em> to see some technical improvements to it. Nonetheless to the previous nonetheless, the either client-imposed or self-imposed limitation on the badge update led to a great new visual language that amplifies the equity of the shape.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ac_milan_ovals.jpg\" alt=\"New Identity for A.C. Milan by DixonBaxi\" \/>\n<figcaption>Oval-based visual language.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>Inspired by this illustrious past but focused on future glory, we designed an AC Milan for a new, diverse generation of proud Rossoneri. Confident yet refined, the graphic language balances elegance and passion. Equally at home online, in the San Siro or plastered across the city, the consistent graphic language gives the club a strong voice to connect with fans.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/dixonbaxi.com\/work\/acmilan\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DixonBaxi project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ac_milan_ovals_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Identity for A.C.

Milan custom typeface &#8212; I am not sure exactly how long it has been in use &#8212; DixonBaxi has devised a great system built literally around the oval in a way that feels classic (as in inscriptions on stone) and contemporary. I personally dislike the existing custom typeface and I am amazed that they were able to make it look good. Even the treatment where words go from small to big to small to form an oval, which exposes the awkwardness of the typeface, manages to look quite nice, but the best treat in this is when the type is smaller, set along the oval, and layered with player contours.<\/p>\n<blockquote>Introducing a dynamic new typeface inspired by the shared heartbeat of our fans.<br \/><br \/>Taking cues from fashion, lifestyle brands and Italian culture, we created a bold yet elegant typographic system. Instantly recognisable, it captures the passion Milan fans have for their club.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/dixonbaxi.com\/work\/acmilan\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DixonBaxi project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ac_milan_custom_font_01.png\" alt=\"New Identity for A.C.
