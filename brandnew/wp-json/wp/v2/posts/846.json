We are launching a new brand with a new approach of treating customers with total transparency,&#8221; states Chief Executive Officer Al de Molina. Either Mr. de Molina is confused about the definition of the word transparency, or he is simply lying; either way consumers are being duped by this &#8220;launch.&#8221; The &#8220;groundbreaking, disruptive philosophy&#8221; at the heart of the new brand is the mastermind of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gmacfs.com\/us\/en\/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GMAC Financial Services,<\/a> the 90-year-old holding company that created Ally. The new bank states that they &#8220;will not bait and switch depositors;&#8221; in fact they are doing exactly that. Ally is simply a tactical, albeit clever, name change for the older, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.coyoteblog.com\/coyote_blog\/2009\/01\/can-you-say-moral-hazard.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">less reputable<\/a> bank.

While the new identity is certainly an improvement, sadly, it seems the holding company&#8217;s values have remained intact. &#8220;Given the recent financial market turmoil, people are looking for a safe, honest and efficient place to save and grow their money.&#8221; Perhaps, in a truly concerted effort to be &#8220;honest,&#8221; GMAC should rethink the use of the word &#8220;honest.&#8221;<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,37,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/846"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=846"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/846\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=846"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=846"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=846"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
