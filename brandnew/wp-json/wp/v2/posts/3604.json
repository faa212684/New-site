Designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kindnorway.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kind<\/a> as a single shape, the three letters come together beautifully as a triple ligature that also works as an ambigram. The wordmark is elegant, sophisticated, and contemporary and looks great on everything from an apron to a wooden sign to silkscreened on a growler without any need of additional doodads or visual decoration, letting the materials chosen for the production convey the warmth and craftiness of the restaurant&#8217;s ambiance. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kindnorway.com\/work?category=1&#038;client=11\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">E-MINI by Studio Newwork<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_emini.jpg\" alt=\"E-MINI by Studio Newwork\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">Based in Brazil, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.e-mini.com.br\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">E-MINI<\/a> is a curated online store of clothing and toys for 0- to 4-year-old kids, bringing together over 20 different brands that all share a high quotient of adorable. Its identity has been designed by New York-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.studionewwork.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Studio Newwork<\/a> and features a wonderful, Optima-esque wordmark that adds a touch of elegance to the aforementioned adorable quotient. The twist, almost literally, to the wordmark comes in the subtle curvature created in the diagonal strokes of the &#8220;M&#8221; and &#8220;N&#8221;. In application, the wordmark can be used more seriously as in the stationery or it can be playfully broken apart and spread like confetti. The multi-line version is also excellent, adding up to an identity that elevates the value of really tiny shoes, hats, and t-shirts. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/4859251\/E-MINI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Caf&eacute; Royal by Pentagram<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_caferoyal.jpg\" alt=\"Caf&eacute; Royal by Pentagram\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">A 5-star, luxury hotel in central London <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hotelcaferoyal.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Caf&eacute; Royal<\/a> is one of three European hotels that make up <a href=\"http:\/\/thesethotels.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Set<\/a>, which all share being located in existing landmark buildings.
