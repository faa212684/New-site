While the new name alone warranted an identity change, the old logo was in the most dire need of an update. With a process that started in March of 2009, a new identity designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cundari.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cundari<\/a> was unveiled this past February.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>The three folding forms represent open books &mdash; classic symbols of education and learning. They also reflect open doors &mdash; suggestive of possibilities, opportunities and access to higher education, all core principles of Mount Royal University. In conjunction, the three forms unite to present the letter &#8220;M&#8221;, representative of Mount Royal, and its integrated academic community of students, faculty and staff. Coming together, the three forms also create a subtle maple leaf form, denoting the strong Canadian legacy, profile and aspiration of Mount Royal University &mdash; our past, present and future.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mtroyal.ca\/wcm\/groups\/public\/documents\/content\/ssdata_logoguidelinesfeb2010.pdf\">Identity Guidelines<\/a> [PDF]<\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mount_royal_uni_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"Mount Royal University\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The new icon is remarkably nice, and it surprisingly works on all the levels above without much pretense or by requiring a big stretch of the imagination. It manages to look, strong, reputable and even, well, Canadian without being Maple-Leaf-Red. Where most universities would have been content to use Trajan, Cundari must be thanked too for heeding the call and using the rich man&#8217;s Trajan, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.typography.com\/fonts\/font_overview.php?productLineID=100020\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Requiem<\/a> by Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones. The result is twenty-one centuries better. It&#8217;s both reassuring and scary to think that it wasn&#8217;t so easy to arrive at this final logo&hellip; 91 logos!<\/p>\n<blockquote>Further research led to the development of 91 logo options, from which a short list of four designs was approved by a Logo Task Force made up of representatives of the President&#8217;s Direct Report Group, University Management Group, Deans&#8217; Council, and the four divisions at Mount Royal &mdash; Student Affairs and Campus Life, Administrative Services, Academic Affairs and University Advancement.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mtroyal.ca\/AboutMountRoyal\/FacetoFace\/TheMountRoyalBrand\/FAQs\/FAQnewLogo.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Logo FAQs<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mount_royal_uni_colors.gif\" alt=\"Mount Royal University\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The color palette is also rather pleasant, even if a little on the cold side. The logo works really well in one color and I very much like the unexpected use of the lighter shade as a transparent effect. I&#8217;m also a sucker for logos that pattern well, and this one patterns better than most Winter Olympic logos.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mount_royal_uni_pattern_01.gif\" alt=\"Mount Royal University\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mount_royal_uni_pattern_02.gif\" alt=\"Mount Royal University\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to Rebecca Hirsekorn for the tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_100325_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_100325_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_100325_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_100325_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,29,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1060"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1060"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1060\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1060"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1060"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1060"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
