Fittingly, the hyphen in TMA-2 is a symbol of connecting parts, i.e. words. Moreover, in ancient Greek it means &#8216;together.&#8217;<br \/><br \/>Consequently, a minimal yet playful, visual grid and pattern was applied on the box and the product part bags, resulting in a typographic concept that includes variations and the ability to evolve.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/kilodesign.dk\/closer-tma-2-modular-packaging-system-designed-kilo-aiaiai-3\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kilo project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tma2_aiaiai_animation.gif\" alt=\"New Packaging for AIAIAI&amp;apos;s TMA-2 done In-house and by Kilo\" \/>\n<figcaption>Grid and flexibility.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/155392836?title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Packaging explanation. Pardon the robotic voiceover.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Hyphens, monospace fonts, and grids aren&#8217;t the most novel of graphic devices so it&#8217;s hard to take those basic elements and create something exciting, which is what makes this packaging system so great: the elements are as plain as it gets but their combination and execution is excellent and perfect for the product. The grid of hyphens can adapt to the different sizes of the bags, the box, and any other applications, and as long as they are not trying to spell Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious they will always have room to typeset any product category. I also like that the product categories are very loose in the direction in which they read: left to right as in HEADBAND or top to bottom as in EAR PADS.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tma2_aiaiai_packaging_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for AIAIAI&amp;apos;s TMA-2 done In-house and by Kilo\" \/>\n<figcaption>Boxes and accessories.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tma2_aiaiai_packaging_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for AIAIAI&amp;apos;s TMA-2 done In-house and by Kilo\" \/>\n<figcaption>Accessories detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tma2_aiaiai_packaging_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for AIAIAI&amp;apos;s TMA-2 done In-house and by Kilo\" \/>\n<figcaption>Accessories. &#8220;The stickers have no set placement, and are placed on the grid in different positions, which multiplies the number of potential &#8216;unique&#8217; or different pieces of packaging options for the consumer.&#8221;<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tma2_aiaiai_packaging_04.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for AIAIAI&amp;apos;s TMA-2 done In-house and by Kilo\" \/>\n<figcaption>Box&#8217;s lid release button.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">The materials are also a wonderful choice, in particular the gray plastic bags that allow for contrast with both the black box and the white stickers, all with a lovely matte finish. This is a package that rivals any of Apple&#8217;s and one-ups them with a dose of actual personality. If I were in the market for a $200 headphone set I would buy this on the packaging alone.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 2006, AIAIAI is an audio design company based in Copenhagen, Denmark, and specializes in headphones.
