To tide you over for the end of the month here are three juicy bits, two of them involving funny business practices, and not funny-ha-ha.<\/p><!--more--><p><span class=\"red\"><strong>1. India Design Mark<\/strong><\/span><br \/>An initiative of the India Design Council (IDC), the &#8220;I-Mark&#8221; is meant to be a seal of approval for all things well designed in India. The IDC held a, of course, contest to design the mark but what was most appalling about it was the timeline: a single week for submissions. The final ten selections all came from the same designer, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/album.php?aid=56907&#038;id=199094223436101\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">you can see them here<\/a>. <a href=\"http:\/\/littledesignbook.in\/2011\/03\/a-mark-of-quality\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A winner was selected<\/a> but soon after, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ahmedabadmirror.com\/printarticle.aspx?page=comments&#038;action=translate&#038;sectid=3&#038;contentid=201103182011031802460289239ceba43&#038;subsite=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">with protests from the design community<\/a>, the IDC scrapped the winning entry and will be launching the contest again. Not a win-win, but at least it&#8217;s a start.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to Sanjay Basavaraju for the tip.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"red\"><strong>2. Home Depot?<\/strong><\/span><br \/>Making the rounds on Twitter this week is an image indicating a possible rebrand of Home Depot. Snapped by <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/grokstar\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@grokstar<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/twitpic.com\/4c4r2k\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this picture<\/a> shows a checkout machine with a new logo, which seems like the perfect place to start testing consumer reactions, it beats changing the logo on the front of the store. One of my tipsters sent in another image that confirms some implementation, or at least some testing, is being done with <a href=\"http:\/\/img577.imageshack.us\/img577\/3438\/l875034.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">new aisle signs sporting what looks like a stencil version of Memphis<\/a>. As soon as there is something more official, you know we&#8217;ll get you the goods.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to Twitter and anonymous for the tips.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"red\"><strong>3. UK Prime Minister Advocates 99designs.com<\/strong><\/span><br \/>In the home page of <a href=\"http:\/\/startupbritain.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">StartUp Britain<\/a>, &#8220;a new campaign by entrepreneurs for entrepreneurs, launched on 28th March 2011. Designed to celebrate, inspire and accelerate enterprise in the UK, it has the full backing of the Prime Minister, the Chancellor and HM Government.&#8221; there are four Top Tips to start a business, the fourth one being Create a Logo. So what does the Prime Minister recommend? 99designs.com! Again, the community protested and, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.creativereview.co.uk\/cr-blog\/2011\/march\/startup-cock-up\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">thanks in part to some <em>Creative Review<\/em> muscle<\/a> the recommendation has been changed to contact the Design Business Association.
