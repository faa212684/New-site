A 1970s building on the banks of the Amstel river has been renovated by WPP&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bdg-a-d.com\/amsterdam-landmark\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BDG<\/a> and now serves as a 204,000-square-foot campus for 1,500 employees. Maintaining the original box-stacked structure, the building has renovated roof terraces, restaurants, a rooftop bar, a business lounge, an event space, and a range of co-working, conference, and hospitality spaces. The identity and signage for Amsteldok has been designed by WPP&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vbat.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">VBAT<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>We named the campus Amsteldok. Its name references the campus&#8217;s location on the banks of the Amstel River, Amsterdam&#8217;s maritime history and the city&#8217;s current status as an important gateway to Europe. We wanted a logotype that was directly inspired by the physical structure and found the Amsterdam School of Architecture &#8211; an expressive 20th century style predominant throughout the city &#8211; an important inspiration for our typographic forms. We envisioned a dynamic logotype that mimicked the campus&#8217;s urban verticality, and a graphic language that fully embraced the campus strategy as a &#8216;breathing space that breaks down walls&#8217;. Responsible for all physical and digital environments, we were in a unique position to use design to bring all 15 WPP agencies together. Design would contribute to the campus as a living entity, not just another staid structure. A campus that breathes creativity and collaboration.<\/blockquote><h3>VBAT provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/345472741?title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"360\" height=\"203\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Identity presentation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>I usually put the summary video presentations at the end but this time I think it helps to see the concept and animations upfront.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/amsteldok_references.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Amsteldok by VBAT\" \/>\n<figcaption>References.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The logotype was created by initially experimenting with the letter proportions, while maintaining the core essence of the mark.

Between VBAT and Fontsmith, they were able to maintain the quirkiness, clunkiness, and charm of the original points of reference and transfer them into a modular, expandable logo and type system for modern-day applications. I probably would have even been satisfied with the static, full-justified version of the logo alone and if it had been repeated ad nauseam in the applications because it&#8217;s such a unique set of characters in a tight, bold composition. The variable extensions add layers of welcome whimsy and useful flexibility that have spurred some playful applications.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/amsteldok_logo_animation.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Amsteldok by VBAT\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sample animation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/amsteldok_responsive_logo_animation.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Amsteldok by VBAT\" \/>\n<figcaption>Animation responding to movement.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/amsteldok_typeface.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Amsteldok by VBAT\" \/>\n<figcaption>Type family.

The logotype also functions as a template for all online\/digital programming and communication &#8211; from digital posters, announcements and social events (speakers&#8217; programs). The colour palette was also directly derived from the architectural materials used by the architects. Wayfinding was an integral part of the spatial experience. We designed playful wayfinding icons that reflect familiar Dutch things &#8211; bike icons that look like the ones you find on Amsterdam streets, glass icons in the shape of Heineken glasses, etc. All these elements contribute to a real campus identity and unite 15 radically different WPP agencies as a single whole.<\/blockquote><h3>VBAT provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/amsteldok_business_cards.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Amsteldok by VBAT\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/amsteldok_posters.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Amsteldok by VBAT\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/amsteldok_posters_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Amsteldok by VBAT\" \/>\n<figcaption>Posters.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/amsteldok_brochure.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Amsteldok by VBAT\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brochure.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/amsteldok_button.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Amsteldok by VBAT\" \/>\n<figcaption>Button.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/amsteldok_tote.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Amsteldok by VBAT\" \/>\n<figcaption>Tote.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The print applications are good and fun, making the most out of the stretchiness of the type &#8212; perhaps sometimes taking it a little too far (like, I&#8217;m not sure about that &#8220;RADIO&#8221; type a few scrolls above) &#8212; and pairing it with Fontsmith&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fontsmith.com\/fonts\/fs-industrie\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FS Industrie<\/a>. The only thing I would question is the color palette which is all over the place.
