The logo, designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.frostcollective.com.au\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Frost*<\/a>, comes in two flavors: the first, as a straightforward chunky serif stencil wordmark that is elegant and upscale but not necessarily inspiring; and the second, is where things turn for the best, when all the loose pieces of the stencil wordmark are jumbled and rearranged to form a circle that looks like a pizza and its toppings. It&#8217;s a playful complement to the main wordmark and works as a nice payoff for any customer paying attention. The circle logo is particularly convincing printed on top of the boxes where it looks like the pizza you are about to dig into. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.frostcollective.com.au\/projects\/something-new-something-different\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Hotel Convento do Salvador by Uma<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_conventodosalvador.jpg\" alt=\"Hotel Convento do Salvador by Uma\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.booking.com\/hotel\/pt\/convento-do-salvador-lisboa.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hotel Convento do Salvador<\/a> is a 43-room hotel housed in an old convent in the historical neighborhood of Alfama in Lisbon, Portugal, and it looks like a perfect blend of old and new. Inspired by the tightly-packed houses of the historic center where it sits, local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.uma-studio.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Uma<\/a> cobbled together an &#8220;H&#8221; made out of the most basic and iconic shapes of the surrounding houses.  I love the asymmetry of the &#8220;H&#8221; and how it manages to convey the feeling of houses one on top of the other while keeping a charming vibe through the brick color seen on the shingles of these houses. The applications are basic and maybe a little shy but allow the logo stand out. The front door sign alone, though, shows less is more. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.uma-studio.com\/work\/hotelcs\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Super Sila by Denis Bashev and Alex Mamontov<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_supersila.jpg\" alt=\"Super Sila by Denis Bashev and Alex Mamontov\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/supersilagames.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Super Sila<\/a> is a mobile game developer in Moscow with an unapologetically scaling logo designed by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/didierbashev\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Denis Bashev<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/AlexMamontov\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Alex Mamontov<\/a> as a playful response to all those logos whose standards prohibit you from scaling them unproportionately. Based on a pixel wordmark, the goal of the logo is to cover every layout from corner to corner, legibility be damned. Based on UnderConsideration&#8217;s logo you might infer that I really dig this approach ; ) The effect can be well appreciated on Super Sila&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/supersilagames\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Facebook page<\/a> where the profile and cover pictures are the same logo stretched to fit in those boxes. The print applications shown are probably renders but, still, really like them for their boldness and in-your-face-ness. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/26991435\/SUPERSILA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"A range of playful logos with different approaches today, with work from Sydney, Lisbon, and Moscow&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[764,633,762,564],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4522"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4522"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4522\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4522"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4522"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4522"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
