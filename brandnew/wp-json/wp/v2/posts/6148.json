I don&#8217;t have a lot more information because my Ukrainian is a little rusty.

They were fine, to be honest, nothing terrible and nothing great. The new monogram presents the most evident change, going with a more stylized &#8220;\u0427&#8221; &#8212; the Cyrillic letter for the &#8220;ch&#8221; sound &#8212; that sits inside a guitar-pick-like shield. It&#8217;s relatively attractive but the gold contour of the shield is a little awkward. The full wordmark now features a contrasting, thick-thin type structure that somehow feels very un-beer-like and more spirit-like, like something you would see on a Vodka bottle.<\/p>\n<p>The main logo can also be accompanied by a range of English stuff, including a &#8220;Since 1988&#8221;, the name of the beer rendered as a signature, a &#8220;Brewed with Passion&#8221; tagline, and a monogram seal. Maybe, it&#8217;s a little too much but even if it were the right amount of stuff, maybe it&#8217;s one (or two or three) too many styles. I&#8217;ll admit that I do dig the signature execution a lot.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/chernigivske_bottle_before_after_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Chernigivske by Reynolds and Reyner\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/chernigivske_bottle_before_after_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Chernigivske by Reynolds and Reyner\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/chernigivske_bottle_before_after_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Chernigivske by Reynolds and Reyner\" \/>\n<figcaption>Before and after of a few of Chernigivske&#8217;s beers.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/chernigivske_bottle_detail.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Chernigivske by Reynolds and Reyner\" \/>\n<figcaption>New bottle.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old bottle labels were fine &#8212; other than the many green &#8220;eko&#8221; marks &#8212; and the thick borders with the pattern were actually pretty cool. The new labels feel a lot slicker for sure and more contemporary. There is a lot of detailing and subtle elements and textures that make them interesting but the overall look feels a little forced in trying to make the beer more premium.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/chernigivske_bottle_detail_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Chernigivske by Reynolds and Reyner\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/chernigivske_bottle_detail_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Chernigivske by Reynolds and Reyner\" \/>\n<figcaption>Bottle details.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/chernigivske_identity_element.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Chernigivske by Reynolds and Reyner\" \/>\n<figcaption>Monogram on steroids.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/chernigivske_identity_element_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Chernigivske by Reynolds and Reyner\" \/>\n<figcaption>Various lock-ups of stuff.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/chernigivske_cases.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Chernigivske by Reynolds and Reyner\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/chernigivske_cases_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Chernigivske by Reynolds and Reyner\" \/>\n<figcaption>Cases.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The cases introduce a range of identity elements that are a little dizzying.

These silhouettes work rather nicely with the typographic arrangements and the image directly above has a cool contrasting effect between the graphic bottle and photographic background.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/chernigivske_tshirts.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Chernigivske by Reynolds and Reyner\" \/>\n<figcaption>T-shirts.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">Overall, the change is good, I guess, in that it elevates the beer to more of a lifestyle brand as opposed to a beer-that&#8217;s-most-widely-available-so-I-guess-we&#8217;ll-drink-that brand.
