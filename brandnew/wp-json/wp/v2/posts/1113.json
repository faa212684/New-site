Even more so when it comes to a game developer that enabled many hours of personal enjoyment with games like the addictive <em><a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Marble_Madness\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Marble Madness<\/a><\/em> or one of the earlier basketball games, <em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/jordan-vs-bird-one-on-one\/61-16685\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jordan vs. Bird: One-on-One<\/a><\/em>. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rare.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rare<\/a> is a British company that has been a big part of the development of the gaming industry since the late 1970s, when it produced 8-bit games and has since developed games for all the major consoles. Rare was bought by Microsoft in 2002. Yesterday, as part of their 25th anniversary, Rare announced a new look.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>Now, as the company focuses its vision on an even more exhilarating future, the timing is perfect to introduce a distinctive new look. So Rare is thrilled to unveil its new identity, encompassing a brand new logo and branding soon to be extended to a full website relaunch at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rare.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">www.rare.co.uk<\/a>.<br \/><br \/>The new logo is both modern and classic, adjectives that could be applied equally well to Rare itself.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rare.co.uk\/company\/press-rebrand.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press Release<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/rare_logo_detail_a.gif\" alt=\"Rare\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/rare_logo_detail_b.gif\" alt=\"Rare\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/rare_logo_detail_c.gif\" alt=\"Rare\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/rare_logo_detail_d.gif\" alt=\"Rare\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The new look, smartly, does not throw away all of its equity, keeping the signature abstract &#8220;R&#8221; alive but changing its size relationship to the wordmark. The new typography has that spare Avenir-esque look that was all the rage in the UK a few years ago and it works fairly well here, although I wonder if it&#8217;s too conservative for such a progressive company. The new logo comes in a few different geometric flavors, with the &#8220;R&#8221; being held in different colored shapes; it&#8217;s not a groundbreaking idea, but it also seems to work fairly well here. Same question applies: Is this <em>rare<\/em> enough? By looking at the identity the company might as well be called Normal.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.christhorpe.net\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Chris Thorpe<\/a> for first tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_100603_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_100603_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_100603_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_100603_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,66,26],"tags":[181,105,182,42],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1113"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1113"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1113\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1113"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1113"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1113"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
