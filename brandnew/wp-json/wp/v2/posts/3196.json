UP is the first reduced-fare, a la carte-service in Israel and they face the challenge of explaining the pricing model to their audience who is accustomed to the full-service of El Al and of establishing a distinct low-cost look-and-feel that is different yet related to the parent airline and the trust associated with it. UP&#8217;s new identity has been designed by Tel-Aviv-based <a href=\"http:\/\/english.open.co.il\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Open<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>We positioned UP as &#8220;Low Fare Flights by EL-AL&#8221; (endorsed brand), to promote preference yet differentiate it from other low-cost players. The brand promise, &#8220;The choice is yours&#8221;, reflects the &#8220;low cost&#8221; benefit and answers the need for lunching an unfamiliar price concept.<br \/><br \/>The brand identity is based on an independent identity alongside elements designed to create affinity to EL-AL. The identity relies on one dominant color, uses clouds as a strong, simple symbol and icons exemplifying the price components. The name &#8220;UP&#8221;, insinuates EL-AL&#8217;s Hebrew meaning [&#8220;To the Skies&#8221;]. For further brand affinity, we placed the Israeli flag on the plane&#8217;s tail.<\/blockquote><h3>Text from Brand New Awards submission<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/up_by_elal_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for UP by Open\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The logo is charming. I like a good, solid, well-formed cloud and this is a pretty straightforward rendition that nicely houses the condensed, italic UP name and the El Al endorsing line. Although perhaps there is a tad too much space left on the right side of the cloud. My main complaint would be that the cloud inside the &#8220;P&#8221; is the same as the outer cloud: it doesn&#8217;t take too much effort to vary cloud shapes so it would have been nice to avoid the repetition. But, as a unit, the logo has a very visible presence and a welcome, friendly quality.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/up_by_elal_livery.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for UP by Open\" \/>\n<figcaption>Livery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/88747802\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Painting the livery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The plane is so much fun too.

It might start to get a little repetitive after a few years but as a way to enter the market and establish a friendly, accessible personality, this succeeds in cumulus levels.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Announced in late 2013 and beginning operations this March, UP is the new low-cost airline of Israel &mdash; owned by El Al, the country&#8217;s flag carrier &mdash; offering a selection of flights to Berlin, Budapest, Kiev, Prague, and Larnaca.
