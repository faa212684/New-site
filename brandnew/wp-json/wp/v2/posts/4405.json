The change was as simple as it gets, trading a serif wordmark for a sans serif wordmark. A lot of people called it childish, boring, and a mistake. I don&#8217;t usually make this kind of statement &mdash; okay, maybe I do &mdash; but all those people are wrong. Google has never looked as sharp, confident, approachable, and well-designed as it does today. The new logo and accompanying identity looks flawless on the myriad screens and platforms it lives on, including some snazzy new TV ads. To me, not only was this the most notable identity of the year but the best &mdash; especially for a company operating at such high stakes and under so much scrutiny. <\/p>\n<\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"For this year&#8217;s multi-part summary &mdash; there will be 6 parts &mdash; I am introducing a new category: The Most Notable projects Reviewed.
