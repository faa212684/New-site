Paring down many of the logo&#8217;s excess shapes doesn&#8217;t just make the logo dramatically simpler, it also becomes far more balanced to look at.<br \/><br \/>We also used the logo as metaphor, referencing what&#8217;s at the core of Engadget&#8217;s world: the personal technology devices we use today. Just about every device in the world has the same thing in common: a screen with hard edges enclosed in a body with soft, human-safe corners. This metaphor of machine and man &mdash; hard and soft &mdash; informs the smooth corners and the sharply sculpted negative spaces of our letters.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.engadget.com\/2013\/11\/15\/engadget-redesign\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Engadget blog post<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/engadget_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo for Engadget by Gino Reyes\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo and icon detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/engagdet_logo_structure.png\" alt=\"New Logo for Engadget by Gino Reyes\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo grid.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/engadget_hinted_icon.png\" alt=\"New Logo for Engadget by Gino Reyes\" \/>\n<figcaption>Pixel-hinted icon at different sizes for sharp resolution.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/engadget_hinted_logos.png\" alt=\"New Logo for Engadget by Gino Reyes\" \/>\n<figcaption>Pixel-hinted logo at different sizes for sharp resolution.

Engadget&#8217;s old logo was a perfectly acceptable wordmark for a tech blog: it had futuristic-looking letters and an obligatory wi-fi-like signal. Greatest blog logo ever? No, not really. The new logo is far more ambitious in establishing a distinctive aesthetic. It&#8217;s no longer just a stock typeface but a custom-drawn set of characters that have a better relation to each other. The angular and grid-based approach exude a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=wim+crouwel+new+alphabet&#038;source=lnms&#038;tbm=isch&#038;sa=X&#038;ei=PaOMUrqbAu2isAScnIGwBA&#038;ved=0CAkQ_AUoAQ&#038;biw=1353&#038;bih=910\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wim Crouwel New Alphabet vibe<\/a> that is quite welcome. The wordmark&#8217;s rhythm is much improved and its best quality is how good (and readable) it looks small. Is it now the best blog logo ever? Still not, but it certainly raises the bar.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Launched in 2004, Engadget is one of the leading and most widely read tech blogs featuring news, reviews, and opinions with &quot;obsessive coverage of cutting edge gadgets, consumer electronics and the science and technology they&apos;re built upon.&quot; Owned by AOL&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,82,26],"tags":[292,108,148],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2850"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2850"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2850\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2850"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2850"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2850"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
