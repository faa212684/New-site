Forgottern Boardwalk offers three year-round\nbeers along with a number of seasonal and special offerings, available in cans\nor on tap at the tasting room, which has its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forgottenboardwalk.com\/gallery\/curious-brewery-refuge-forgotten-boardwalk-brewing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">own set of skee ball machines and fun house mirrors<\/a>. The\nidentity and packaging for the brewery were designed by Nashville, TN-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.perkybros.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Perky Bros<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>The identity brings to life the stories of sideshow oddities, historic events and darker side of the boardwalk&#8217;s past, while filtering it through a quirky, yet restrained visual lens. The packaging&#8217;s design and minimal palette creates a clear and inviting presence on the typically cluttered retail shelf. The brand mascot, inspired by the feral cats living underneath the boardwalk, narrates our pretty true &#8220;tails&#8221; as well as serves as a consistent visual thread from logo to the beer taps.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.perkybros.com\/portfolio\/forgotten-boardwalk-brewing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Perky Bros project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/forgotten_boardwalk_wordmark.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Forgotten Boardwalk Brewing by Perky Bros\" \/>\n<figcaption>Wordmark detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/forgotten_boardwalk_icon.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Forgotten Boardwalk Brewing by Perky Bros\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icon detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The identity revolves around the folklore and oddities of the boardwalk, with the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=jersey+shore+boardwalk+cats&#038;source=lnms&#038;tbm=isch&#038;sa=X&#038;ved=0ahUKEwjawry2j9nLAhUD6iYKHSy3BcwQ_AUIBygB&#038;biw=1621&#038;bih=866\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">feral cats living under it<\/a> as the centerpiece. Mix in a little gypsy-circus-bearded-lady aesthetic and you get this identity. The three-eyed, harlequin-dressed cat has a great can&#8217;t-look-away creepy vibe that makes for a wonderfully eccentric mascot. The illustration style is perfect and the execution is spot on. The wordmark is set in a dangerously sharp serif that looks just as crisp set straight as it does on a curve. Like the boardwalk&#8217;s folklore, the logo is a wonderful oddity, particularly against today&#8217;s minimalist-slash-industrial micro brewery trend.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/forgotten_boardwalk_business_cards.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Forgotten Boardwalk Brewing by Perky Bros\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/forgotten_boardwalk_business_cards_detail.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Forgotten Boardwalk Brewing by Perky Bros\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business card detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/forgotten_boardwalk_coasters.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Forgotten Boardwalk Brewing by Perky Bros\" \/>\n<figcaption>Coasters.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>How sweet are those business cards with all the information typeset on a curve?

The minimal illustrations are adorned with what I&#8217;ll call Shitty Stipple style (meant as a compliment) that gives them a cool, amateur aesthetic. The typography on all the cans is perfect &#8212; typeset in what looks to be Neutraface Condensed &#8212; and playful.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/forgotten_boardwalk_growler.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Forgotten Boardwalk Brewing by Perky Bros\" \/>\n<figcaption>Growlers.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/forgotten_boardwalk_tap_handle.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Forgotten Boardwalk Brewing by Perky Bros\" \/>\n<figcaption>Tap handle.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/forgotten_boardwalk_tshirts.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Forgotten Boardwalk Brewing by Perky Bros\" \/>\n<figcaption>T-shirts.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">Overall, this was clearly fun to work on and there was no shortage of ideas and source material to exploit as well as a client committed to producing a quality product with a great visual narrative around it.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Opened last year, Forgotten Boardwalk Brewing is a micro brewery in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, started by home brewer Jamie Quel, who grew up around the Jersey Shore and frequented its famous boardwalk (and others along the state), leading to&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[51,12,26],"tags":[1122,39,53,1256,33],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4581"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4581"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4581\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4581"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4581"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4581"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
