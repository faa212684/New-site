In the meantime, and gearing up for the momentous event, the AGO unveiled last week a new logo designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.brucemaudesign.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bruce Mau Design<\/a>, who also designed the previous iteration of the logo in 1997.<\/p><!--more--><p>The new logo comes saddled with too many metaphors and stretching of the imagination:<\/p>\n<blockquote>&#8220;The Art Gallery of Ontario is relaunching with a renewed mission to bring art and people together with experiences and spaces that are dynamic yet timeless, popular yet iconic. The new logo is similarly imbued with fluid motion and spontaneity, counterbalanced by stability and legibility.&#8221;<br \/>&mdash; Bruce Mau<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>&#8220;Centered inside a black square, the Gallery&#8217;s new logo uses multiple typefaces and a wide spectrum of colours to create a unique effect reminiscent of light refracting through glass. By combining a strong iconic form &mdash; the black square &mdash; with a shimmering juxtaposition of overlapping coloured typefaces, the logo captures both the stability of the century-old institution and the forward-looking energy of the new Gallery.&#8221;<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ago.net\/info\/ago_news\/2008-05-15\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press Release<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p>I had always been smitten with the previous logo and considered it a daring and challenging identity that defied the conventions of traditional museum and gallery identities at that level. The use of color was extraordinary and generated an innate vibrancy that the &#8220;shimmering&#8221; colors and typefaces of the new one could only dream of achieving. The colors of the new one are not nearly as sophisticated as the previous one and feel as completely random choices hoping that the excess will be the main focus. The resulting forms, both the white and the colored bits &mdash; awfully accentuated, by the way, on the clumsy animation on the AGO&#8217;s home page &mdash; are not pleasing and seem to want to take more attention than the museum itself and the collection within it. Even if the idea were strong, the execution does not convey anything beyond the crazed application of the &#8220;Pathfinder&#8221; tool in Adobe Illustrator. An odd step backwards from an institution that is clearly moving forward. <\/p>\n<p>For a few more details about this identity, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.artmatters.ca\/blog\/index.php?\/archives\/173-AGO-announces-new-graphic-identity-A-conversation-with-Matthew-Teitelbaum.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">please visit this page<\/a>, which has a link to a podcast discussing the work.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Thank you to everyone that wrote in on Friday with the tip.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,63,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/636"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=636"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/636\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=636"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=636"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=636"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
