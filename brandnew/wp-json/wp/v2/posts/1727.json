Today, it is one of the largest foodservice distributors to restaurants, healthcare and hospitality facilities, government operations and educational institutions. They offer more than 350,000 brand products, deployed by about 25,000 employees through a fleet of 4,949 tractors, 333 trucks and vans, and 6,333 trailers according to <em>Transport Topics<\/em>&#8216; <a href=\"http:\/\/progressive2.acs.playstream.com\/truckline\/progressive\/TT00pc2011.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Top 100 Private Carrier report [PDF]<\/a>, which lists it at number 5. This past September U.S. Foodservice announced it would change its name to <a href=\"http:\/\/usfoods.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">US Foods<\/a> and introduced a new logo.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>Based on extensive research, the new identity and underlying strategy mark the beginning of US Foods&#8217; strategic transformation into a more creative and innovative food company dedicated to making things easier for customers.<br \/><br \/>In addition to changing its name to US Foods&#8211;which research showed is how most customers and employees already refer to the company&#8211;a new logo and tagline will begin appearing on trucks, products and in other areas. With vibrant orange and green food colors and a bold, simple design, the new image expresses confidence and a fresh outlook.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/usfoods.com\/AboutUs\/Media\/PressReleases\/2011\/NewsRelease_20110926.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press Release<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p>If you spend any time outside or on the road, you&#8217;ve probably seen the old logo passing by or backing up into a grocery store. The old logo, supersized on the side of a truck, is hard to miss and, to be honest, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s that bad, despite the overtly calligraphic texture it has. The new logo looks like a bad government program trying to get the population to eat more veggies. The hues of the colors chosen aren&#8217;t particularly appetizing and someone should have told the designer that when you hit minus 200 in the tracking values you probably better stop. That typesetting is tight. The period is also very confusing, reading as &#8220;Us. Foods.&#8221; &mdash; &#8220;Tarzan. Hungry.&#8221;, &#8220;Jane. Order.&#8221; &mdash; and of the usual punctuation for United States &mdash; US or U.S. &mdash; this is not one of them. It&#8217;s always sad when logos with high visibility get bad redesign jobs because we are the ones who are stuck seeing them all over the place.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to Chad Abbley for the tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_111118_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_111118_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"574\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,76,26],"tags":[42],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1727"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1727"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1727\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1727"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1727"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1727"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
