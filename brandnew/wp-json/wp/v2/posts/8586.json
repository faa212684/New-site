We are building the world&#8217;s most advanced self-driving vehicles to safely connect people to the places, things, and experiences they care about. We believe self-driving cars will help save lives, reimagine cities, redefine time in transit, and restore freedom of movement for many. Backed by some of the world&#8217;s most respected companies like General Motors, SoftBank, Honda, and T. Rowe Price, we operate as a fast-moving startup with deep financial resources. Their backing for our technology demonstrates their confidence in our progress, team, and vision and makes us one of the leading autonomous vehicle organizations in the industry. Our partnership with General Motors enables us to manufacture a fully-integrated self-driving car that is 100% electric, and we believe this approach is crucial to truly solving transportation challenges at global scale.&#8221;<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cruise_car_wordmark_a.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Cruise by Moving Brands and In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Wordmark.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cruise_car_symbol.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Cruise by Moving Brands and In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Symbol.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cruise_car_symbol_crop.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Cruise by Moving Brands and In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sample crop of symbol for applications.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cruise_car_mnemonic.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Symbol animation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video controls controlsList=\"nodownload\" poster=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Cruise_Building_Our_Symbol_hi_res.jpg\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Cruise_Building_Our_Symbol_hi_res.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Symbol construction.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cruise_car_Living_Symbol.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Symbol changing colors.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cruise_car_color_palette.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Cruise by Moving Brands and In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Color palette.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cruise_car_car_01a.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Cruise by Moving Brands and In-house\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cruise_car_car_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Cruise by Moving Brands and In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Cruise car.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cruise_car_car_02_a.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Cruise by Moving Brands and In-house\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<div class=\"video-container\" style=\"padding-bottom: 60.25%;\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cruise_car_car_origin.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Cruise Origin.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"(Est. 2013) &quot;We&apos;re Cruise, a self-driving car service designed for the cities we love.
