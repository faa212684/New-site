Last week, TV Land introduced a new logo and on-air package designed by sixth-year collaborator <a href=\"http:\/\/trollback.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Trollback + Company<\/a> and new mnemonic and theme by <a href=\"http:\/\/cordww.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CORD Worldwide<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tv_land_03_history.gif\" alt=\"TV Land\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Logos introduced in 1996, 2001, and 2009.<\/p>\n<blockquote>For the first time since the launch of the network 16 years ago, TV Land is unveiling a new and re-imagined logo plus re-designed on-air packaging and graphics, it was announced today by Larry W. Jones, president, TV Land. Gone is the logo with a classic TV screen and retro style. Instead, beginning Wednesday, May 9, viewers will see a fresh mark with a nod to the channel&#8217;s roots, a change that reflects the evolution of the network itself.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/s.tt\/1bjqA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TV Land Press Release<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tv_land_03_logo_detail.jpg\" alt=\"TV Land\" \/><\/p>\n<blockquote>The goal for the logo was to lose the retro feeling and make it more modern while maintaining TV Land&#8217;s heritage. Creative Director Anna Minkkinen explains the strategy, &#8220;The new horizontal logo locks up with type neatly, allowing us to constantly reinforce the brand connection between the network and the shows.&#8221;<br \/>&mdash; Trollb&auml;ck + Co Press Release<\/blockquote>\n<p>It fascinates me that TV Land is so attached to the atomic TV shape they have been using for 16 years &mdash; it was memorable and relevant with the channel&#8217;s launch and early evolution but now it&#8217;s just a visage of something that used to make sense. If ever there was a chance to let go, it was now. The shape in the new logo is barely there, now almost unrecognizable if you don&#8217;t know what it is or where it came from. Not only is it <em>not<\/em> gone, it&#8217;s there twice! But let&#8217;s assume the channel&#8217;s viewership and ability to generate well-received scripted series would collapse if the shape wasn&#8217;t there: the logo is okay. &#8220;TV&#8221; sits nicely inside the shape, Gestalt-ingly completing it. Then, &#8220;land&#8221; has grown rather large creating a somewhat strange small caps wordmark that doesn&#8217;t exactly work out, since the thickness of &#8220;land&#8221; is lighter than &#8220;TV&#8221; but not by much, and I wonder why it wasn&#8217;t just equalized. I don&#8217;t think the logo is the successful &#8220;re-imagination&#8221; the releases tout; it simply looks like one more evolution trying to hold on to something that I don&#8217;t think has that much value anymore. Luckily, Trollb&auml;ck + Co has once again done what Trollb&auml;ck + Co does best: develop a catchy, happily contagious on-air package &mdash; I tell you, you could give them the word &#8220;potato&#8221; typeset in Helvetica and they would find a way to package it as the most exciting thing. The new on-air package brings to life the logo and highlights the new cast of characters with a great color scheme and the fun, whistle-y theme. I liked the last on-air system better, but this one still saves the logo too.<\/p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/41850398?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;color=65a2be\" width=\"574\" height=\"323\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">On-air montage. &#8220;The shooting style,&#8221; explains Trollback + Co, &#8220;was also designed to express a fresh, dynamic energy. By using diverse talent shots and juxtaposing punchy imagery, the team was able to set a bold, fun tone against a rich color palette.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tv_land_03_still_01.jpg\" alt=\"TV Land\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tv_land_03_still_02.jpg\" alt=\"TV Land\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tv_land_03_still_03.jpg\" alt=\"TV Land\" \/><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_120517_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_120517_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_120517_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_120517_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[66],"tags":[617,290,189,670],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1969"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1969"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1969\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1969"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1969"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1969"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
