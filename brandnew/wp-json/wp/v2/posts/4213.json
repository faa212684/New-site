(It does). Since 1999, the organization has run a very well-known campaign known simply as &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.thetruth.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">truth&reg;<\/a>&#8221; with very convincing TV spots running on MTV non-stop. Earlier this month, Legacy, as it was known, changed its name to Truth Initiative and introduced a new identity designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.siegelgale.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Siegel+Gale<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/truth_initiative_campaign_logo.png\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Truth Initiative by Siegel+Gale\" \/>\n<figcaption>Well-known campaign logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/c4xmFcrJexk\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>One of the classic truth&reg; commercials.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>&#8220;Along with a new name and story, Siegel+Gale designed an iconic symbol, drawing equity from the truth campaign wordmark, the identity infuses key aspects of the campaign into the organizational brand. Orange was leveraged as a signature color to further link the organization to the campaign. The new identity system builds upon the symbol&#8217;s foundation form of a circle, providing a confident and contemporary visual presence in print, environmental and digital applications.&#8221;<\/blockquote><h3>Siegel+Gale provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/truth_initiative_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Truth Initiative by Siegel+Gale\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/truth_initiative_logo_alternates.png\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Truth Initiative by Siegel+Gale\" \/>\n<figcaption>Secondary logos.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The previous logo was on the lower end of fine in terms of execution but for being the organization behind a hard-hitting campaign it was extremely mellow and looked more like an organization aiming to bring water to rural areas somewhere in the world. There was no sense of urgency to it either. The new logo, with its more active orange color, demands more attention and feels more relevant. The &#8220;t&#8221; monogram is derived directly from the truth&reg; logo, establishing a subtle connection between the two &mdash; for those unaware of the campaign, though, a dotted &#8220;t&#8221; might seem random. The typography is nice enough and the tittles in the &#8220;i&#8221;s of what seems to be Helvetica have been changed to circles to match the icon. I personally wouldn&#8217;t have paired DIN in the tagline with Helvetica but then again I&#8217;m not really a fan of either font.<\/p>\n <figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/truth_initiative_swag.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Truth Initiative by Siegel+Gale\" \/>\n<figcaption>Swag.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">Not much in terms of application: dots and DIN. Come to think of it, that&#8217;s either a nice name for a business or a design firm philosophy. Overall, there is more energy to the organization and a more direct tie with a popular campaign.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"gray_70\">PS.
