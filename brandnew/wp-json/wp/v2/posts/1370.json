A little over a year ago, the NEA came under the scrutiny of the design industry when it launched <a href=\"http:\/\/www.arts.gov\/artworks\/?p=767\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a $25,000-contest<\/a>, accompanied by a hefty 28-page RFP that asked for speculative work, to &#8220;represent the phrase &#8216;art works&#8217; in a single image.&#8221; The mantra of NEA Chairman, Rocco Landesman, &#8220;Art Works&#8221; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.arts.gov\/artworks\/?page_id=79\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">has three meanings<\/a>: &#8220;the works of art themselves, the ways art works on audiences, and art as work.&#8221; This month, the NEA has launched Art Works as what seems like a hybrid of awareness campaign and new logo. The Art Works identity has been created by Hoon Kim, principal of New York-based <a href=\"http:\/\/whynotsmile.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Why Not Smile<\/a> who was <a href=\"http:\/\/our.risd.edu\/2011\/02\/16\/hoon-kim-wins-nea-logo-design-competition\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">selected as the winner of the contest<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>The triple triangles are designed to represent the bold and memorable white ground letters A and W in all forms of communication. The process of recognizing the letters represents bridging the gap between Art Works and the audience.<br \/><br \/>The symbol is a metaphor for the three purposes of Art Works: 1. Works by Artist, 2. Art works on audiences, 3.

It&#8217;s just three triangles, yes, but they are <em>really<\/em> good triangles. There is a reason and concept behind, there is a strict graphic structure to it, and it&#8217;s simple and bold. I&#8217;m not a fan of the of primary-color approach and would love to see the extended color palette be used more. My favorite aspect of this is the black-and-white version that, instead of just doing a grayscale or all-black, uses texture to denote the three different triangles. Even better and demonstrating that there was a thinking graphic designer behind this, there is a version for small sizes that has more white space between all the circles, lines, and dots to avoid becoming a squished fly when reduced.<\/p>\n<p>Whether this sticks as the logo for the NEA in the long run remains to be seen, but for the time being, I&#8217;ll take these three rogue triangles over whatever the old logo was.  Certainly, I wouldn&#8217;t be a responsible blogger if I didn&#8217;t instigate a little: does the end justify the means?<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bonvia.us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mike Wachs<\/a> for the tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_110301_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_110301_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_110301_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_110301_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,63,26],"tags":[42,465],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1370"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1370"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1370\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1370"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1370"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1370"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
