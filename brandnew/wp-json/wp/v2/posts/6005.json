The identity and lifestyle and product imagery, designed by New York, NY-based <a href=\"http:\/\/noemielecoz.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Noemie Le Coz<\/a>, conveys a contagiously fun, carefree attitude that looks, for lack of a better way to describe it, happy. The color palette &#8212; not just in the logo and packaging but also in the lifestyle and product photos &#8212; is vibrant yet not jarring and feels like that feeling of a warm shower on a cold morning. The extra tall logo is playful and whimsical and I really like how it feels feminine but without having to be a frilly script font or drenched in pink.  <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/noemielecoz.com\/hello\/work\/billie\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Rabble by Touch<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_rabble.jpg\" alt=\"Rabble by Touch\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.rabbleedinburgh.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rabble<\/a> is a bar and restaurant PLUS a 10-room hotel in Edinburgh, Scotland. Self-described as &#8220;Rough-luxe&#8221; &#8212; that&#8217;s a first &#8212; the identity by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thetouchagency.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Touch<\/a> manages to, indeed, land on that rough-luxe combination with a funky, changing wordmark made up of extended and condensed unicase characters. There are also a set of secondary patterns that I&#8217;m not sure I quite get (or like) but they sure are different and provide some unexpected textures to the applications. I wouldn&#8217;t mind spending a few nights and meals there, that&#8217;s for sure. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.thetouchagency.co.uk\/project\/rabble\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Brandbags by Luminous Design Group<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_brandbags.jpg\" alt=\"Brandbags by Luminous Design Group\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.brandbags.gr\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brandbags<\/a> is a retailer of luxury leather accessories, importing brand name products to its two stores in Greece and its online shop. Their identity by Athens, Greece-based <a href=\"http:\/\/luminous.gr\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Luminous Design Group<\/a> features an elegant sans serif with contrasting thicknesses and although we&#8217;ve seen a few of these on Friday Likes, the applications are quite nice with a deep green color palette accented by gold and white. The oversize use of the logo in the bags is cool as well, supported by a slightly odd but kinda cool fragment of a square grid that also becomes a recurring element throughout the identity. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/luminous.gr\/projects\/brandbags-branding\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Some striking use of type and color in this week&apos;s projects with work from New York, Edinburgh, and Athens&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[51,11,85,86,26],"tags":[617,912,612,42,1505],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6005"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=6005"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6005\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=6005"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=6005"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=6005"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
