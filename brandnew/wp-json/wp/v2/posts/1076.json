For the most part, we cover big, national and global organizations or, at the very least, regional ones here on Brand New &mdash; the only way for a relatively unknown, small organization to get on here is, as stated in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/about-brand-new.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">our selection criteria<\/a>, to be &#8220;a <em>very<\/em> compelling design story.&#8221; Snakes make for <em>very<\/em> compelling design stories. Heading south from downtown Austin, Texas into the &uuml;ber-cool area of South Congress, the very first shop that you see is Luther&#8217;s. Barely a year old, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thelutherstore.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Luther&#8217;s<\/a> is an apparel and accessories shop for bad-ass (or wannabe bad-asses) men and women, carrying hardcore jeans, boots, shirts, fedoras and a range of products like hair pomade that are, literally, impossible to find anywhere else in Texas. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/sEdg4U8FFj2XzodGbqF9Yw?select=2eR9aa6Gz9yYoKZCHZaMgA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> And the decor<\/a>, set against exposed brick, is all Texas Rock &#8216;n&#8217; Roll. This past Friday, the fine folks at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.houseind.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">House Industries<\/a> passed through our little town to open an exhibit they set up at Luther&#8217;s and they took the opportunity to give the store a little more attitude with a revised logo.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/luthers_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"Luther's\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Structurally, the new logo is clearly based on the old one, with some subtle refinements. Stylistically, well, it is scales beyond cool over the old one. And sometimes, by golly, a little stylin&#8217; didn&#8217;t hurt anyone. As House Industries scarily notes, &#8220;there are over ten species and subspecies of rattlesnakes in Texas,&#8221; that in turn provide &#8220;a remarkably pliant and illustrative substrate for a script lettering treatment.&#8221; One of the main reasons I love this logo is said &#8220;pliance&#8221; and how it allows the logo to convey depth and volume without resorting to gradients, and works beautifully <a href=\"http:\/\/www.houseind.com\/showandtell\/2010\/03\/30\/HouseShowLectureinAustin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">in single color<\/a>. The logo manages to look menacing and cool at the same time, fitting the brand of Luther&#8217;s pretty tightly.<\/p>\n<p>House Industries&#8217; Ken Barber started off the lettering and Chris Gardner did the final rendering.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/luthers_sketches_01.jpg\" alt=\"Luther's\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/luthers_sketches_02.jpg\" alt=\"Luther's\" \/><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_100414_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_100414_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"574\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,86,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1076"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1076"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1076\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1076"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1076"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1076"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
