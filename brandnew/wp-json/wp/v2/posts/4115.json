Of all recent Olympics, this comes the closest. That is not to say it&#8217;s equally good but it&#8217;s surprisingly minimal and abstract. Without the introductory animation &mdash; that sets up the logo as living inside a circle, perhaps a direct (or perhaps unintentional) homage to Kamekura&#8217;s logo &mdash; the logo is confusing in that, yes, it&#8217;s &#8220;T&#8221; but also, unfortunately, there is an &#8220;L&#8221;. If it weren&#8217;t for the animation I would still be scratching my head about it but we&#8217;ll assume that the logo will appear animated enough times on people&#8217;s various screens to establish its structure, in which case the logo is quite good, at least in animated form. The potential for the Look of the Games with all the squares and circle corners is positively vast and engaging but a lot can happen in five years, so I&#8217;ll reserve my comments on that. (Still, the geometric patterns are kinda hot).<\/p>\n<p>The Clarendon-esque typography feels awfully American and it doesn&#8217;t pair well with the logo. While I do appreciate that the designer resisted (or avoided) the use of a Latin-Kanji-Hiragana-Katakana hybrid there is something off about the choice of type.<\/p>\n<blockquote>The Tokyo 2020 Paralympic emblem is inspired by = the universal sign of equality.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/tokyo2020.jp\/en\/news\/index.php?mode=page&#038;id=1410\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tokyo 2020 Organising Committee press release<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tokyo_2020_olympics_logo_detail_paralympics.png\" alt=\"New Logo for the 2020 Summer Olympic Games by Kenjiro Sano\" \/>\n<figcaption>Paralympics logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The best part of the animation (at the 1:36 mark) is the transformation from the Olympics logo to the Paralympics logo, with the range of shapes scrolling inside the logo to rearrange. Again, without the animation, the logo is hard to decipher, even after the press release states that it&#8217;s meant to evoke the equal sign which, you know, is typically horizontal.<\/p>\n<p class=\"end\">Overall, this is an unexpected aesthetic in its minimalism and color palette, and stands highly in contrast with the much more literal and colorful approach of Rio 2016 so, for now, I am optimistic that this could be a very memorable Olympic identity when developed with the thoughtful and delicate touch of Japanese design.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Not much by way of introduction: The 2020 Summer Olympics, aka the Games of the XXXII Olympiad, will take place in Tokyo, Japan.
