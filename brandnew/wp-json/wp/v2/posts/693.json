Maps was a contender, but in terms of a cool Web 1.0 name and functionality, MapQuest was it. This past August 26, MapQuest <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.mapquest.com\/2008\/08\/26\/the-mapquest-beta-part-ii-maps-and-forms-and-logos-oh-my\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">launched a Beta version of a redesign of the service<\/a>, including the de-bevelization of its logo &mdash; here is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mapquest_logo_comparison.php\" onclick=\"window.open('https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mapquest_logo_comparison.php','popup','width=329,height=221,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false\">a quick overlay and comparison of the logos<\/a>. This is as close as it gets to a miracle in twenty-first-century identity design. What&#8217;s great is that, underneath a decade of bevels was a pretty decent, fun logo with a hint of both Jetsons and Bowl-a-Rama, which is more than can be said for many logos. The new logo may not be the epitome of logo design, but it sure is perfect for its context and as an evolution of its web legacy. It&#8217;s too bad about all the rest of the AOL flotsam and jetsam that destroys the MapQuest page; no matter what improvements have been or not been made to the map&hellip; one minute spent there is one minute more than necessary.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Thanks to Mark Husson for the tip.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,26,90],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/693"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=693"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/693\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=693"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=693"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=693"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
