After eight years, this image appears to still hold value and has been redesigned by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.standapart.com.au\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Interbrand Australia<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>We knew that there were elements that were working in the old logo, the representation of a kangaroo, the sense of movement, energy and vitality, but its slightly childlike feel together with technical difficulties in reproduction often diluted its impact. What&#8217;s more, research had highlighted the fact that people saw Australia as a wonderfully colourful experience &mdash; blues and greens, as well as reds and oranges &mdash; but only some of these experiences were represented in the logo.<br \/><br \/>Extensive design exploration to reconsider and redraw the shape, poise and movement of the kangaroo &mdash; and its correlation with the sun &mdash; preceded further work on the use of colour and typography to complete the picture.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.standapart.com.au\/index.php\/tourism-australia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Interbrand project description<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tourism_australia_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"Tourism Australia Logo\" \/><\/p>\n<p>I remember the old logo coming out originally and it being part of the then-nascent trend of highly detailed and textural logos &mdash; Futurebrand, at the time, a leader in this trend (see UPS) &mdash; and thinking that it wasn&#8217;t all that bad. The rugged, outback-y look to the type and the sun were interesting and the sunset\/sunrise haze effect gave it a nice texture. But I can&#8217;t imagine having to reproduce that in print in a consistent manner. What a pain. The new logo keeps the same elements but gives them a fresh execution that doesn&#8217;t rely on gradients and lens flares to work. The new kangaroo is a very interesting solution. And a difficult one to pull off. The overlays work really well to help define the body parts of the kangaroo &mdash; tail, hip, torso, neck, head&hellip; they are all nicely delineated &mdash; and using the white gaps to denote elements in the back pane &mdash; left leg and ear, sun &mdash; help keep it clean and readable. The typography is perfectly decent and playing its supporting role. I love these kind of exercises, where it&#8217;s about finding a new way to visually solve the same premise.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to Matt Gibbs for first tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_121219_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_121219_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_121219_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_121219_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,64,26],"tags":[294,617,255,48],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2265"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2265"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2265\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2265"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2265"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2265"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
