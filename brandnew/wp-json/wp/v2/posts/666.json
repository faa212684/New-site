Last month <a href=\"http:\/\/news.lippincottmercer.com\/cgi-bin\/WebObjects\/LMNews.woa\/2\/wo\/DWdt44r9ttgt5laiHTDZBw\/0.11.7.1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Quick Chek unveiled a new identity<\/a>, and private-label developed product packaging developed by Lippincott  that help emphasize the store&#8217;s commitment to fresh food, including their brewed-every-twenty-minutes coffee. The old logo  felt like a bland and blunt New Jersey convenience store that looked more like a companion to a gas station, while the new logo and identity definitely improve the store&#8217;s appearance and its products, with a look more aligned with a sandwich or fresh produce shop. I really like the new icon, and how it has a little depth by using two colors to form the letter Q. The typography is forgettable, nothing to worry about but nothing to praise either, maybe a geometric sans would have added some interest. Overall, this is a great visual upgrade for a modest chain of stores that will likely benefit from the added differentiation that its design will provide it, specially against the innumerable amount of convenience stores peppered through the state.
