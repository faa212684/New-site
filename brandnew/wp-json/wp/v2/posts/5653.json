Originally a &#8220;paltry&#8221; four channels, Sky Sports has been adding channels slowly and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.skysports.com\/relaunch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">today it introduces a new system of nine channels<\/a> that more clearly defines what each offers (i.e., Sky Sports 4 is now Sky Sports Golf, so no surprises there). To coincide with this channel tune-up, Sky Sports has introduced a new identity designed by Sky Creative in partnership with London-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nomadstudio.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nomad<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>Sky Creative are the multi-disciplinary creative agency behind the new Sky Sports rebrand. As part of their progressive and collaborative approach, they invited Nomad to partner with them on a seven month journey to reimagine Sky Sports from the ground up.<br \/><br \/>The brief, based on strategic marketing insight, was to create a new Sky Sports, one that offers complete control to its customers by creating nine dedicated sports channels. The result is a fresh and modern brand that positions Sky Sports as the ultimate sports storyteller; moving beyond the cliche celebratory moments to bring you every side of the story &#8211; the grit, the pain, the passion and the disappointments.<\/blockquote><h3>Nomad provided text<\/h3>\n<!--<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/225865467?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Redesign presentation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>-->\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sky_sports_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Sky Sports by Sky Creative and Nomad\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sky_sport_logo_social_before_after.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Sky Sports by Sky Creative and Nomad\" \/>\n<figcaption>Social media version, before and after.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sky_sports_logo_subbrands.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Sky Sports by Sky Creative and Nomad\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sub-brands (or &#8220;Genres&#8221; in Sky Sports parlance).<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo you kind of just took for granted that that&#8217;s what it was supposed to look like because it aligns with the Sky brand and, well, <a href=\"http:\/\/logos.wikia.com\/wiki\/Sky_Sports\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">it&#8217;s been like that for 15 years<\/a>, give or take a shine effect or ten. The new logo &#8212; designed in collaboration with <a href=\"https:\/\/newlyn.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Miles Newlyn<\/a> &#8212; retains the same structure with the biggest change being switching from uppercase to lowercase. Both are equally valid solutions and both have their pros and cons &#8212; I liked how the old uppercase had equal margins all around, for example &#8212; but the new one capitalizes (pun!) on the strength of the Sky wordmark by continuing its lowercase design and creating a bouncier rhythm with the single ascender and single descender of &#8220;sky&#8221; and &#8220;sports&#8221;. The design of the new &#8220;sports&#8221; wordmark is pretty nice and balanced; I really like how they were able to make &#8220;sports&#8221; feel like a sub-brand of &#8220;sky&#8221; by matching the shape of the &#8220;s&#8221;s but with &#8220;sky&#8221; clearly having the cooler, higher-in-the-totem-pole &#8220;s&#8221;. The minimized gradient\/shading\/highlighting of the logo is also welcome but I find it funny that they couldn&#8217;t get rid of it altogether.<\/p>\n<p>The sub-brands of Sky &#8212; or &#8220;Genres&#8221; as they are being called &#8212; replace <a href=\"http:\/\/underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sky_sports_old.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the more heavy-handed channel breakdown of before<\/a> and work seamlessly with the logo.
