It&#8217;s a technique that lifts the regal nature of the client it represents and implies a certain sophistication even if it&#8217;s a pair of crossed plungers.&#8221; Other interesting trends are &#8220;Eyelet&#8221;, &#8220;Written&#8221; and &#8220;Line Craft&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to  <a href=\"http:\/\/emblemetric.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">James I.

University of New Hampshire Presentation<\/h1>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/may2013_inbrief_unh.jpg\" alt=\"April Miscellany\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The University of New Hampshire has been working with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cgstudionyc.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Chermayeff &amp; Geismar &amp; Haviv<\/a> to redesign their identity and, in a strange case of public sharing, they have released (sort of) a taping of Tom Geismar and Sagi Haviv presenting three identity contenders. The video can be watched <a href=\"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/65761467\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">on vimeo<\/a> using &#8220;unhwildcats2013&#8221; as the password. For further reading, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.unionleader.com\/article\/20130521\/NEWS04\/130529873\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this story<\/a> has all the sordid details, including C&amp;G&amp;H&#8217;s $100,000-fee. I wonder if the presentation was taped so that when the eventual shit hits the fan and students complain about the logo change and due process they can show them this.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"red\">Update 8:55 am:<\/span> Ah, too bad, they have removed the video altogether. I wish they would have kept it, it was an interesting look at the process. Sorry to all the late risers who missed it.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to Jonathan Steinberg for the tip.<\/p>\n<h1>3.
