The identity, designed by Vancouver, BC-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pendo.ca\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pendo<\/a>, features a great stacked wordmark in a slab serif, which, side note, I think has been the most underused type style of the decade. But I digress. I love how neatly the two words line up with the &#8220;ER&#8221;s satisfyingly matching at the end and without it being a monospace font. The orange-red-brown-brick-like color is great and I really like how it&#8217;s a single-color identity, yet there is so much texture to it. The animal illustrations are a nice addition and, used sparingly, provide subtle contrasts in different applications. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.pendo.ca\/hunter-gather\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Taller Multidisciplinar by Bala<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_tallermulti_a.jpg\" alt=\"Taller Multidisciplinar by Bala\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/tallermulti.mx\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Taller Multidisciplinar<\/a> is an architecture firm in Veracruz, Mexico, specializing in public spaces. The identity, designed by Mexico City-based <a href=\"https:\/\/bala.mx\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bala<\/a>, introduces a changing, double-M monogram that alludes both to the idea of a multidisciplinary studio and that the two founders&#8217; names start with &#8220;M&#8221; (Mauro and Miriam). This doesn&#8217;t have the glitz and glam of most Friday Likes but I really like how different it is, in a kind of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=Designers+Republic&#038;lr=&#038;safe=active&#038;tbs=lr:lang_1en-US&#038;source=lnms&#038;tbm=isch&#038;sa=X&#038;ved=2ahUKEwiYrfSLqL_nAhWVBc0KHTQbAnYQ_AUoAXoECBIQAw&#038;biw=1381&#038;bih=882\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Designers Republic<\/a>-lite aesthetic but also just kind of marching to the beat of its own drum. The dots and bars and pieces of &#8220;M&#8221;s scattered in clusters on each application are pretty cool and the green and black combo with so much white around it looks striking. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/91511729\/Taller-Multidisciplinar\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Chit Par Jewelry by Poke.<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_chitpar_a.jpg\" alt=\"Chit Par Jewelry by Poke.\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.chitparjewelry.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Chit Par Jewelry<\/a> is a jewelry brand in Myanmar creating rings, necklaces, earrings, and brooches using gemstones. The identity, designed by Yangon, Myanmar-based <a href=\"https:\/\/poke.studio\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Poke.<\/a>, has a lovely combination of elements that include a delicate and elegant small-serifs serif wordmark, a high-contrast sans, and a gem-like monogram (that I imagine has letters in Burmese). The identity doesn&#8217;t break any conventions but all the elements work great together in the different configurations, from boxes to ribbons, and the rusty orange color is quite nice. Major props for a killer invoice sheet. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/90100689\/Chit-Par-Jewelry\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"A wide range of styles this week with work from Vancouver, Mexico City, and Yangon&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[58,51,11,85,26],"tags":[261,1788,570],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8431"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=8431"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8431\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=8431"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=8431"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=8431"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
