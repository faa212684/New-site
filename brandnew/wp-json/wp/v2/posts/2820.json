MTV Media is one of Finland&#8217;s main media broadcasters with three leading free-to-air television channels &mdash; MTV3, Sub, AVA &mdash; nine pay-TV channels under the &#8220;MTV3 Total packet&#8221; moniker and also manages Radio Nova, a popular commercial radio station. Yesterday, a complete new look for all the channels was introduced on air. Below is a breakdown of some of the new looks and on-air packages designed by DixonBaxi. I won&#8217;t be commenting in detail on all of them, just a few observations on each and a summary at the end.<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/MBBCrY3YL5Q\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Teaser-slash-historical account of MTV Media.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>All images below sourced from <a href=\"http:\/\/brandingsource.blogspot.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Branding Source<\/a>.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mtv_fi_followup_brand_architecture.png\" alt=\"Follow-up: MTV Media\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brand architecture.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mtv_fi_followup_all_logos.png\" alt=\"Follow-up: MTV Media\" \/>\n<figcaption>All logos, before and after.

None of the logos stand out as particularly good or bad, they just&hellip; are.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">MTV Media<\/h1>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mtv_fi_followup_mtv_stationery.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: MTV Media\" \/>\n<figcaption>MTV Media stationery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mtv_fi_followup_mtv_variations.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: MTV Media\" \/>\n<figcaption>MTV Media logo variations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The MTV Media logo did not receive a warm welcome when we first posted it and the new applications don&#8217;t do much to engender increased attraction. The approach of turning the logo into all these mysterious textures and objects and textures feels forced and out of place for a non-sci-fi channel. It&#8217;s a valiant attempt to turn a non-active logo into something more but I would have just left it alone. The stationery image introduces a light sans serif and then a serif which don&#8217;t come quite together. It feels like a corporate image trying to be cool.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">MTV3<\/h1>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mtv_fi_followup_mtv3_logo_history.png\" alt=\"Follow-up: MTV Media\" \/>\n<figcaption>MTV3 owl logo history.

A couple more <a href=\"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/user11750688\/videos\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a>.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>This is perhaps the biggest consumer-facing change as MTV3 is one of the most popular channels in Finland and it has been using an owl as its logo for decades, finally dropping it in favor of a &#8220;3&#8221; oddly attached to the corporate logo. In animation, the logo emanates some sort of weird spiral thing. The footage is great and there are some great visual moments but when the logo comes in, it just feels kind of cheap and out of place.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">MTV News<\/h1>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mtv_fi_followup_mtvnews.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: MTV Media\" \/>\n<\/figure>\n<p>It&#8217;s alright.

This is the female-targeted channel.

The combination of graphics and sound are excellent and it definitely establishes a groovy, weird vibe. Perhaps it gets a bit too close for the Syfy idents.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p class=\"end\">Overall, everything seems like it could have used a couple more months of attention as if, in an effort to launch everything at once, each channel didn&#8217;t get as fully developed as it could. Overarching identity programs like this are really hard to pull off and, although there are enough interesting moments to hold this together, I think this would have benefited from a staggered approach and launching each channel on its own timeline.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Back in September we noted the new logo for MTV Media designed by London-based DixonBaxi.
