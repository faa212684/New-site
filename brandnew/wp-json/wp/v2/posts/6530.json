Owned by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.metcash.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Metcash<\/a>, an Australian grocery distributor, IGA has over 1,400 locations across Australia and is part of American-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.iga.com\/consumer\/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Independent Grocers Association<\/a> (with the same IGA acronym and same logo) that has over 5,000 stores in over 30 countries. Recently, IGA (the Australia one) introduced a new identity designed by the Sydney office of <a href=\"http:\/\/interbrand.com\/au\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Interbrand<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>While customers can walk into any Woolies in Australia and expect it to be just like all the others, every IGA has the freedom to choose its own products, prices and ways of doing things.<br \/><br \/>Put simply, no two IGA&#8217;s are the same. And in an industry that&#8217;s focusing more on convenience, price and <em>consistency<\/em> than ever, that disparity poses a problem.<br \/><br \/>The temptation was to scrap it all; the local promos, one-off oyster bars, and seemingly infinite variations of the IGA logo. But there was something undeniably charming in it. The locals loved the promos. Brett&#8217;s customers loved their oysters. And despite a combined century&#8217;s worth of branding experience, we started to love all those logos. IGA didn&#8217;t need less of what made it different. It needed <em>more<\/em>.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/interbrand.com\/au\/work\/putting-heart-soul-back-grocery-shopping\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Interbrand project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/iga_old_logos_all.jpg\" alt=\"New Logos and Identity for IGA by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>A sampling of old logos.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>Based on signwriting &#8211; the warm, personal, hand-crafted art form that&#8217;s been part of local store DNA from the very beginning &#8211; the identity represents IGA&#8217;s mission to bring the heart and soul back into grocery shopping. The typeface is supported by an illustration toolkit. Adaptable and accessible, it empowers every store owner to create their own designs, messages and yes, even logos, without making the IGA brand suffer.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/interbrand.com\/au\/work\/putting-heart-soul-back-grocery-shopping\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Interbrand project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/iga_logos_all.jpg\" alt=\"New Logos and Identity for IGA by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>A sampling of new logos.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/iga_logos_old_animated.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Some new logos animated.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>It does not take a logo connoisseur to realize the dire situation that the old logos found themselves in, each more impossibly garish than the next. What they lacked in sophistication, though, they made up in charm; I mean&#8230; that &#8220;Woorim Beach&#8221; one? Get me a heather gray t-shirt in L with it on it, please. But I digress. The new logos do a great job in maintaining the charm of individual and expressive logos while establishing both a highly flexible and graphically consistent system that gives the each store a continued sense of independence and of ownership in how their store presents itself. It will be interesting to see what happens when the other 1,370 stores make their own logos (vs. the 30 shown in this post that) but there definitely seems to be a playful system in place that will keep things neat and attractive. I especially like that the &#8220;clear space&#8221; around the IGA logo is none and that you can draw leafs, mountains, and tractors around, under, and above it.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/222623974?title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Brand video.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>Of course, logos can&#8217;t stock the shelves for you &#8211; no matter how many you have. The most rewarding part of the project was working with the store owners themselves, helping them find new and meaningful ways to improve the experience for their customers. Thankfully inspiration wasn&#8217;t hard to find &#8211; IGA&#8217;s best and brightest offered enough tips to fill a book. So&#8230; we did. Now, every IGA has the platform &#8211; and the playbook &#8211; to be the best store in town.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/interbrand.com\/au\/work\/putting-heart-soul-back-grocery-shopping\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Interbrand project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/iga_handbook.jpg\" alt=\"New Logos and Identity for IGA by Interbrand\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/iga_magazine.jpg\" alt=\"New Logos and Identity for IGA by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Handbook.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/iga_style_guide_a.jpg\" alt=\"New Logos and Identity for IGA by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Style guide.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/iga_signwriting_styles.gif\" alt=\"New Logos and Identity for IGA by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sign painting styles<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The visual (and philosophical to a degree) toolkit that relies on sign painting and its inherent warmth and individuality set a great tone for IGA and it does it in a way that is fairly simple and straightforward so that any store can apply it successfully.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/iga_independence.jpg\" alt=\"New Logos and Identity for IGA by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Celebrating Independents badge.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/iga_posters.jpg\" alt=\"New Logos and Identity for IGA by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Posters.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/iga_interior_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logos and Identity for IGA by Interbrand\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/iga_interior_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logos and Identity for IGA by Interbrand\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/iga_interior_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logos and Identity for IGA by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Store renders.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/iga_newspaper.jpg\" alt=\"New Logos and Identity for IGA by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Newspaper.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/iga_coffee_cup.jpg\" alt=\"New Logos and Identity for IGA by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Coffee cups.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/iga_tshirt.jpg\" alt=\"New Logos and Identity for IGA by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>T-shirts.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/iga_totebag.jpg\" alt=\"New Logos and Identity for IGA by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Tote.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">We&#8217;ve seen the combination of scripts and a condensed sans serif a hundred times over so that may not seem as original but as a system to deploy independently it will provide ease of use and yield consistent results that will look great for as many stores as possible as they keep fighting the good fight of staying independent as conglomerates get more conglomerate-y every day.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1988, Independent Grocers of Australia (IGA) is a chain of supermarkets in Australia that in contrast to regular supermarket chains &#8212;
