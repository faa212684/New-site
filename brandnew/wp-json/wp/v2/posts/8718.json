(Small quibble: the &#8220;O&#8221; is not quite right as it has a super thin contrast that is not present in any of the other letters.) The composition of the design on the container looks so great, with the logo taking up a lot space, printed only in white, with the illustrations in the bottom in full color, with everything offset by the deep, rich colors of the jams and chutneys. I want to make that blackberry one <em>my<\/em> jam. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.unifiedbrands.co.nz\/work\/anathoth\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Tamarind by Dutchscot<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_tamarind.jpg\" alt=\"Tamarind by Dutchscot\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.tamarindrestaurant.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tamarind<\/a>, in the Mayfair district of London, UK, is one of the first Indian restaurants in the world to win a Michelin star.

Designed by London-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dutch.scot\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dutchscot<\/a>, the highlight of the project, for me at least, are the beautiful abstract interpretations of flowers made from dry powder, alluding to Holi, the popular ancient Hindu festival where people cover themselves in color. Printed on translucent paper on the menus, the flowers become even more unique and elegant and I love the interplay with the cover, where a thin curved stroke in gold foil stamp is the stem. Everything here, from materials to color palette to production method, exudes sophistication. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/95408455\/Tamarind\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Lively Beerworks by Switch<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_livelybeerworks.jpg\" alt=\"Lively Beerworks by Switch\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.livelybeerworks.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lively Beerworks<\/a> is a micro brewery in Oklahoma City, OK. The identity, designed by local firm <a href=\"https:\/\/switch.is\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Switch<\/a>, revolves around a lovely (and lively) icon that is generously displayed on the can, taking up a good three quarters of the real estate, which is a nice change of pace from cans where primary logos take a back seat to more complex illustrations or layouts. The minimalist icon is supported by a minimalist type approach, with everything typeset in a single weight of <a href=\"https:\/\/commercialtype.com\/catalog\/platform\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Platform<\/a>, which was overused for a while and I hadn&#8217;t seen it used in some time. It works great in this project, in particular with the, um, <em>lively<\/em> color palette that makes everything feel happy, like good beer should. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/switch.is\/project\/livelybeerworks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"A serving of two thirds stencil and one third sans serif this week, with work from Auckland, London, and Oklahoma City&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[51,11,85,26],"tags":[184,1122,337,424,838,564],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8718"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=8718"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8718\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=8718"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=8718"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=8718"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
