They have brought cricket &mdash; by training teachers, providing equipment, linking schools to local cricket clubs &mdash; to 2.5 million children in 11,000 state schools across England and Wales. Recently, Chance to Shine introduced a new identity designed by London-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wearearticle.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Article<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>[The logo] is based on the combination of a batsman&#8217;s wagon wheel graphic and a spark. The spark comes from the &#8216;shine&#8217; part of the charity&#8217;s name and represents the positive benefits it ignites in young people like teamwork, passion, discipline and respect. The reach and impact of our programmes is encapsulated in a new strapline: &#8216;spreading the power of cricket&#8217;.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.chancetoshine.org\/news\/new-year-sparks-change-at-chance-to-shine\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Chance to Shine press release<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/chance_to_shine_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Chance to Shine by Article\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>Based on the combination of a batsman&#8217;s wagon wheel and a spark, the simple yellow lines of the &#8216;Spark&#8217; logo are used dynamically throughout the identity in print, digital and moving image, visually representing Chance to Shine&#8217;s ambition to spread the power of cricket far and wide.<\/blockquote><h3>Article provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/chance_to_shine_spark_explanation.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Chance to Shine by Article\" \/>\n<figcaption>Spark explanation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>It&#8217;s amazing that Chance to Shine got a single kid to pick up a bat with that near-parody of a logo they had: a stitched apple (like a cricket ball) with a poor man&#8217;s Comic Sans wordmark and a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.myfonts.com\/fonts\/adobe\/lithos\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lithos<\/a> tagline. More power to them. The new logo takes the visual of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=cricket+wagon+wheel&#038;lr=lang_en&#038;biw=1521&#038;bih=910&#038;tbs=lr:lang_1en&#038;source=lnms&#038;tbm=isch&#038;sa=X&#038;ei=wMrlVKynEoejgwTgz4PwBA&#038;ved=0CAYQ_AUoAQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">wagon wheel<\/a> &mdash; &#8220;A graphical chart which divides a cricket ground into six sectors and shows how many runs a batsman has scored into each area&#8221; (as described by <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Glossary_of_cricket_terms#W\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wikipedia<\/a>) &mdash; and turns it into a spark. As an idea, it&#8217;s a nice blend of the charity&#8217;s main focus and its name; and, as an icon, it&#8217;s a simple, energetic identifier. It works best against black, looking like an exploding firework. The typography is fairly forgettable and not quite well related to the icon; it&#8217;s neither bolder enough to be clearly distinct nor is it light enough to match the thickness of the spark. The uppercase approach makes it too serious as well.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/chance_to_shine_business_cards.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Chance to Shine by Article\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/chance_to_shine_brochure.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Chance to Shine by Article\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brochure.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/chance_to_shine_lingo.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Chance to Shine by Article\" \/>\n<figcaption>Lingo cheat sheet.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Ou1G_cfsRgo\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Introduction to Chance to Shine.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">In application, there is a lot of yellow and black, a lot of different diagonals that play off the icon and the introduction of a stencil font (that doesn&#8217;t feel like a natural fit). It&#8217;s all pretty decent if a little hodgepodge at times. Nonetheless, I am sure it&#8217;s a vast improvement over whatever materials they previously had and the new identity establishes a more clear and engaging visual link between the organization and cricket.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 2005, Chance to Shine is a UK charity dedicated to reversing the decline in cricket &mdash; the sport not the insect &mdash; in state schools.
