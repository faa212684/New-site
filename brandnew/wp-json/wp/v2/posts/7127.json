If you are a long-time reader you may have noticed a decline in advertising from outside sources &#8212; we used to have a queue of 5 advertisers a month for 2 &#8211; 3 years running &#8212; and what&#8217;s baffling is that this past year is the strongest our monthly readership has been, averaging 1.8 million pageviews a month. <strong>So&#8230;<\/strong> We are running a modest, <a href=\"https:\/\/goo.gl\/forms\/m6WtdDSqnKKk8vjj2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">5-minute survey<\/a> to help us better define our audience to help convince advertisers that you all are alright and they should spend some of their marketing budget on Brand New.
