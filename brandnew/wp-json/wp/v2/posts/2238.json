Knopf&#8217;s dog or Penguin&#8217;s penguin. The icon and the typography meshed well with their angled edges and rough finish. So why change, right? Well, apparently, HMH has gone through some management, debt, and &#8220;balance sheet&#8221; issues since 2009 and things finally seem to be in order so it&#8217;s, pardon the pun, a textbook case to signal change through a new identity and positioning.<\/p>\n<p>Based on the brand&#8217;s essence, &#8220;Inspire curiosity&#8221;, the new logo is a great play on it, showing a triangle that, unless you were curious, you would never think of picking up and rotating it to reveal that it&#8217;s not just a triangle but a cone and that by changing its position and point of view it turns into a completely different primary shape. It&#8217;s perhaps a very literal logo and at first glance it&#8217;s kind of weird to see the three shapes there but the payoff of trying to understand it is rewarding. It&#8217;s no arrow-in-the-FedEx-logo kind of reveal, but it requires more power of deduction than a boy riding on a dolphin. I really like the icon, especially when you consider a couple of their main audiences are children and educators &mdash; the primary shapes are a perfect metaphor. The typography is as exciting as the clothing choices of your average history teacher and perhaps skew too much to the corporate side of things, making the logo look more like that of a law firm than a publisher. In application, not much happens. Just the logo in an appropriate corner and a nice use of yellow and dark gray; nothing exciting but nothing offensive either. Overall, I think it&#8217;s a bold change that risks alienating anyone with an attachment to the old logo but who might also be clinging on to a book industry of yore and not acknowledging the demands put on a large business in the twenty-first century.<\/p>\n<script language=\"JavaScript\" type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"http:\/\/admin.brightcove.com\/js\/BrightcoveExperiences.js\"><\/script>\n<p><object id=\"myExperience1990692303001\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\">\n  <param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\" \/>\n  <param name=\"width\" value=\"574\" \/>\n  <param name=\"height\" value=\"323\" \/>\n  <param name=\"playerID\" value=\"1524389847001\" \/>\n  <param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAABYdtE7Vk~,ZKcTnzR2FiWqJqG3OB04UTRos9xgZ3xs\" \/>\n  <param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\" \/>\n  <param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\" \/>\n  <param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\" \/>\n  <param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"1990692303001\" \/>\n<\/object><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Very in-depth explanation about the rebranding.
