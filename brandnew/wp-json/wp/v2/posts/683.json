Nonetheless the wordmark created by BGBA is an assertive design that is streamlined and confident. I am regularly skeptical towards unicase wordmarks, but this one works better than most, specially since all characters occupy neatly the same visual width (the M is a little wider) and the lowercase &#8220;e&#8221;s add a nice rhythm that the monotonous uppercase &#8220;E&#8221; wouldn&#8217;t, so instead of arriving at a wordmark with nine horizontal bars this is a good balance of round corners and straight lines. The accent over the last &#8220;e&#8221; does a great task in making the wordmark more asymmetrical and creating a beginning and an end point.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/emege_boxes.jpg\" alt=\"Emeg&eacute; Packaging\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/emege_manual.png\" alt=\"Emeg&eacute; Manual\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Packaging and collateral samples.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/emege_museo.gif\" alt=\"Emeg&eacute; Museum Logo\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Logo for a museum within corporate headquarters.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/emege_slogan.gif\" alt=\"Emeg&eacute; Slogan\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Tag line.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>To support the simple and contemporary wordmark, BGBA selected <a href=\"http:\/\/www.processtypefoundry.com\/typefaces\/klavika\/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Process Type Foundry&#8217;s Klavika<\/a> for use in the identity. One of my favorite things about this project is the tag line and its adorning accent: &#8220;Cada d&iacute;a m&aacute;s&#8221; which literally translates to &#8220;Each day more&#8221; is visualized by the uphill slant of the accent, which in Spanish serves as a way to denote that emphasis should be placed on the letter directly below it, so together it works as a nice metaphor for continued and increased positive movement.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,51,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/683"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=683"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/683\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=683"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=683"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=683"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
