Typically typographic-driven, these identities are low-key and rarely too distinct; understated and elegant is the name of the game; and &#8220;a workhorse&#8221; is the most sought-after quality, as the identity must accommodate dozens of programs, schools, divisions and more in hundreds of applications. Coming up with unique and proprietary characteristics for a university wordmark is usually the challenge. In its elongated <em>R<\/em> and funny-serifed <em>U<\/em>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rutgers.edu\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey<\/a>, has found an identity that saves it from 20 years of different and inconsistent identities.<\/p><!--more--><p>Designed by Chicago-based Lipman Hearne &mdash; one of the most prolific design firms of university materials &mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/identity.rutgers.edu\/marks.shtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the new identity<\/a> is one more step in establishing a better message and improve communications for Rutgers in order to attract (and retain) the best possible alumni and faculty &mdash; a concern all too relevant for all universities. While the Rutgers identity is nothing extraordinary &mdash; and perhaps even too eclectic in the slightly unconventional serif type choice (as it&#8217;s not classical enough, but not modern enough either, making no statement at all) &mdash; it is distinct and personal to the university, emphasizing the peculiar name. (Peculiar, at least to my ears). <\/p>\n<p>Rutgers contracted <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lipmanhearne.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lipman Hearne<\/a> to the tune of <a href=\"http:\/\/ur.rutgers.edu\/focus\/article\/Rutgers%20hires%20nationally%20recognized%20marketing%20and%20communications%20firm\/1641\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a one-year contract reportedly worth US$500,000<\/a> to help develop the message, the identity and the implementation. A figure that sounds high, but considering the amount of work that goes into developing an identity for a university &mdash; numerous meetings with boards and committees alone justifies the price, I think &mdash; it seems par for the course. It is also inevitable not to raise eyebrows and scorn from those within the community: In <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dailytargum.com\/user\/index.cfm?event=displayregistrationprompt&#038;requiredregistration=1&#038;thereferer=http%3A\/\/media.www.dailytargum.com\/media\/storage\/paper168\/news\/2005\/09\/22\/Opinions\/Revamping.The.r-994032.shtml%3Fsourcedomain%3Dwww.dailytargum.com%26MIIHost%3Dmedia.collegepublisher.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">an article<\/a> subtitled &#8220;Spending thousands to improve image that won&#8217;t change&#8221;, the <em>Daily Targum<\/em> questions the decision to spend so much money on an outside firm by writing, &#8220;If administrators really feel the need to revamp the school&#8217;s image, they should do it in house and not waste millions of the school&#8217;s dollars on it. Mason Gross School of the Arts has an excellent graphic design program, and the business school has plenty of professors who study advertising.&#8221; When I first read the <a href=\"http:\/\/ur.rutgers.edu\/medrel\/viewArticle.html?ArticleID=5498\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">press release<\/a> for the identity I silently giggled at one line, &#8220;A visual identity system is a set of <strong>professionally designed<\/strong> graphic marks that are approved for use when an institution&#8217;s name is displayed in various media and formats.&#8221; [Emphasis mine]. It seemed a funny distinction to make in a press release, but a poignant one nonetheless: University identities might seem simplistic but, in reality, they are no child&#8217;s play.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_hor_single.gif\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The identity includes a simplified (or &#8220;informal&#8221;) seal and the retention of the block <em>R<\/em> as a &#8220;spirit mark&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/rutgers_seals.gif\" alt=\"Rutgers Seal, Official and Simple Versions\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_hor_single.gif\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/rutgers_spirit_mark.gif\" alt=\"Rutgers Spirit Mark\" \/><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,29,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/465"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=465"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/465\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=465"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=465"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=465"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
