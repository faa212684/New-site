The logo, by Brighton, UK-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.baxterandbailey.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Baxter and Bailey<\/a> is one of those rare logos that brings a big smile to your face when the name of the business and its graphic representation are so in sync and it hurts from jealousy. Point being, Bog Eyed Books has a bog-eyed-book for a logo and it&#8217;s superb. Even without the animation, the logo tells its story in a single panel. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.baxterandbailey.co.uk\/work\/bog-eyed-books\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Chuck&#8217;s Steakhouse by Glasfurd &amp; Walker<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_chuckssteakhouse.jpg\" alt=\"Chuck's Steakhouse by Glasfurd &amp; Walker\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.chuckssteakhouse.ca\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Chuck&#8217;s Steakhouse<\/a>, as its name implies, is a steakhouse in Banff, Alberta, specializing in all kinds of meats and sporting a beautiful three-letter monogram designed by Vancouver, Canada-based <a href=\"http:\/\/glasfurdandwalker.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Glasfurd &amp; Walker<\/a>. The nested letters and how the &#8220;S&#8221; and &#8220;H&#8221; share a line is as juicy as a good piece of steak. The identity also manages to pull off an extremely rare feat of having a high-end, cowboy chic look. The extended slab serif for the wordmark could easily look cartoonish if executed differently but here, along with the color palette, production methods, and even accompanying engraving illustrations it all looks elegant but also rugged. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/glasfurdandwalker.com\/project\/chucks-steakhouse\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Mama Mafia by Openmint<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_mamamafia_a.jpg\" alt=\"Mama Mafia by Openmint\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/foursquare.com\/v\/mama-mafia\/5232f96e11d262fda914d6b8?tipsSort=popular\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mama Mafia<\/a> is a delivery restaurant in St. Petersburg, Russia, that serves up a double threat of Italian <em>and<\/em> Japanese food that, in the words of Moscow-based <a href=\"http:\/\/openmintdesign.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Openmint<\/a>, who designed the identity, &#8220;is a mix of the home-taste food like &#8216;from mama&#8217;, the delivery speed, which is faster than a bullet from the Tommy gun, and a strict quality control, worthy of Yakuza.&#8221; The two odd kitchen-fellows come alive in funky, bouncy, energetic illustrations featuring all kinds of henchmen and henchfood that add up to a fun pattern used throughout the materials. The brown and orange color palette gives everything a homey feel for an ultimately weird but satisfying combination of concepts and styles. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/27666911\/Mama-Mafia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Lots of fun-looking projects this week, with work from Brighton, Vancouver, and Moscow&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,82,85,26],"tags":[40,762,564],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5555"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=5555"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5555\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=5555"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=5555"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=5555"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
