Extraordinary service. We wanted to create a car company different from the rest, one that provided a great service to our customers. Soon we were changing the way car service companies worked. Now we serve 10 million passengers in our home town of London every year and have expanded out to 350 cities worldwide. Our drivers get training not just in the practicalities of the road, but in how to deliver the most helpful, polished service. Our knowledge of transport logistics allows us to run a cutting-edge courier company too. We like to approach each journey as a new opportunity to serve our customers even better.&#8221;<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/addison_lee_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo for Addison Lee by Whistlejacket\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/addison_lee_car_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Addison Lee by Whistlejacket\" \/>\n<figcaption>Livery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/addison_lee_car_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Addison Lee by Whistlejacket\" \/>\n<figcaption>Livery detail.
