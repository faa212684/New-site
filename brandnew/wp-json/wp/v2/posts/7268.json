This is a rare Friday Like where what you see is what you get&#8230; it&#8217;s just a logo and it&#8217;s just a business card but I found both things to be totally endearing. Designed by New York, NY-based <a href=\"https:\/\/verenamichelitsch.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Verena Michelitsch<\/a>, the logo is a modest jumble of playful organic letters that follow not a single trend at the moment and are just effusive for the sake of visual joy. The single application of the business cards multiplies the logo&#8217;s effect in a collection of colorful papers with a great tactile combination of embossing and foil stamping in fun colors. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/verenamichelitsch.com\/project\/jumbo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">CO.CO by Pop &amp; Pac<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_cocoxo.jpg\" alt=\"CO.CO by Pop &amp; Pac\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cocoxo.com.au\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CO.CO<\/a> is a homewares and gifts retailer in Melbourne, Australia, offering a carefully curated collection of items through one retail store and online. The identity, designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pop-pac.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pop &amp; Pac<\/a>, aptly captures the aesthetic of the products as a mix of playfulness, sophistication, and a certain softness. The CO.CO logo is as simple as it gets but it&#8217;s done perfectly right and the accompanying graphic confetti looks great &#8212; no idea what it is or stands for but I sure enjoy looking at the different abstract compositions of it in the bag, business cards, and cups. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/74993831\/CoCo-Xo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">M\u00fa by Savvy Agency<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_mu_gelato.jpg\" alt=\"M\u00fa by Savvy Agency\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/gelatomu.wordpress.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">M\u00fa<\/a> is a provider of Italian gelato in Lisbon, Portugal, with one location and a selection of roaming\/catering options. The identity, designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/savvy.pt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Savvy Agency<\/a>, revolves around flat blobby gelato shapes in soft pastel colors against a white backdrop all nicely accented by the simple high-contrast sans serif logo that, even though it only has two letters, has been perfectly spaced. I love the simplicity of the design and how it&#8217;s really just the gelato-textured shapes in different configurations regardless of shape &#8212; cone, cup, label &#8212; with the elegant logo on top. The gelato itself looks amazing too. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/savvy.pt\/posts\/mu-gelato-italiano\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"A range of soft and relatively subdued projects this week, with work from New York, Melbourne, and Lisbon&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,85,86,26],"tags":[915,781,498,130],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7268"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=7268"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7268\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=7268"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=7268"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=7268"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
