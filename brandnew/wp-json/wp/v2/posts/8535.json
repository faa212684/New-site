We believe in better buildings; places that complement our environment and enhance our communities. Places that give people better, brighter, healthier spaces to live, work and play. Green building is a win-win, offering both environmental and economic opportunity. Greater building efficiency can meet 85 percent of future demand for energy in the United States and a commitment to green building has the potential to generate 2.5 million jobs. USGBC is made up of tens of thousands of member organizations, chapters and student and community volunteers that are moving the building industry forward in a way that has never been seen before. We are a diverse group of builders and environmentalists, corporations and nonprofits, teachers and students, lawmakers and citizens. Today we are 77 chapters, 13,000 member organizations and 188,000 LEED professionals strong that share the same vision of a sustainable built environment for all within the next generation.&#8221;<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/usgbc_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for U.S. Green Building Council\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/usgbc_icon_colors.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for U.S. Green Building Council\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icon color variations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/usgbc_wordmark.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for U.S. Green Building Council\" \/>\n<figcaption>Wordmark.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/usgbc_iconography.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for U.S. Green Building Council\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icon set and illustrations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ugsbc_materials.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for U.S. Green Building Council\" \/>\n<figcaption>Various applications.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/egVr_xuSrYs\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Identity presentation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"(Est. 2013) &quot;The U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) and its community are changing the way buildings and communities are designed, built and operated.
