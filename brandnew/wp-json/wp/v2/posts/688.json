That red and green traffic light, while paired with some heavy-handed typography and an even heavier containing shape, had an amazing amount of brand recognition for two colored dots. I&#8217;m convinced that in my original neck of the woods, you could stick that traffic light symbol up in front of anyone at all and they could recognize the company without fail. <\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/stopshop_giant_logo.gif\" alt=\"Giant Logo, Before and After\" \/><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not as familiar with the Giant logo &mdash; its modeled, red wordmark slicing through a Giant &#8220;G&#8221; &mdash; it&#8217;s clunky, dated and a bit over-beveled if you had asked me on the street. And while I feel like the red and green shapes of Stop &amp; Shop could have had new life breathed into it, it would have only solved half the problem. While this new identity system is colorful and has slightly better typography (save the terrible setting of &#8220;Stop&#038;Shop&#8221;), the real advantage is that it is able to minimize overhead costs by working for both chains without the loss of either name. To that point, some success &mdash; as for determining what the logo is&hellip; your guess is as good as mine &mdash; clearly this is not a logo with the kind of long-term recognition that the traffic-accident-inducing red and green logo of old had.<br \/>\n <br \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/stopshop_anim_01.gif\" alt=\"Animation by Superfad\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/stopshop_anim_02.gif\" alt=\"Animation by Superfad\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/stopshop_anim_03.gif\" alt=\"Animation by Superfad\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/stopshop_anim_04.gif\" alt=\"Animation by Superfad\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/stopshop_anim_05.gif\" alt=\"Animation by Superfad\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Stills from an <a href=\"http:\/\/superfad.com\/player.php?project=206&#038;item=434\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">animation developed by S&uuml;perfad<\/a>.
