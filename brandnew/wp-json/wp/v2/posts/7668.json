The Dukes compete in Division I of the NCAA &#8212; six men&#8217;s teams and eleven women&#8217;s &#8212; as members of the Atlantic 10 Conference and while not as popular as other college teams they have enjoyed quiet, relative success over the years.

It was designed to convey a sense of pride, strength and ferocity as well as pay homage to our heritage.<br \/><br \/>The narrow, angular features gives the monogram a gothic aesthetic and echoes our Spiritan flame.

First, I&#8217;ll address the old logos, which were fine but unsurprising within the world of college sports and the blackletter &#8220;D&#8221; perhaps played too much off of the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Detroit_Tigers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Detroit Tigers<\/a> logo.<\/p>\n<p>The new logos are also unsurprising within the realm of college sports identities as they all rely on the tried and true condensed spiky aesthetic but, for the first time in a long time, I actually reacted positively to it as I think the different marks all add a new take on it. The primary monogram is bold and confident and the exaggerated angles that create an extra tall letter make it quite different from anything else out there. It&#8217;s unapologetically sharp and aggressive but somewhat elegant &#8212; the one thing that doesn&#8217;t work are the multiple strokes placed around it in some instances as it takes away its impact. The full wordmark complements the monogram and does a great job in NOT repeating the &#8220;D&#8221;. The &#8220;Q&#8221; is quite awesome and the rest of the characters are pretty well done. The shorthand &#8220;DUQ&#8221; is pretty great and I love how it&#8217;s symmetric yet asymmetric. It&#8217;s a sturdy, cohesive set of marks that speak the college sports language but, metaphorically speaking, with its own unique accent.<\/p>\n<blockquote>[The Bluff] typeface is named as a nod to Duquesne&#8217;s unique geographic location in Pittsburgh. Strong and condensed, with an aggressive appearance that comes through angled terminals, spiked serifs and wedge-shaped counter forms, this is a custom typeface built to complement our monogram and wordmarks. The numerals were designed to appear on uniforms for complete customization.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/spark.adobe.com\/page\/FiMahSptQosjr\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Duquesne Dukes microsite<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/duquesne_custom_font.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Duquesne University Athletics by ChangeUp\" \/>\n<figcaption>Custom typeface, The Bluff.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/duquesne_custom_font_sans.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Duquesne University Athletics by ChangeUp\" \/>\n<figcaption>Complementary typeface, <a href=\"https:\/\/playtype.com\/index.php?q=font\/wave\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Wave<\/a> by Playtype.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The headline custom typeface loses some of the uniqueness achieved in the logos and starts to look more like the rest of the condensed spiky fonts.

In the dark blue photographs I love how the monogram appears to be casting a red hue on the athletes while the word casts a white glow. They are very sport-y photos but they are strikingly executed. The white posters are pretty awesome too, with the large monogram smack in the middle and interacting with the photography, all in a nice crisp layout.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/duquesne_helmets.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Duquesne University Athletics by ChangeUp\" \/>\n<figcaption>Helmets.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/duquesne_uniforms_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Duquesne University Athletics by ChangeUp\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/duquesne_uniforms_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Duquesne University Athletics by ChangeUp\" \/>\n<figcaption>Uniforms.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Uniforms are good. I don&#8217;t have much else to say. Fun fact that was shared with me: &#8220;Duquesne&#8217;s basketball coach was LeBron James&#8217; high school coach, so Duquesne is one of only two schools (Ohio State being the other) that gets to wear the Nike\/LeBron gear&#8221;.\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/duquesne_swag_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Duquesne University Athletics by ChangeUp\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/duquesne_swag_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Duquesne University Athletics by ChangeUp\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/duquesne_swag_04.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Duquesne University Athletics by ChangeUp\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/duquesne_swag_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Duquesne University Athletics by ChangeUp\" \/>\n<figcaption>Swag.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/duquesne_logo_court.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Duquesne University Athletics by ChangeUp\" \/>\n<figcaption>Monogram, center court.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/duquesne_overview.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Duquesne University Athletics by ChangeUp\" \/>\n<figcaption>Overview.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">Overall, as you might imagine my conclusion to be, I like this quite a bit.
