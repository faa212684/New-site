And, oh, that&#8217;s not Dublin, Ireland, which would at least put them in the same continent; no, Vesha Law is in Dublin, <em>Ohio<\/em>. Anyway, &#8220;connection&#8221; seems to be the key word here, as for brands&trade; has designed a remarkably interesting logo for a law firm with a super simplified V &mdash; L (both the same shape) connected through a long line. It works great on their website, anchoring the bottom left of the page and it looks so good as a three-dimensional sign at their office. The dark grays and copper palette make for a very sophisticated combination that makes this law firm look lawyer-y but also a bit badass. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.forbrands.pl\/projects\/vesha-law\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project here<\/strong><\/a><\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Costello &amp; Hellerstein by Robot Food<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_costellohellerstein.jpg\" alt=\"Costello &amp; Hellerstein by Robot Food\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">&#8220;Exquisite chocolate truffle masterpieces&#8221;. That&#8217;s the title of the home page of London-based <a href=\"http:\/\/costelloandhellerstein.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cost&egrave;llo + Hellerstein<\/a>. Chocolate truffles are already exquisite (even the cheap-o kind) but these are <em>masterpieces<\/em> and from the looks of it, I believe it. To add that touch of masterpieciness, local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.robot-food.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Robot Food<\/a> generated their own marble pattern that they digitized and applied to the small white boxes that house the four flavors of truffles. The boxes are finished off with a simple wordmark (although I&#8217;m not sure about that ladder &#8220;H&#8221;) and a small band with the flavor. It&#8217;s a little Anagrama-ish, but that&#8217;s not the worst thing one might say about someone else&#8217;s work. Plus, people: truffles!

Hence, all the toy imagery chosen over hop and barley imagery by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.castirondesign.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cast Iron Design<\/a>, who have created a vibrant and playful identity and packaging that breaks away from the typical look of craft brews. One element that makes this work so well is the choice of <a href=\"http:\/\/grillitype.com\/typefaces\/gt-walsheim\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Grilli Type&#8217;s Walsheim<\/a> which, in its bold, black, and ultra weights packs a big deal of personality on its own, making the kind of beer on each can very very alluring. But perhaps the best compliment comes from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/dfxm326\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dan McGorry<\/a> who wrote to Brand New, saying &#8220;I was in Colorado recently and picked up a six-pack of this local beer, based solely on the packaging (of course.)&#8221; Of course. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.castirondesign.com\/work\/finkel-and-garf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Today we start with business up front and end with a party in the back with work from Poznan, London, and Boulder&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[1122,967,53],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3760"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3760"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3760\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3760"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3760"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3760"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
