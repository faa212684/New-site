Organized by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fide.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FIDE<\/a> (F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale des \u00c9checs or World Chess Federation), the game has been played every other year since 2006 in different cities around the world. (From scanning the Wikipedia page, the championship has been riddled with soap opera drama for most of its existence.) Earlier this week, FIDE held an event to <a href=\"https:\/\/worldchess.com\/2017\/12\/17\/branding-for-the-2018-match-unveiled\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">announce<\/a> the location &#8212; London, UK &#8212; of the 2018 Championship match and introduced a new identity designed by Moscow, Russia-based <a href=\"https:\/\/shuka.design\/world-chess-london\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Shuka Design<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><p>First, you might wonder why a chess game is getting the full Review treatment&#8230; Halfway down the post you&#8217;ll see why, as part of the identity has gone viral because, well, you&#8217;ll see, but I think that, drowned in the noise, there is a remarkably cool identity that is way better than it probably needs to be. Also, this is the last Review of the year &#8212; our holiday break starts tomorrow (we will be posting Best\/Worst of The Year through the next two weeks) &#8212; so I didn&#8217;t mind ending the year on a lighter note.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fide_world_chess_championship_2016_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2018 World Chess Championship by Shuka Design\" \/>\n<figcaption><strong>2016<\/strong> World Chess Championship logo.

The new logo draws from the patterned texture of the World Chess organization (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.pentagram.com\/work\/world-chess\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">designed by Pentagram<\/a>) to create an intricate illustration of hands interlocking over a board. There is perhaps one hand too many &#8212; since there are only two players and the maximum number of hands possible would be four &#8212; but I love the tension that the visual creates and the idea of the hands tangling in chess combat. The plain version without the textures is pretty cool too.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fide_world_chess_championship_2018_wall.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2018 World Chess Championship by Shuka Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Event signage.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fide_world_chess_championship_2018_event.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2018 World Chess Championship by Shuka Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Backdrop. &#8220;World Chess Champion Magnus Carlsen attends the FIDE World Chess event announcing London to host 2018 FIDE World Chess Championship Match.

Yes, it is super weird. Yes, it is super distracting from the event. Yes, it is utterly gratuitous. Yes, it is unfathomable to consider playing a round of chess while consensually scissoring.
