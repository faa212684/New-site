Refining their products all through the decade, it changed its name to the more intimidating name of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.f-secure.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">F-Secure<\/a> and has become an important player in the development of computer and mobile device protection and antivirus products. This past September, it launched a new identity.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/f-secure_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"F-Secure\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Other than <a href=\"http:\/\/www.f-secure.com\/weblog\/archives\/00001762.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this light blog post<\/a>, there isn&#8217;t much information to go on but, what&#8217;s certain, is that the old superhero logo had to go, even more so when all big corporations are going with softer identities. And, in that regard, this logo is a success: instead of the harsh, pointy and dangerous corners of the old icon is a ribbon-like &#8220;F&#8221; that might as well be used to wrap the computer up in a pretty package and hand it to data miners; and instead of good ol&#8217; Futura Extra Bold is a new, custom type family called F-Secure Sans that is described &mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.f-secure.com\/system\/fsgalleries\/pr-documents\/FS_Brand_Identity_Guidelines_090901_condensed.pdf\">in the identity guidelines<\/a> [PDF] &mdash; as a &#8220;modern sans design, forward-looking but not futuristic, precise but not cold and geometric, consistent but not soulless,&#8221; aka soft and rounded.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/f-secure_type.gif\" alt=\"F-Secure\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The overall identity is actually not bad, it does have a nice feel to it but, at least for me, it&#8217;s hard to get past the awkwardness of the icon. It&#8217;s <em>almost there<\/em> but the way the ribbon curves does not feel natural. The way the top corners on the right are squared and the bottom rounded but both corners on the left side are rounded is too inconsistent and how the bottom part of the stem is drawn feels too forced. The logo looks rather nice in full color on top of the dark blue background but then you see the 1-color application and it looks clunky at best. The type family is nice, an interesting cross between Dax and Gill Sans that does elevate the whole project.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/f-secure_logos.gif\" alt=\"F-Secure\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/f-secure_packaging.jpg\" alt=\"F-Secure\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to Lauri Haavisto for the tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_20091029_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_20091029_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_20091029_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_20091029_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,26,88],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/958"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=958"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/958\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=958"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=958"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=958"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
