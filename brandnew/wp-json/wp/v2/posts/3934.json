It underlines the differentiated brand identity, is very flexible and, through animation, is given a dynamic component.  For all of the national languages in Switzerland a direct, uncomplicated and simultaneously striking tone was developed.<\/blockquote><h3>Prophet provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/salt_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Salt by Prophet London\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Despite all the press releases and news stories there is no clear explanation of why they chose the name Salt (or perhaps my German is not good enough to find the answer) but I think it&#8217;s quite literally called Salt to give the market some flavor. Going from Orange to Salt is a lateral move in choosing another daily-life item that sounds irreverent as a company name. Orange, of course, has become one of the most well-known brands in Europe and Salt is probably betting (hoping) it can achieve the same kind of ubiquity using the same branding tactic.<\/p>\n<p>The new logo is the word Salt, period, typeset in Jeremy Mickel&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/vllg.com\/mckl\/superior-title\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Superior<\/a>. It&#8217;s a beautiful typeface that makes for a very forgettable logo. Again, not very different from the minimalist Orange logo, but at least orange had the orange square behind. To Salt&#8217;s and Publicis&#8217; credit, at least it&#8217;s not another chunky sans serif wordmark.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/salt_sim_cards.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Salt by Prophet London\" \/>\n<figcaption>SIM cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/salt_publication.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Salt by Prophet London\" \/>\n<figcaption>Some kind of publication.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The identity starts strong with some of these more corporate applications, with no supporting graphics and just straight-up type. Not much to get excited about but a nice enough, hipster attitude. With the more consumer-driven materials, however, things get a little wonky.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/salt_logo_elements.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Salt by Prophet London\" \/>\n<figcaption>Identity elements.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/salt_ads.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Salt by Prophet London\" \/>\n<figcaption>Ads.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/0EKLQaDAw7Q\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Launch spot, man says &#8220;Orange is now called Salt&#8221;.

A stronger identity system would have been needed to take the rather dry logo into more interesting territory.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/salt_new_store.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Salt by Prophet London\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sample of new stores.

It&#8217;s Salt trying to be edgy and to a degree it works, but it also feels like it lacks context or even a strong point to make along with the new name. The TV spots and ads all say &#8220;Orange is now called Salt&#8221; but they never bother to provide a pay-off. Overall, it&#8217;s great that they took a chance with something different but it falls short on impact and meaning.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Orange entered the telecommunications market in Switzerland in 1999 as the third mobile operator and has to grown to 1.6 million customers.
