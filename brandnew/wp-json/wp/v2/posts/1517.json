Available above 10,000 ft. over U.S. air space Gogo provides access to the Web, e-mail, instant messaging, and corporate VPNs. Gogo is available on all AirTran Airways and Virgin America flights, and select Air Canada, Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, Delta, Frontier, United, and US Airways flights with various pricing options.<\/p><!--more--><p>Earlier this month an <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jaunted.com\/story\/2011\/6\/6\/13453\/38006\/travel\/Inside+Gogo+InFlight%3A+A+New+Gogo+Logo+and+What%27s+Next+for+WiFi+in+the+Skies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">article<\/a> was published detailing what&#8217;s to come in the next generation of Gogo Inflight Service. The big change coming is streaming entertainment and shopping, lessening the relevance of airline provided seatback TVs. New inflight entertainment options are exciting, but what really caught my eye within this article was a new Gogo logo described as &#8220;secret&#8221;. We have patiently waited for the official release of this new logo by Aircell, which occurred last week in <a href=\"http:\/\/app.go.gogoinflight.com\/e\/es.aspx?s=818&#038;e=406323&#038;elq=3f0c029a264440f2a11ffcd42ac2b913\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">an e-blast<\/a> to current Gogo customers.<\/p>\n<p>The previous logo which was trite with an odd color choice for a service provided in the sky. This has been replaced with a new logo that has a softer typographic approach, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.apple.com\/icloud\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">an iCloud-like symbol<\/a>, a new color scheme, and a new tagline. The new logo is an improvement, but could have been much better in my opinion. The connections between the letterforms are stiff and lack strong interconnectivity and fluidity. The symbol is a little weird and leaves me asking if it is a path I should follow and the very subtle blend in the red will surely look like an error in print. They did however greatly improve the color scheme, sky blue just seems right!<\/p>\n<p>The oddest part of this rebranding is the lack of a very important element any new brand launch requires, coordination. Aircell allowed, and seemingly endorsed, the new logo to be leaked pre-launch as well as pushed out the new logo in an email campaign with a link that goes to the old  website that has no mention of anything new. Further, in the e-blast they have announced a new domain, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gogoair.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">www.gogoair.com<\/a>, which just points to the legacy site. This leads me to believe they are fully dropping their descriptive tagline &#8220;Inflight Internet&#8221; and replacing it full time with the somewhat more abstract &#8220;In Air. Online.&#8221; I hope they have done their homework and have validated that the majority of the U.S. domestic travelers know what Gogo is and know what &#8220;in Air. Online&#8221; means and that there will be a few associated with it.<\/p>\n<div class=\"bottom\">Roy Levitt is a brand identity specialist and design expert dedicated to building brands that define, inspire, support, and transform organizations.
