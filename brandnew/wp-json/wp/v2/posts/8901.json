This effort has been spearheaded by the Nation Brand Advisory Council, &#8220;formed in June 2018, includes twelve of Australia&#8217;s most influential leaders from diverse industries. The Advisory Council has a strategic advisory and advocacy role. The Council has met eight times from June 2018 to October 2019 and were also supported by the Brand Expert Working Group to ensure that Australia&#8217;s Nation Brand was designed by industry for industry. Australia&#8217;s Nation Brand Advisory Council led this initiative. The Council is committed to providing ongoing advocacy for the adoption of Australia&#8217;s Nation Brand, either in the organisations they lead or the influence they carry in their industry or community. The Council members, together with other leaders of small, medium and large internationally-facing Australian businesses, stand ready to support the adoption of the Nation Brand in various ways.&#8221;<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/australia_nation_brand_logo.jpg\" alt=\"New Nation Brand for Australia by Clemenger BBDO\" \/>\n<figcaption>Primary logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/australia_nation_brand_logo_horizontal.jpg\" alt=\"New Nation Brand for Australia by Clemenger BBDO\" \/>\n<figcaption>Horizontal versions.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/australia_nation_brand_logo_alternates.jpg\" alt=\"New Nation Brand for Australia by Clemenger BBDO\" \/>\n<figcaption>Alternates for countries where &#8220;AU&#8221; did not test well.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/australia_nation_brand_explanation_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Nation Brand for Australia by Clemenger BBDO\" \/>\n<figcaption>Long explanation from Nation Brand Advisory Council Recommendation document.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/australia_nation_brand_explanation_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Nation Brand for Australia by Clemenger BBDO\" \/>\n<figcaption>Same.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/australia_nation_brand_applications_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Nation Brand for Australia by Clemenger BBDO\" \/>\n<figcaption>Painfully low resolution applications.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/australia_nation_other_logos.jpg\" alt=\"New Nation Brand for Australia by Clemenger BBDO\" \/>\n<figcaption>The two other existing international-facing logos.
