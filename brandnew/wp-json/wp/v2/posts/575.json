And, finally, please forget about that pixelated X that became one of the best known and widely recognized icons. All that is a thing of the past. Yes, just the past four decades. Poor Xerox, so misunderstood, so verbalized &mdash; &#8220;Can you xerox this for me? Thanks intern&#8221; &mdash; so outdated. Yet, if you worked anywhere with one of those multi-tasking, short of coffee-making machines, you know that Xerox can do more (way more) than make black and white copies of your spreadsheets. Yet, apparently, few people realize this. And nothing cures ailments like these better than a rebranding. Unveiled today, the new identity, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.interbrand.com\/portfolio_details.asp?portfolio=3096&#038;language=ID\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">designed by Interbrand<\/a>, for Xerox may signal a new era for the company but, as far as we designers are concerned, it merely signals the full embrace of the senseless threedimensionalization of the corporate world.<\/p><!--more--><p>If you can stomach a little press-releasing, here is some:<\/p>\n<blockquote>The new Xerox logo is now a lowercase treatment of the Xerox name &mdash; in a vibrant red &mdash; alongside a sphere-shaped symbol sketched with lines that link to form an illustrative &#8220;X,&#8221; representing Xerox&#8217;s connections to its customers, partners, industry and innovation, and designed to be more effectively animated for use in multi-media platforms.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xerox.com\/go\/xrx\/template\/inv_rel_newsroom.jsp?app=Newsroom&#038;ed_name=NR_2008Jan07_Xerox_Reveals_New_Brand_Logo&#038;format=article&#038;view=newsrelease&#038;Xcntry=USA&#038;Xlang=en_US\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Official press release<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Signaling a clear change and evoking a dramatic shift in the world&#8217;s perception of this iconic brand, the visual and verbal identity system for Xerox has undergone a massive redesign.

The short-lived digitized X on the other hand was incredibly communicative and expressive of the place that Xerox occupied at the moment &mdash; bridging new and old technologies and processes &mdash; but at the same time, despite nostalgia, the pixelation effect was probably as clich&eacute;d then as these electric bugaloos are today. The Xerox wordmark was in serious need of an update and, letter for letter (except for the &#8220;r&#8221;), this new wordmark does an amazing job. Those &#8220;x&#8221;s are to die for. A wise move would have been to simply move forward with the wordmark, placing emphasis and importance on the word Xerox, which has plenty of equity. But instead we had to be graced with the introduction of this furious marble that is downright abominable and meaningless but come to think of it, it does take my mind off of &#8220;the copier company&#8221;.
