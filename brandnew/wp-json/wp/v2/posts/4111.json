What makes this unique is that the circle has hard angles, giving it a very interesting faceted look. From afar it doesn&#8217;t really make a difference but up close and with all the pitch-perfect production methods used, the logo is luxurious and serene. The custom typography &mdash; that you can see more of in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/27233379\/SOIN-DE-SOI-TYPOGRAPHY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this separate project page<\/a> &mdash; while not my favorite, adds a touch of high-end quirk that makes the full identity stand out beyond just trying to come across as fancifully minimal. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/27235763\/SOIN-DE-SOI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">EKOCYCLE by Son&amp;Sons<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_ekocycle.jpg\" alt=\"EKOCYCLE by Son&amp;Sons\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">This may be a little off-brand for my usual Friday Likes as it&#8217;s a relatively large endeavor started by Coca-Cola and will.i.am. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ekocycle.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">EKOCYCLE<\/a> encourages &#8220;recycling behavior and sustainability among consumers through aspirational, yet attainable lifestyle products made in part from recycled material.&#8221; They partner with other brands to create products that carry the organization&#8217;s logo in not just an endorsing manner but as a defining fashion element like, say Louis Vuitton. Designed by Atlanta, GA-based <a href=\"http:\/\/sonandsons.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Son&amp;Sons<\/a> the logo &#8220;celebrates the strength of a community working together toward a shared goal&#8221;. To be honest, I don&#8217;t know how it does that or what exactly the logo is. It says EKO from bottom to top and sideways but it looks more like a cyclist raising his\/her hands. Nonetheless, it&#8217;s a catchy logo. It simply <em>looks<\/em> good and more importantly it pairs very well with other brands and it looks very nice as a pattern. For a corporate-driven identity this feels remarkably genuine and I would totally wear those swim trunks. <a href=\"http:\/\/sonandsons.com\/work\/ekocycle\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Bibelot by A Friend of Mine<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_bibelot.jpg\" alt=\"Bibelot by a Friend of Mine\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bibelot.com.au\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bibelot<\/a> is a luxury european-inspired dessert boutique in Melbourne, Australia, with a stunning identity designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/afom.com.au\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A Friend of Mine<\/a>. Based on tile work, the otherwise contemporary sans serif takes on a great classic look that makes it seem as if this store has existed forever. The patterns, especially the one with the overlapping circles, make beautiful textures that look fantastic on the wall or wrapped around boxes. The bottom-right placement of the logo is unexpected and helps break what would have been a lot of symmetry. A serving of any of Bibelot&#8217;s treats would go perfect after coming out of Soin de Soi. <strong><a href=\"http:\/\/afom.com.au\/work\/bibelot\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/strong><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Mostly minimal work that goes from spare to dense applications this week, with work from Bordeaux, Atlanta, and Melbourne&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[729,753,1176],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4111"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4111"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4111\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4111"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4111"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4111"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
