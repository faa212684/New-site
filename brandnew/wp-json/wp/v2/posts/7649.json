Unlike the usual conveyor belt sushi, this is high-end, seriously crafted sushi. With an interior that references underwater themes and science fiction, the identity, designed by Vancouver-based <a href=\"https:\/\/glasfurdandwalker.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Glasfurd &amp; Walker<\/a>, manages to hit on those themes with a strong Japanese aesthetic. At the center is a beautiful wordmark with an unexpected &#8220;R&#8221; that looks great in a vertical arrangement and the thin stroke around is a great complement. The moody, textural background is a great alternative to the more usual gradients. The wordmark was expanded into a full alphabet in collaboration with <a href=\"https:\/\/kennethormandy.com\/portfolio\/aburi-tora-custom-display-typeface\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kenneth Ormandy<\/a> and aside from being a lovely high-contrast sans serif, it has a few surprises in some of the characters. As a bonus to the project, the soy sauce bottle is all kinds of groovy. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/glasfurdandwalker.com\/project\/aburi-tora\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Linn House by Touch<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_linnhouse.jpg\" alt=\"Linn House by Touch\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">Linn House &#8212; no website for it but you can see some pictures <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theviennablog.com\/2017\/07\/28\/exploring-the-home-of-chivas-regal-whisky-in-scotland\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a> &#8212; is a nineteenth-century mansion in Strathspey, in northeastern Scotland, owned by distiller Chivas Brothers as its &#8220;brand home&#8221; where they host guests and events. The identity, designed by Edinburgh, Scotland-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thetouchagency.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Touch<\/a>, is as beautifully appointed as the mansion&#8217;s interiors with a thin, elegant, perfectly spaced serif and a thin gold line that runs vertically across the materials. I think the golden line is meant to represent a pour of whiskey, which is fine if it does, but I&#8217;m also happy to take it at face value as an elegant, foil stamped design detail. My only complaint is that I wish there were more images to see and that it&#8217;s a long road to drinking time today as I write this at 6:00am. So I guess that&#8217;s two complaints total. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thetouchagency.co.uk\/project\/linn-house\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Texas Children&#8217;s &#8220;Hi&#8221; by SPARK<\/h1>\n<img src=\"[wbcr_php_snippet id='187' title='Image Path']archives\/friday_likes_texaschildrenhi.jpg\" alt=\"Texas Children's \"Hi\" by SPARK\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">And now for something different (client-wise)&#8230; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.texaschildrens.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Texas Children&#8217;s Hospital<\/a> is a pediatric hospital in the Texas Medical Center in Houston, TX, and the reason we are talking about a hospital in Friday Likes is because of their new employee orientation materials, which they have developed into its own mini-brand, &#8220;Hi&#8221;, designed by Tampa, FL-based <a href=\"https:\/\/spark.us\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SPARK<\/a>. Usually materials for these things are cheap throwaway printouts and bad swag but this is super cool, with a hip school-ish aesthetic, some fun typographic combinations, and excellent swag that includes pins, pennants, t-shirts, and paper megaphone. I know this isn&#8217;t as exciting or highfalutin as restaurants or hotels but it&#8217;s a great example of good, fun design used to elevate something mundane and make it more memorable and significant. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/spark.us\/projects\/tc-hi\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Not to repeat my intro from a couple of weeks ago but the same applies this week: A pretty wide variety of styles and approaches this week, with work from Vancouver, Edinburgh, and Tampa Bay&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,73,85,26],"tags":[1293,438,564],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7649"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=7649"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7649\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=7649"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=7649"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=7649"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
