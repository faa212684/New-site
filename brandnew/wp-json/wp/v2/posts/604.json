(As a side note, do check out <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sicksack.com\/bags\/bag-0278.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a barf bag with an old SEA logo<\/a>). The old identity was not particularly good: With its Valentine&#8217;s Day theme and mini airplane blowing smokehearts out of its behind, feels too cute for its own good. But the new one is plain (get it? plain = plane?) disastrous: It uses the tail of an airplane as part of its logo, something that seems awfully redundant; the shiny &#8220;S&#8221; appears to have some odd dimension that makes it look like a double wedge; and, by itself, the &#8220;S&#8221; is rather unpleasant looking. Unfortunately, there aren&#8217;t too many saving graces to this logo, other than, perhaps, it&#8217;s ultra confident new slogan, &#8220;We would fly with us&#8221;, which I do like. Below you can see old and new versions of the livery&hellip; including the even more unfortunate execution of the backwards-slanted &#8220;S&#8221; to fit the other side of the tail. <em>!teewS<\/em>.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sterling_airlines_livery_old.jpg\" alt=\"Sterling Airlines Livery, Old\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sterling_airlines_livery_new.jpg\" alt=\"Sterling Airlines Livery, New\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/nordicflights.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">James Campbell<\/a> for the tip.<\/strong><span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[60,9,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/604"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=604"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/604\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=604"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=604"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=604"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
