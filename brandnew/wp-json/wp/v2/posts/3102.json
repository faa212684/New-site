It&#8217;s eye-catching in its cropped approach and once you see the logo connecting with other logos or words or as part of a phrase it works wonders. The typeface choice &mdash; straight up DIN? &mdash; could have been a little more inspired in terms of finding something with a nudge more character but, really, this is perfectly fine.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/agda_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for AGDA by Interbrand\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/agda_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for AGDA by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo with words.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/agda_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for AGDA by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.
