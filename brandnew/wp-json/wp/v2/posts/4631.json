I&#8217;ll be there first to admit that the identity is a tad dry and that most of my attraction is to the wonderful characters but since they are (at) the heart of the identity then I&#8217;ll stand behind its inclusion here. I love their simplicity, playfulness, and just-the-right-amount of texture. They pair very well with the simple &#8220;eenymeeny&#8221; wordmark that, itself, has a very pleasant rhythm. Maybe when they open another store they can call it minymoe and introduce two new characters. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.creativereview.co.uk\/cr-blog\/2016\/april\/iya-studio-and-jack-cunninghams-playful-identity-for-childrens-brand-eenymeeny\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Alias by The Potting Shed<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_alias_beer_2.jpg\" alt=\"Alias by The Potting Shed\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">Alias is the first beer of <a href=\"http:\/\/winslowbrewco.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Winslow Brew Co.<\/a>, a micro-micro-brewery in Switzerland, made with British people and the UK market in mind. Designed by Jersey and Guernsey, UK-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thepottingsheddesign.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Potting Shed Design<\/a>, the identity brings to life the idea of &#8220;alias&#8221; as living under different names and guises. The main visual device is a combination of classic typography &#8220;A&#8221;s rendered in silver, overlaid with different, more visually expressive &#8220;A&#8221;s in red &#8212; the aliases. It&#8217;s a clever concept &#8212; granted, needs explaining &#8212; and it&#8217;s very nicely executed, with the silver and red combo working equally well on white and kraft surfaces. If you are looking for me, I&#8217;ll be hiding under the pixel A alias. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thepottingsheddesign.com\/2016\/04\/13\/alias-well-crafted\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Freewheel by Collins<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_freewheel.jpg\" alt=\"Freewheel by Collins\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/freewheel.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Freewheel<\/a> is a new smartphone from Optimum that only works through Wi-Fi, lowering costs from traditional carriers. Designed by New York, NY-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wearecollins.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Collins<\/a>, &#8220;The energetic lines on the packaging express the idea of a free and strong wifi signal that is available almost everywhere&#8221; and energetic they are. The packaging looks vibrant and exciting while also coming across as&hellip; &#8220;cheap&#8221;. Meant as a compliment! It&#8217;s not a fuzzy iPhone box, it looks like something affordable and within reach. My favorite aspect of the identity, though, is the straight line device that flows into the &#8220;F&#8221; of the logo, looking almost like a flag. The overall feel reminds of something that I can&#8217;t put my finger on&hellip; it&#8217;s like if IBM and LaCoste had a baby brand. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wearecollins.com\/work\/freewheel\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Colorful, playful, and energetic projects today with work from London, Guernsey, and New York&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[184,311,905],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4631"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4631"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4631\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4631"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4631"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4631"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
