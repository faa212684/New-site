The design team selected a lush green as PhotoShelter&#8217;s official color to emanate life and the freshness of the company&#8217;s products and thinking.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/psc.photoshelter.com\/about\/index\/news\/20081105\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">From Press Release<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p>Where this logo falls short is in its execution. Conceptually the &ldquo;shelter&rdquo; is a viable idea that marries well with their company&#8217;s mission, however the rendering yields a rather flimsy shape that seems less solid and\/or protective. One of the visual extensions of the logo&#8217;s form is the speech bubble, which you can see employed on the PhotoShelter web site in the footer, and while it&#8217;s possible that this could become an ownable graphic device for PhotoShelter (as much as speech bubbles can be owned these days), the opportunity seems rather under-explored.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/photoshelter_tshirt.jpg\" alt=\"Photoshelter T-shirt\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>T-shirt image swiped from Cinco Design&#8217;s blog, <a href=\"http:\/\/cincodesign.com\/culture\/2008\/03\/13\/photoshelter-rebranding\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">where they have a post about working on the project<\/a>.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The typography got an update as well &mdash; darker, bolder and without the potentially dated CamelCase. Where this new typography is extended into the body of the web site its seems to work well through bringing a more authoritative visual voice than they had previously. However, the trade-off in the case of the logotype is decreased legibility (a product of the all-caps setting with its tight kerning) and less personality. While the original typography was far too light in value, the mixed-case was easier to read and the typeface had more character. Overall this redesign comes to life on their web site where the bold typography and colors are designed into a more lively layout &mdash; which is likely a visual language that can be extended into other collateral, however the logo itself will have a long road to travel to communicate the identity and attributes of the company to their audience.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":4,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,78,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/616"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/4"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=616"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/616\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=616"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=616"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=616"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
