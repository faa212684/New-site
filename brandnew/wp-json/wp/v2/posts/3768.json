Earlier this month, the bank dropped Banco from its name, going solely by Popular, and introduced a new identity designed by the Madrid office of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.brandunion.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brand Union<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Q6X-ZaFVUA8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo evolution. <\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The bank&#8217;s name has been simplified from &#8216;Banco Popular&#8217; to just &#8216;Popular&#8217;, and was revealed alongside a new positioning and visual identity, symbolising the bank&#8217;s plans for the future. The new brand was presented at a press conference at Abelias, the corporate headquarters in Madrid.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.brandunion.com\/insight\/press-release\/brand-union-strengthens-brand-leading-spanish-bank-popular\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brand Union press release<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/banco_popular_logo_detail_alt.png\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Popular by Brand Union\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail, with tagline &#8220;Con paso firme&#8221; (<em>Firmly forward<em>).<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The identity itself takes on a typographic form in a bid to express the determination of an expert bank. The upward line device reflects the banks evolution and growth, whilst the graphical system of illustrations, pictures and type brings freshness and versatility to the visual language.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.brandunion.com\/insight\/press-release\/brand-union-strengthens-brand-leading-spanish-bank-popular\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brand Union press release<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/banco_popular_logo_construction.gif\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Popular by Brand Union\" \/>\n<figcaption>Wordmark construction. Anyone know what the original font is?<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>What&#8217;s most sad about the previous logo is what they did to it in the last ten years, first by placing it inside a holding shape then iTunizing it with dumb shadows and highlights. It wasn&#8217;t the best logo to start with but neither of these moves helped make it any better. I&#8217;m sure there was plenty of equity in the angled &#8220;P&#8221; but it had lost importance within the logo itself. The new logo is a pretty straightforward serif wordmark. It&#8217;s a handsome one. It&#8217;s bold but not too bold, it&#8217;s slab-ey but not too slab-ey, it&#8217;s well-spaced, and it&#8217;s set in a strong color that stands out. It&#8217;s not super exciting but I like it.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/RNPwL9CBOec\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>New brand video.

You don&#8217;t need a degree in anything to get its meaning. The line is used to lock up the wordmark with the tagline and for ad messaging. I have the sense most people here will not take kindly to the line but it&#8217;s a simple visual device that is distinct enough to establish a recognizable element for Popular. Case in point: see the bus wrap and window posters above. They stand out quite glaringly &mdash; also because of the heavy use of white and white space &mdash; and set a very clear connection between all communications. The print brochure above those (whether real or not) is quite clever and shows the potential of the upward line as a playful and elegant element. Overall, this is a bold change that maintains the seriousness of the bank while establishing a more confident visual language.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1926, Banco Popular (Popular Bank) is one of the biggest bank groups in Spain with presence in its home country and the rest of Europe &mdash; 2,000 and 200 retail locations respectively, with more than 15,000 employees.
