I had every intention of posting but last night (Wednesday) we had a huge thunderstorm that knocked out our power around 8:00 pm. I figured the power would come back up overnight but, as you may have guessed it, it didn&#8217;t. Then I figured the power would come back up before noon and I could prepare for Friday&#8217;s post but, correct again, it didn&#8217;t. Then a power utility truck pulled up and saw that a power line was down, right on our driveway of all places, and then the truck left. It&#8217;s been almost 24 hours and the power is still out so I have lost hope it will come back by tomorrow. So I am preemptively warning you there will be no posts tomorrow. Normally I could go to a coffee shop and do it there but I can&#8217;t go anywhere, now, can I? So&#8230; yeah. We&#8217;ll come back on Monday. Fingers crossed.<\/p>\n<p><strong>tl;dr<\/strong> There is no electricity in our house (22 hours and counting), can&#8217;t leave house, can&#8217;t prepare posts.
