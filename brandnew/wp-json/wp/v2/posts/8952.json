Their identity, designed by local firm <a href=\"https:\/\/sabbath.mx\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sabbath<\/a>, is &#8220;inspired by Dystopian Futures, Cyberpunk, Sci-fi \/ Neo-noir Cult Films &amp; Anime themed aesthetics&#8221; which I didn&#8217;t realize was a range of inspirations that could be mixed together but now I know what that looks like and I&#8217;m here for it. The photos of the applications are a little like that <em>Game of Thrones<\/em> episode that was so dark that you couldn&#8217;t see anything but you could tell cool stuff was happening&#8230; that&#8217;s the feeling I get here: I&#8217;m not totally sure what&#8217;s going on but I like the overall vibe and the bursts of neon green and <em>that blue<\/em> amidst a sea of blackness. Paired with the Daft Punk-meets-<em>Minority Report<\/em>-meets-<em>The Matrix<\/em> photography at the link, I&#8217;m definitely enjoying the mood simply for it being so out there &#8212; like the truth.  <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sabbath.mx\/paradigmal\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Pelican by Luminous Design Group<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_pelican_a.jpg\" alt=\"Pelican by Luminous Design Group\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/pelicanmykonos\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pelican<\/a> is an all-day caf\u00e9 bar-restaurant, located at the Old Port of Mykonos, Greece. The identity, designed by Athens, Greece-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.luminous.gr\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Luminous Design Group<\/a>, features a handful of abstracted pelican icons\/illustrations that, like the pelicans in Mynokos&#8217; Old Port that walk amongst humans, mingle with the other design elements. I&#8217;ll admit that this is all mostly a lot of design flair for the sake of it but the combinations are all fairly satisfying if you don&#8217;t mind the trendiness &#8212; otherwise, you can tell the pelicans that they <em>pelican&#8217;t<\/em> do what they are doing.

Their identity, designed by local firm <a href=\"https:\/\/gletsch.com\/de\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gletscher<\/a>, channels that simplicity by using a single weight of <a href=\"https:\/\/abcdinamo.com\/typefaces\/whyte\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Whyte<\/a> with only one, subtle design gesture that takes advantage of the shared initial three letters in the two words of their name, &#8220;Stu&#8221;, to split them into opposite ends of the layout. With &#8220;Studio&#8221; being such a common word it makes the challenge of reading the full name easy and satisfying. A simple color palette of black, tan, and light brown evokes their style of architecture and looks Stu&#8230; pendous.
