Since it received positive feedback in the comments and polls I figured you would enjoy seeing these. To quickly summarize: Founded in 1818, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.slu.edu\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SLU<\/a> is a private university in St. Louis, MO, with 13,000 students and offering all the degrees and different schools that most large universities offer. Their athletics teams, the Saint Louis Billikens, compete in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association. The new identity was designed by Minneapolis, MN-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.olson.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Olson<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/saint_louis_university_followup_logo_detail.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Identity for Saint Louis University by Olson\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>We&#8217;ll skip talking about the logo as we already did yesterday.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/saint_louis_university_followup_stationery.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Identity for Saint Louis University by Olson\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stationery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/saint_louis_university_followup_business_cards.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Identity for Saint Louis University by Olson\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/saint_louis_university_followup_folder.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Identity for Saint Louis University by Olson\" \/>\n<figcaption>Folder.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The communication materials are very straightforward but it&#8217;s all very nicely laid out and considered. A commendable approach is that all the applications are a single-color. That&#8217;s cha-ching in the bank in savings for a university. (Okay, technically, the folder is two colors, with the dark blue icons &mdash; which are also pretty nice). The brochure cover shown in the opening of the post and the notebook show how stately and elegant this identity can be while feeling contemporary.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/saint_louis_university_followup_guidelines_01.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Identity for Saint Louis University by Olson\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/saint_louis_university_followup_guidelines_02.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Identity for Saint Louis University by Olson\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/saint_louis_university_followup_guidelines_03.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Identity for Saint Louis University by Olson\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/saint_louis_university_followup_guidelines_04.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Identity for Saint Louis University by Olson\" \/>\n<figcaption>Identity guidelines.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The guidelines document looks sweeeeet.
