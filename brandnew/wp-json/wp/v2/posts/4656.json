Headquartered in Zurich, Chubb has operations in 54 countries, employing 31,000 people, and is the world&#8217;s largest publicly-traded property and casualty insurance company. With the merger, Chubb introduced a new identity designed by New York, NY- and San Francisco, CA-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wearecollins.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">COLLINS<\/a>, who also helped established the core brand message of &#8220;Craftsmanship&#8221;.<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/chubb_old_look.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Chubb by COLLINS\" \/>\n<figcaption>Samples of Chubb&#8217;s old look. Very much like what you would expect from an insurance company.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>Brian Collins, the agency&#8217;s co-Founder and Chief Creative Officer said:  &#8220;Our aim is to show that the discipline of insurance, as practiced by the new Chubb, will be vibrant and inventive. To do this, we worked with the leaders of both companies to identify their common strengths. It became evident that the most compelling value they share is their commitment to deep craftsmanship across all of their services, underwriting and execution. We&#8217;ve sought to create an evolving design language that will work in every market and across every possible articulation in a bold, confident way.&#8221;<\/blockquote><h3>COLLINS provided press release<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/chubb_logo.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Chubb by COLLINS\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo with animated field of colors.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/chubb_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Chubb by COLLINS\" \/>\n<figcaption>Bare bones logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>Collins added: &#8220;Our biggest challenge was to take two great organizations, both rich with history, and create a new, designed experience that reflects this new company &#8211; and also one that can thrive in today&#8217;s endlessly changing, dynamic world. As technology is constantly evolving and screens now make design and information instantly responsive, we chose to balance the clean simplicity of the new logo with a variety of always changing, vibrant color.&#8221;<\/blockquote><h3>COLLINS provided press release<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/chubb_logo_colors.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Chubb by COLLINS\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo on all the colors.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Both of the old logos were surprisingly &#8220;graphic&#8221;. Chubb&#8217;s odd but bold &#8220;C&#8221; icon had a Corporate Identity 101 aesthetic that made it look commanding and relatively creative. ACE gets some points for energy and daringness if not for clockwise readability. The new logo builds on Chubb&#8217;s extended wordmark to create a lovely, simple, and striking wordmark that looks precision-engineered. I guess if there was any detriment to the wordmark being so precise is that it looks like it belongs more as the logo for an engineering or aerospace company than an insurance group, which may not be the fault of the logo but the fault of our combined expectations (and prejudices) of how an insurance group should look &#8212; on the flip side it speaks positively to the notion of craftsmanship now running across Chubb. In contrast to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/new_logo_for_hatch.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">yesterday&#8217;s Hatch<\/a> this is a great example of how to expertly do a custom, extended wordmark; I criticized Hatch&#8217;s &#8220;C&#8221; yesterday and look at Chubb&#8217;s &#8220;C&#8221; &#8212; that&#8217;s hot. As are the &#8220;B&#8221;s with the relatively aggressive notches that serve both as visual ink traps when the logo is small and as a distinctive element when seen big.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/chubb_icons.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Chubb by COLLINS\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icons.

Combining the extended sans serif wordmark with Publico &#8212; a type family originally designed for newspaper editorial use &#8212; makes for a great combination that bridges the contemporary logo with a more classic aesthetic. The overall craftsmanship messaging can be hard to take without rolling your eyes as we don&#8217;t associate insurance policies with craftsmanship like we do with beer or chairs or iPhones but this identity makes the best argument possible in its favor and walks the walk after talking the talk.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in late 2015 as the result of the acquisition of The Chubb Corporation (est. 1882) by ACE Limited (est. 1985), Chubb is a global insurance leader offering both personal and commercial insurance products.
