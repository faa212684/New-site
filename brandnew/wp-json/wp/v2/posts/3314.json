The problem is that it felt like looking for love in the classifieds section of a newspaper. Kind of sad. By giving Soulmates its own logo it now has the ability to stand on its own and establish an attitude and aesthetic free from the guidelines of the news organization behind it.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not 100% clear on what the panels in the logo are meant to be; perhaps paper sheets as if they were love notes? Profile pages stacked up? It&#8217;s the only confusing part about this otherwise lovely wordmark featuring a delightful &#8220;ou&#8221; ligature that makes you want to sing &#8220;X and Y, sitting on a tree. K-I-S-S-I-N-G.&#8221; The logo and extended custom font feature some stencil breaks that I&#8217;m not sure if they were needed but certainly look nice and add some ventilation to the letterforms. The matching icons are a great way to extend the structure of the font and are probably some of the most important aspects of the identity as they become the center point of interactivity on a dating site: join, search, message.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_guardian_soulmates_09_guideline.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Guardian Soulmates by MultiAdaptor\" \/>\n<figcaption>Guideline sample pages.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_guardian_soulmates_10_application_comp.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Guardian Soulmates by MultiAdaptor\" \/>\n<figcaption>Prototype applications.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_guardian_soulmates_11_iPad-and-iPhone.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Guardian Soulmates by MultiAdaptor\" \/>\n<figcaption>Mobile web versions.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_guardian_soulmates_12_otsp-2.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Guardian Soulmates by MultiAdaptor\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_guardian_soulmates_13_otsw-2.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Guardian Soulmates by MultiAdaptor\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_guardian_soulmates_14_print-ad.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Guardian Soulmates by MultiAdaptor\" \/>\n<figcaption>Messaging and print ad.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">The identity is rounded out by fun, moody photography that, as the video reveals, has a groovy lens-flare coloring effect on top that ties all of the random images together. Amazingly, it works. You can almost feel the love chemistry at work. Compared to other well-known dating sites like Match.com, eHarmony, and OkCupid, Soulmates is remarkably advanced in its aesthetics and its sophistication makes you quite hopeful that you will, indeed, find your &#8220;urban intellectual type&#8221; better half.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Launched in 2004, Soulmates is the online dating service offered by British newspaper, The Guardian. 350,000 people have joined since and reportedly 1,500 new members join each week.
