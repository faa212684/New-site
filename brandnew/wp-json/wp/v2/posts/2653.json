Designed by Dallas, TX-based <a href=\"http:\/\/foundryco.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Foundry Co.<\/a>, the identity has a lively color palette, a delightful mascot of its own that gets turned into a great pattern, and just an overall good vibe. <a href=\"http:\/\/foundryco.com\/work\/buckley\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">The Great British Butcher by Design by Day<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_greatbritishbutcher.jpg\" alt=\"The Great British Butcher by Design by Day\"\/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">I don&#8217;t encourage flexibility for flexibility&#8217;s sake but I wish the logo for <a href=\"http:\/\/greatbritishbutcher.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Great British Butcher<\/a> by Manchester, UK-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.designbyday.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Design by Day<\/a> had a different icons within the logo, keeping the hatchet at the center.
