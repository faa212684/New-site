Based in Oslo, Norway, and Palo Alto, CA, the group&#8217;s first product will launch soon, an intelligent camera platform with collaborative capabilities. Named Huddly  Go &#8212; after a sports team&#8217;s huddle &#8212; the tiny camera can latch on to a laptop or mount on a tripod, boasts a 4.6K sensor, and is powered by machine learning and computer vision &#8212;\u00a0I&#8217;m really not sure what that means but I&#8217;m sure it beats the camera in my microwave that the government uses to spy on me. The identity for the company and its eponymous product have been designed by Oslo-based <a href=\"http:\/\/heydays.no\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Heydays<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/huddly_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Huddly by Heydays\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>I recently did a rare client logo whose name had 8 characters and I did exactly what this logo is doing here which, obviously isn&#8217;t an original idea, but there is something so infinitely satisfying about rotating letters around a circle and their centers latch on to a rounded number divided from 360\u00b0. The client didn&#8217;t pick it, but it was still one of my favorites, so I am living vicariously through this tight little unit for Huddly, where each letter is positioned in 60\u00b0 increments. Conceptually, it follows the shape of a camera lens, so it&#8217;s an easy sell. Again, far from original but the kind of simplicity you would want a client to let you get away with.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/huddly_logo_animation.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo states.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The logo can also reconfigure into multiple compositions, some more successful than others, but a nice possible metaphor for how different teams congregate.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/huddly_identity_elements.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Huddly by Heydays\" \/>\n<figcaption>Identity elements.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/huddly_business_cards.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Huddly by Heydays\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/huddly_camera_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Huddly by Heydays\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/huddly_camera.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Huddly by Heydays\" \/>\n<figcaption>Huddly itself.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/huddly_product_in_hand.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Huddly by Heydays\" \/>\n<figcaption>Camera in hand.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/huddly_packaging.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Huddly by Heydays\" \/>\n<figcaption>Packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>I love how the packaging successfully uses two version of the logo in the same place and makes it work awesomely. It&#8217;s like a Huddly sandwich. The gloss varnish effect repeats on the body of the camera itself and also looks quite lovely. The one questionable decision is the &#8220;HU [break] DDLY&#8221; on the front of the camera&#8230; something odd about the left justification all of a sudden, where everything else is centered. Still, the camera is cute enough to sustain it.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/huddly_ui_in_situ.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Huddly by Heydays\" \/>\n<figcaption>The camera and application in action.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">Unfortunately there is no demo of the UI &#8212; or not one that I could find &#8212; because its simplicity looks very intriguing and elegant (and mimics the shape of the camera). Overall, this doesn&#8217;t break any molds or pushes the envelope of what an artisanal gadget* looks like but it&#8217;s perfectly crafted and beautifully presented.<\/p>\n<p style=\"opacity:.5\">* The Kickstarter-y kind, not made by a giant corporation, on the expensive side, obsessed with details and craft, solving a very specific need or limitation from other products on the market.
