Surpassing the old child&#8217;s play logo of cut paper and mangled typography would not be hard, but this new playful logo is quite welcome. The name is pretty great and it was certainly underused in the previous version, and without being cloying or overly cute, this new logo is simple and friendly. I guess you could draw the little dog house a hundred different ways and many of them would be appropriate, but I do like the unfinished doodle they selected. And the typography isn&#8217;t bad although unlike other large corporations I think this would have benefitted from a more bubbly sans like Kodak or Xerox. But other than that, I put my paws together for this one. <strike>Apologies for the tiny logo, but it&#8217;s the only image available<\/strike> Thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.evdawg.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Evan Cancelliere<\/a> for pointing me to a bigger logo.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sbess.ca\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gray McCarty<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.globalswarming.ca\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Marko Savic<\/a> for the tip.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,26,89],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/720"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=720"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/720\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=720"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=720"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=720"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
