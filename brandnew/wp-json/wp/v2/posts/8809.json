All the illustrations are in black and offset by a simple color palette of mint and salmon colors that looks particularly great when overlaid. There is also the ornate logo that adds a delicate touch to the whole package and looks great everywhere, whether it&#8217;s on gold leaf on the window or baked in at the bottom of a coffee mug.  <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/97835945\/Persephone-Bakery-Caf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">La Terre by Pop &amp; Pac<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_laterre.jpg\" alt=\"La Terre by Pop &amp; Pac\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/chengdu-expat.com\/places\/la-terre\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">La Terre<\/a> is a high-end restaurant in Chengdu, China, serving organic, seasonal Western dishes. The identity, designed by Melbourne, Australia-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pop-pac.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pop &amp; Pac<\/a>, is described by them as being &#8220;Textured, sensory, and bold&#8221; and &#8220;inspired by raw natural elements refined to a sophisticated, layered finish&#8221;, which is exactly what I would have wanted to write so eloquently if this wasn&#8217;t the end of a long and tumultuous week. Instead, I&#8217;ll write what I can muster, which is: damn, that&#8217;s nice. To expand, though, I&#8217;m not really sure what all is going on with the gold textures, and the block of clay, and the patterns, and the weathered typography (at the link) but I&#8217;m down for this chocolate-y, forest-y, smokey-y, gold-infused concoction. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/80607039\/La-Terre\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Traktor by studio NUR<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_traktor.jpg\" alt=\"Traktor by studio NUR\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.tripadvisor.com\/Restaurant_Review-g274887-d15145500-Reviews-Traktor_Restaurant_Bar-Budapest_Central_Hungary.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Traktor<\/a> was &#8212; it looks like they closed recently as their website and social have disappeared but a Tripadvisor review was as recent as February (which I realize is a lifetime in restaurants, especially now) &#8212; a fusion restaurant in Budapest, Hungary, offering farm-to-table ingredients freshly harvested from Hungarian soil. A recent renovation of the space resulted in a clash of a multitude of textures, styles, finishes, and details that are confoundingly eclectic but, also, highly amusing because there is a tractor inside the restaurant so, really, how can you judge that? The identity, by local firm <a href=\"https:\/\/studionur.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">studio NUR<\/a> follows suit with a matching breadth of design treatments that range from the very elegant thin serif wordmark, to the playful and vibrant veggie patterns, to the slew of minimalist icons. I&#8217;m not sure these were meant to be together but they do so in a fairly convincing way and did I mention there is a tractor inside the restaurant? <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/studionur.com\/traktor\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"A trio of restaurants that you probably can&apos;t go into with beautiful design make up the selection this week, with work from Guadalajara, Melbourne, and Budapest&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,85,26],"tags":[879,574,564,1832],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8809"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=8809"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8809\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=8809"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=8809"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=8809"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
