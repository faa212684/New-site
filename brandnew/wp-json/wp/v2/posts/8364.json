Founded by and named after Max Adler, who became a philanthropist after working at Sears Roebuck &amp; Co., the Planetarium now hosts more than half a million visitors each year with the mission to &#8220;connect people to the Universe and each other&#8221;. Yesterday, Adler Planetarium introduced a new identity designed by New York, NY-based <a href=\"https:\/\/pauseforthought.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pause for Thought<\/a> and San Francisco, CA-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thechangeproject.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Change Project<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/adler_planetarium_web_digital_old.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Adler Planetarium by Pause for Thought and The Change Project\" \/>\n<figcaption>OLD website and old samples of digital banners.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The Adler Planetarium&#8217;s new logo borrowed from the sky in multiple ways. It now incorporates a warm yellow which is bright, cheerful, and optimistic, much like the Sun. &#8220;Early on in the process we established that the logo should not include the dome.&#8221; said Janice Pedley, Creative Director of Pause for Thought. &#8220;Although it&#8217;s an iconic building, the Adler&#8217;s mission is much bigger than the sky shows inside.&#8221;\u00a0The Adler reaches millions through youth STEM programs, neighborhood skywatching events, online citizen science, and other outreach projects. &#8220;We suggested this extensive programming reach could be expressed through the metaphor of an orbit of influence, with Adler at the center. The circular planet is propelled upwards with gravity assist, symbolizing how the Adler inspires people to &#8216;reach for the stars&#8217;.&#8221;<\/blockquote><h3>Pause for Thought provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/adler_planetarium_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Adler Planetarium by Pause for Thought and The Change Project\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/adler_planetarium_logo_animation.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Adler Planetarium by Pause for Thought and The Change Project\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo animation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo wasn&#8217;t too exciting or evocative but it was mostly fine and its loosely <em>spaced<\/em> &#8212; see what I did there?! &#8212; tracking could have been interpreted as elements moving away slowly from each other as if by gravity in space. The new logo drops the somber mood of the previous one with a bright, cheerful, and more space-themed approach through a monogram &#8220;A&#8221; with a planet orbiting around it. I don&#8217;t love it but I think it&#8217;s fine as a more instant expression of &#8220;Fun! Space!&#8221; that makes the museum feel more approachable. The orbit line could have been executed in a little more interesting way, perhaps with some contrasting thicks and thins and better ways of depicting depth so that it didn&#8217;t feel so flat. The wordmark on its side does annoy me. I get it that it&#8217;s like a rocket or something going up into space but it just looks silly. Other than that, the typography is mostly fine with the &#8220;A&#8221; in &#8220;Adler&#8221; echoing the shape of the monogram.<\/p>\n<blockquote>The new visual identity makes use of the Adler&#8217;s historic collection, that has been given new relevance and photography to showcase the human experience. Illustration has a part too and in fact here, the whole Adler team jumped in. &#8220;We co-created the &#8216;Adlerverse&#8217;, a collection of hand drawn stars and doodles from the staff and volunteers that feature throughout the identify system.&#8221; Adds Pedley, &#8220;With over a hundred submissions, the Adlerverse is an authentic expression of the whole organization and a celebration of the community.&#8221;<\/blockquote><h3>Pause for Thought provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/adler_planetarium_worksheet.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Adler Planetarium by Pause for Thought and The Change Project\" \/>\n<figcaption>Worksheet to create the illustrations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/adler_planetarium_visual_language_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Adler Planetarium by Pause for Thought and The Change Project\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/adler_planetarium_visual_language.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Adler Planetarium by Pause for Thought and The Change Project\" \/>\n<figcaption>Illustrations and graphics.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The identity elements are a good set of ingredients. I like how they pull historic imagery and add contemporary flourishes while also unifying them with touches of yellow. The new illustrations are charming and I really like the idea that they were created by the museum&#8217;s staff. A hand-drawn font, an element that appears in combination with both styles helps bridge them into a single universe. The introduction of a hand-drawn font seems to be good but, as I stared at the applications, I came to dislike this one, in part for its odd angles and in part for its use where each character is independently leaning back at an angle and with a very weird baseline alignment.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/adler_planetarium_folder.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Adler Planetarium by Pause for Thought and The Change Project\" \/>\n<figcaption>Folder.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/adler_planetarium_brochure_general.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Adler Planetarium by Pause for Thought and The Change Project\" \/>\n<figcaption>General brochure.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/adler_planetarium_brochure_membership.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Adler Planetarium by Pause for Thought and The Change Project\" \/>\n<figcaption>Membership brochure.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/adler_planetarium_brochure_lookup.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Adler Planetarium by Pause for Thought and The Change Project\" \/>\n<figcaption>&#8220;Look Up&#8221; guide.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The applications are fine.
