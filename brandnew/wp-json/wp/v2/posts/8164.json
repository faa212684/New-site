It was first released for Windows 10 and Xbox One in 2015, then for Android and iOS in 2017, and macOS in 2019. The market share for Edge remains low, with IE following in this trend. However, combining the market share of Edge and IE, Microsoft&#8217;s browsers are third place in PC browser market share, Chrome being first and Firefox second. Edge has no presence in the mobile phone browser market, and while a version of IE called Internet Explorer Mobile existed, it was only released on Windows 8 and Windows Phone. On Microsoft consoles, Edge replaced IE as the dominant browser a few months after its release in 2015. Market share varies by region. On some days of the week, Edge takes second place with a 10.02% share in the US on PC, whereas for the full month it has an 8.61% share, ranking third after Firefox.&#8221; (<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Microsoft_Edge\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wikipedia<\/a>)<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/microsoft_edge_2019_transition-video.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Before-to-after animation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/microsoft_edge_2019_transition-video.gif\" alt=\"New Logo for Microsoft Edge\" \/>\n<figcaption>Same but on white.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/microsoft_edge_2019_logo_beta.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Microsoft Edge\" \/>\n<figcaption>Beta app icon.
