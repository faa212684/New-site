I was on the fence about whether I should post it as a full review or not, since it&#8217;s not a very large brand and it&#8217;s neither amazing nor awful where we might all have a field day praising it or hating it. It definitely leans towards the better end of the spectrum and there is a great, simple underlying concept to the identity: the cloud icon changes on the website (and other digital applications) depending on three key activities of the service &mdash; transfers out, transfers in, and response time. The wobbly, cumulous shapes are attractive and lend for an appropriate mountainous effect that alludes to the nature of money and its fluctuation. The emerald-ish gradients work nicely in the icon and its many overlays but their abuse in the rest of the identity makes everything feel washed out and extremely repetitive. We get it: gradients, you like them.<\/p>\n<p class=\"end\">The thin typography in the logo works fine with the cloud but when you pair its light weight with an all lowercase name, the name starts to get lost and feeling unrelated to the heavy mass of color above it. Overall, it&#8217;s an improvement over the generic, previous logo that could have been for anything and it&#8217;s always worth praising when a relevant concept is built into a logo but this could have been turned up a notch with one more round of graphic refinement.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 2012, The Currency Cloud is a financial-technology company in London that handles international payment transactions with a &quot;transparent, fast, easy-to-use and secure payments engine&quot;.
