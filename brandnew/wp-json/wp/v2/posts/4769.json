The main evolution from that first explanation to the actual use was the flexibility of moving the letters around (as shown above) to be able to fit the logo into different situations, always maintaining the italicized angle that ended up influencing the materials.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\" style=\"margin-bottom:30px;\">Screen Animations<\/h1>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/173081345?loop=1&#038;color=949494&#038;title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<hr \/>\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/173075814?loop=1&#038;color=949494&#038;title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<hr \/>\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/173075815?loop=1&#038;color=949494&#038;title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<hr \/>\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/173075816?loop=1&#038;color=949494&#038;title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Screen animations while other stuff happens on stage.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Since the main attraction of the logo is that the <strong>&times;&times;&times;<\/strong>s are in constant motion we did a few different &#8220;screen savers&#8221; for segues between speakers and other announcements.

So we did: Instead of doing a regular square or rectangle program, it&#8217;s a parallelogram that echoes the angle of the logo. Then each cover has a different letter from the logo laser-cut on it; we liked the idea of inverting the layering of the <strong>&times;&times;&times;<\/strong>s with the paintings where, so far, we had put the <strong>&times;&times;&times;<\/strong>s on top of the paintings but now the laser-cutting revealed the red <strong>&times;&times;&times;<\/strong>s through red stock on the inside. There are 25 different paintings and drawings that repeat in the print run, so each one looks different. The covers were printed on Colorplan, from our sponsor <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gfsmith.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">G . F Smith<\/a>, which has a crazy range of textures (they call them embossings) and we chose a &#8220;Morocco&#8221; embossing that made the covers feel like an old canvas. (You can see the texture in the photo above.)<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\" style=\"margin-bottom:30px;\">Badges<\/h1>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/BN_Conf_EU_2016_Photos_Materials_Badges_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2016 Brand Nieuwe Conference by UnderConsideration\" \/>\n<figcaption>Badges are trimmed at the same angle as the program and logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/BN_Conf_EU_2016_Photos_Materials_Badges_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2016 Brand Nieuwe Conference by UnderConsideration\" \/>\n<figcaption>Each badge has three enamel pin crosses.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/BN_Conf_EU_2016_Photos_Materials_Badges_04.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2016 Brand Nieuwe Conference by UnderConsideration\" \/>\n<figcaption>And it&#8217;s awesome.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>For the badges we had the grand idea of doing them at the same angle as the program and logo &#8212; it&#8217;s &#8220;grand&#8221; because all these are completely hand assembled and if cutting hundreds of things at 0- and 90-degree angles is hard imagine how much harder it is to do them at an angle. The badges are mounted on black foamcore (foam board) which is usually not the fanciest of materials but in this case it proved to be just right: light weight, easy to cut, and thick. Then we printed a bunch more paintings in the same paper as the program covers and the names are printed separately on an off-white label paper. The finishing touch comes from three enamel pin <strong>&times;<\/strong>s we had custom-made. This further extended the variation in how the paintings and <strong>&times;&times;&times;<\/strong>s interact.
