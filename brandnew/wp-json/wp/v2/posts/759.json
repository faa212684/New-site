The new logo was designed by Montreal-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sidlee.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sid Lee<\/a>. The old logo was interesting in that it had that kind of cartoony, global, broadcasting feel or it could very well be the logo of one of those record stores where the sales people are all stuck up and get annoyed if you don&#8217;t know this or that band. But I digress. The new logo is certainly simpler and easier to read on screen but&hellip; why is it melting? I want to want to like it because I enjoy single-weight monograms like this one. But the <a href=\"http:\/\/new.myfonts.com\/fonts\/linotype\/itc-bauhaus\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ITC Bauhausesque<\/a> &#8220;mp&#8221; looks a little cheesy and cheap. If the idea was to join the &#8220;m&#8221; and the &#8220;p&#8221; the loop of the &#8220;p&#8221; doesn&#8217;t really connect; a lot more custom work was needed on this one, much more than adding rounded endings and elongating the stems. Nonetheless, it&#8217;s a change in the right direction, even if not properly executed.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.goodmorningstranger.com\">Nick Alexander<\/a> for the tip.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,66,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/759"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=759"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/759\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=759"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=759"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=759"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
