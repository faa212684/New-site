Their product line is divided in two &mdash; Yin-Yang oils and Brother Ignazius aromatic herb, spice, and fruit mixtures &mdash; and is sold and distributed across Europe. Recently, BON introduced a new identity designed by Graz, Austria-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.moodley.at\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Moodley Brand Identity<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/best_of_nature_old_packaging.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Best of Nature by Moodley Brand Identity\" \/>\n<figcaption>Old packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/best_of_nature_old_packaging_detail.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Best of Nature by Moodley Brand Identity\" \/>\n<figcaption>Old packaging, detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Originally, I wasn&#8217;t going to post this project based on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.moodley.at\/de\/portfolio\/branding\/best-of-nature.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the case study at Moodley&#8217;s site<\/a> but after they shared what the old packaging looked like I was convinced this made for a great before and after story.<\/p>\n<blockquote>The nature avoids unnecessary. Likewise, the new, of moodley brand identity created corporate design. The high-quality distillates and spice blends from BON now occur in a packaging which is a stand-alone face each and every product, yet leaves no doubt about their togetherness. Also available on the website after the re-branding the products at the center. And thus the purest essences of nature.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.moodley.at\/de\/portfolio\/branding\/best-of-nature.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Moodley Brand Identity project page (Google-translated)<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/best_of_nature_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Best of Nature by Moodley Brand Identity\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo was quite amateurish and very un-natural looking &mdash; nothing serene or soothing about it. The new logo keeps the essence of the original but strips away all the unnecessary decoration to keep the acronym in a diamond shape and the name spelled out underneath. It&#8217;s nothing groundbreaking and it&#8217;s far from exciting but it starts to show how the packaging is more about the product than the design.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/best_of_nature_stationery.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Best of Nature by Moodley Brand Identity\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stationery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/best_of_nature_business_cards.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Best of Nature by Moodley Brand Identity\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The stationery is airy, pretty, and simple. I don&#8217;t even want to imagine what the old one looked like.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/best_of_nature_bottles_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Best of Nature by Moodley Brand Identity\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/best_of_nature_bottles_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Best of Nature by Moodley Brand Identity\" \/>\n<figcaption>New packaging, bottles.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The biggest change here is in the small bottle packaging for the Yin-Yang oils. Scroll back up to see the original and marvel at how much wrong it packed into a tiny label, from the rain droplets to the struck-out name to the red stroke around &#8220;Yin-Yang&#8221;. The new bottles, again, are not the most amazing piece of packaging we&#8217;ve ever seen but they are highly competent and more in tune with the kind of product they contain.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/best_of_nature_packs.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Best of Nature by Moodley Brand Identity\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/best_of_nature_packs_detail.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Best of Nature by Moodley Brand Identity\" \/>\n<figcaption>New packaging, bags.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The other product, Bruder (Brother) Ignazius, comes in a clear bag with a large label and equally large serif typography for the different kinds of mixtures. Subtle changes in the color palette add some nice variety to the labels.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/best_of_nature_wrapping_paper.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Best of Nature by Moodley Brand Identity\" \/>\n<figcaption>Wrapping paper.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/best_of_nature_chocolate.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Best of Nature by Moodley Brand Identity\" \/>\n<figcaption>Bonus: Chocolate.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">Overall, this is exactly the kind of design you would expect from a product like this but it&#8217;s also so common for products like this to look like a car mechanic&#8217;s shop selling you re-bottled motor oil (not that that&#8217;s a thing but it seemed like a good analogy). Any company that chooses to improve its design presence and invest in good design gets a thumbs up from me.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Based in Frohnleiten, Austria, Best of Nature (BON) is a family-owned business that produces plant oils, spice mixtures and herbal essences &#8220;according to ancient, traditional recipes in their purest form&#8221;.
