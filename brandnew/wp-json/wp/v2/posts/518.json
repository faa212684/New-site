International media will have its lens on Beckham on and off the field, as evidenced in the care that was put into their new uniforms (navy at home and white away, with blue accents). Catchy copywriting, inspired by the logo is all too easy now, with many levels of astral-punnery to be had. The finest currently sits on the team site: &#8220;The Stars Align.&#8221; <\/p>\n<p>Founded in 1995, the name &#8220;Galaxy&#8221; refers to the parlance of LA celebrity, &#8220;stars.&#8221; The new <em>Quasar<\/em> shield supplants the team&#8217;s former <em>Cyclone<\/em> which was more or less an overhead picture of a galaxy. <\/p>\n<blockquote>&#8220;We wanted a classic and clean look that would stand the test of time, something that generations of players and fans would wear with pride on and off the field,&#8221; said Los Angeles Galaxy President and General Manager Alexi Lalas.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/la.galaxy.mlsnet.com\/news\/team_news.jsp?ymd=20070711&#038;content_id=104780&#038;vkey=pr_lag&#038;fext=.jsp&#038;team=t106\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press Release<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/la_galaxy_refer.jpg\" alt=\"Citicorp and NASA logos\" \/>\n<span class=\"small\"><strong>Identity associations.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>When I space out and stare at this logo, all I see is Dan Friedman&#8217;s old Citicorp logo (which is an abstract windmill.) But who cares, designers aren&#8217;t going to have this in their telescope, soccer fans will. The almost-NASA worm type may be a serious injury, but they can replace that next season. Implementation will be a cinch for those designers obsessed with pitch-perfect embroidery. An absence of gradients is pleasantly surprising.
