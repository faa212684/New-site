Our buying team taste around 40,000 wines each year to find just 800 that are good enough for our customers. So, 98% don&#8217;t make the cut &#8211; either for quality or for value. Our wines have been awarded over 300 medals at the major London shows this year (2013). We offer new customers a \u00a350 discount to give us a try, because we are confident about the great taste and quality of our wine.  Laithwaites is a well-established brand in America, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand that sends an exclusively selected range of small-batch wines to over 700,000 people internationally.&#8221;<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/laithwaites_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for
