Its flagship beer is the ESB (Extra Special Bitter) but it counts with a few other year-round selections, like an IPA, as well as seasonal offerings. In March Redhook introduced a completely new bottle and packaging.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/redhook_esb_evolution.jpg\" alt=\"Redhook\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Evolution of the ESB bottle and label.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/redhook_all_bottles.png\" alt=\"Redhook\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/redhook_pilsner_detail.png\" alt=\"Redhook\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/redhook_esb_detail.png\" alt=\"Redhook\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/redhook_live.jpg\" alt=\"Redhook\" \/><\/p>\n<p>I love short neck bottles with stubby bodies (like Red Stripe) and I find this new Redhook bottle extremely cool. There is a certain boldness exuded by the shape and seems to have more grab-ability, like the hand belongs along the label and in between those two small budges. The label almost looks like something you would find adhered on an old motor oil can: no frills typography, simple color coding, and one overarching graphic. The overall new packaging is bold and contemporary and a strong contrast to today&#8217;s mainstream beers who want to look more friendly and consumable.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/redhook_logo.jpg\" alt=\"Redhook\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/redhook_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"Redhook\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Although the logo didn&#8217;t change its form, its application is far better than the previous one that relied on awkward bevelation. The distressed look is perhaps a clich&eacute; for Northwest-down-to-earth brands, but it pays off here giving Redhook an appropriate &#8220;aged&#8221; look. I would have given them bonus points for actually distressing the logo (even just biting some off the edges) rather than jus applying a texture on top the sharp vector logo.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/squarespace.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tyler Thompson<\/a> for the tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_110420_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_110420_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_110420_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_110420_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,51,26],"tags":[517,53,528,526],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1433"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1433"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1433\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1433"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1433"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1433"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
