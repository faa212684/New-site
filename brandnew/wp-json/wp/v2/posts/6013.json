Ugly Drinks recently partnered with Green Park Brands (the team behind organic chickpea puff brand, <a href=\"http:\/\/hippeas.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hippeas<\/a>) as part of a newly completed funding round that will give the Ugly team the resources to develop and grow the Ugly brand, including a new logo and packaging designed by the London, UK office of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jkrglobal.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jones Knowles Ritchie<\/a> (who also designed Hippeas).<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>Ugly Drinks exists as a healthy alternative to the sugar loaded fizzy drinks category &#8211; but we believe that healthy doesn&#8217;t need to be boring. Channeling the rebellious spirit of the founders, we created a brand that points out the Ugly Truth and says the unsayable, but still leaves you with a smile on your face.

The new logo is a fantastic combination of attitude and style with the &#8220;U&#8221; of the name bringing an ugly attitude as a tongue defiantly stuck out but rendered in a super stylish, fun, market-friendly wordmark (finessed with utmost care by <a href=\"https:\/\/dribbble.com\/shots\/3916092-Ugly-Drinks-Logo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rob Clarke<\/a>). The tongue-U is also used on its own as the brand&#8217;s icon and it works surprisingly well &#8212; probably the best use of a stuck-out tongue since the Rolling Stones &#8212; floating against blue backgrounds or stuck to anthropomorphic fruits with an attitude problem.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ugly_drinks_can_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Ugly Drinks by Jones Knowles Ritchie\" \/>\n<figcaption>Can-slash-logo (plus ugly lemon-lime).<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ugly_drinks_flavor_character_01.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Ugly Drinks by Jones Knowles Ritchie\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ugly_drinks_flavor_character_02.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Ugly Drinks by Jones Knowles Ritchie\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ugly_drinks_flavor_character_03.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Ugly Drinks by Jones Knowles Ritchie\" \/>\n<figcaption>Flavor characters.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The illustration style is great, with thick, harsh strokes unifying the logo and the authority-figure-challenged pieces of fruit.

We wanted to truly define our purpose and create a brand that people would be happy to be seen with &#8211; rather than a healthy badge of honour. The new identity we created with JKR does just that, perfectly positioning us to spread the Ugly Truth on a global level.<\/blockquote><h3>Hugh Thomas, co-founder, Ugly Drinks<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ugly_drinks_new_packaging.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Ugly Drinks by Jones Knowles Ritchie\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ugly_drinks_new_packaging_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Ugly Drinks by Jones Knowles Ritchie\" \/>\n<figcaption>New packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old packaging was somewhat interesting in the texture it achieved and the large logo worked well but it felt like it was trying too hard to look ugly yet still like something fun someone would want to grab off the shelves. The new cans take advantage of their kick-ass logo and simply emblazon it large across the vibrant light blue brand color. The flavor names are the one slightly odd thing in the project, with a hard-edged speech bubble holding the names; it sort of breaks the carefree attitude with a very controlled, neatly aligned design element.
