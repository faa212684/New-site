The simplicity of the bottles with the soft rounded corners and their dash of yellow tops is a fantastic combination with the typography &#8212; a kind of twenty-first-century version of some Geigy Pharmaceuticals <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pinterest.com\/piplofts\/geigy-pharmaceuticals\/?lp=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">goodness<\/a>. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.pentagram.com\/work\/dr-jart\/story\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Park Bench Deli by Foreign Policy<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_parkbenchdeli.jpg\" alt=\"Park Bench Deli by Foreign Policy\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.parkbenchdeli.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Park Bench Deli<\/a> is a sandwich shop in Singapore offering sandwich creations from all over the world, including po&#8217; boys, tortas, banh mis, muffulettas, and pb&amp;j &#8212; all, as they say, made with swagger. Designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/foreignpolicy.design\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Foreign Policy<\/a>, the identity is as varied as the sandwich selection, sprinkling a little bit of everything unto it, from the classier stencil serif for the logo to a bold, industrial, condensed sans serif, to lo-fi illustrations, and to a color palette that&#8217;s hard to pinpoint where it starts or ends. It may not be consistent or even cohesive but it&#8217;s boisterous, fun, and matches the shop itself which is also a super weird combination of influences. If there is one takeaway, though, it&#8217;s not to feed the pigeons. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/60862181\/Park-Bench-Deli-Branding-Space\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Budynok Ihrashok (BI) by Fedoriv<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_bi.jpg\" alt=\"Budynok Ihrashok (BI) by Fedoriv\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/bi.ua\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Budynok Ihrashok (BI)<\/a> is a chain of toy stores in Ukraine with 52 retail locations and an online store.

It&#8217;s a bold look to be able to pull off but everything works pretty seamlessly and joyously. I don&#8217;t know my Cyrillic alphabet very well but the typography <em>looks<\/em> great and I love the alternate version (at the project link) where some of the characters extend into smiles.
