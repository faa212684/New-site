At 10:54 pm I decided to tune in to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.qvc.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">QVC<\/a> to see the new identity in action. First, I had to locate it in my cable line-up: QVC is sandwiched between ShopNBC (I had no clue!) and Brooklyn Community Access Television (sweet!). A lady and a man with an ear-piece were selling a jewelry box. I watched, knowing that at the turn of the hour I would get a chance to see an interstitial or <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/History_of_BBC_television_idents\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ident<\/a> showcasing the emperor&#8217;s new clothes &mdash; which, by the way, you can buy in four easy installments! My patience was rewarded with a white screen coming to life beautifully with a near-cyclic animation of the new, ribbon-like Q that shelters the perfectly classic and simple letters that form the name of the channel, which also animate nicely on screen. Then <em>Joan Rivers&#8217; Classics<\/em> started and, before I poked my eyes out, I swiveled to my computer to write this.<\/p><!--more--><p>The new identity, last updated fourteen years ago, is part of a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.qvc.com\/qic\/qvcapp.aspx\/app.html\/params.file.|cp|cp_press_092307_advertise,html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">larger advertising and marketing campaign<\/a> that support a major overhaul of the channel. One that attempts to monopolize the letter Q &mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.namedevelopment.com\/blog\/archives\/2007\/09\/qvcs_new_brandi.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">even if the U.S. Trademark database returns 1,971 results for anything filed simply under &#8220;Q&#8221;<\/a>. Their motto,  <em>iQdoU?<\/em> (I Q, do you? Just in case it took you as long to get it as it took me), takes center stage amidst a Qstatic frenzy: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2007\/09\/21\/business\/media\/21adco.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">As <em>The New York Times<\/em> reported<\/a>, there was &#8220;a house band called Q Man Group (with special guest Motley Q) [that] performed rock songs&#8221; during the unveiling at the company&#8217;s headquarters in West Chester, Pa., then there is the Qture (<em>It&#8217;s so Q. It&#8217;s so U.<\/em>) products, the QLounge, and everyone&#8217;s favorite Queer Eye, Carson Kressley, delivers the channel&#8217;s first National TV ad&#8217;s punch line <em>Merci Beau Q<\/em>. (I do have to apologize; yesterday I had seen the ad online, but now I can&#8217;t locate the link). <\/p>\n<p>All in all: Cheesy, bubbly and slightly icky in that TV shopping way. Yet, despite the unwatchable content (at least for me), the new logo surpasses any expectations I may have had about QVC. It is a delightfully simple idea &mdash; it&#8217;s a ribbon, who doesn&#8217;t like ribbons? specially when you are the one unraveling it &mdash; executed in an amazingly restrained manner &mdash; a perfect, thick circle, with a notch-and-fold at the 45-degree mark, punctuated with a simple, restrained and pertinent shadow that makes the logo feel as if it were about to peel off the screen. The simple QVC sans letters in the middle of the Q don&#8217;t add much to the logo, but as part of the requirement, they are perfectly acceptable. This is a tremendous leap for QVC, it feels modern and bold, yet in the color choices (teals, purples, pinks) it portrays a softer side, aimed at their female audience, which I would go out on a limb and wager it&#8217;s the majority. What this logo does, that I haven&#8217;t wanted to do in a long time, is it makes me want to reach and touch it, pull that loose edge and unwrap it. Hmmm, that jewelry box doesn&#8217;t look so bad at midnight.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Update 9\/30\/07:<\/strong> Unconfirmed references of who may have designed this identity have been removed as requested from interested parties.<\/strong><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,66,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/539"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=539"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/539\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=539"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=539"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=539"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
