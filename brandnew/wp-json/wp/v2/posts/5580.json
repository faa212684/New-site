While its pretty-in-pink color palette sets a soft tone, the half-blackletter, half-slab, half-upright italic &#8212; I realize that adds up to 1.5 &#8212; structure of the logo gives it a slightly edgier aesthetic. I love the starkness of the logo and how rhythmic it is. The high-end production and materials really make this feel like a luxury brand without falling into the typical tropes of fashion brands. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.dmowski.co\/#\/lui-store\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">A44 by Molto Bureau<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_a44.gif\" alt=\"A44 by Molto Bureau\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/a44.studio\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A44<\/a> is an architecture studio in Lviv, Ukraine, with a penchant for clean, straight lines and pattern repetition, just like their sweet logo designed by Kiev, Ukraine-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/moltobureau\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Molto Bureau<\/a>. This is a wonderful, dynamic logo that has been perfectly crafted. The dramatic tallness of the letters is accentuated nicely by the angle and softened with the curved joints where the crossbar meets the stems. I really dig how the logo can be used with the three characters separated or smooshed all together. The black printing on gray stock makes it solid as fu&#8230; concrete. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/51506631\/A44\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Events &amp; More by Requena<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_eventsandmore.jpg\" alt=\"Events &amp; More by Requena\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.eventsandmore.es\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Events &amp; More<\/a> is an event planning company with offices in Barcelona and Madrid, Spain, led by owner Maria <strong>More<\/strong>so (emphasis mine and to highlight where the name comes from). The cleverness extends to the logo, designed by Barcelona-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.andresrequena.es\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Requena<\/a>, that is a stylized &sum; (summation sign for, you know, &#8220;more&#8221;), an &#8220;E&#8221;, and a sideways &#8220;M&#8221;. It&#8217;s a simple and striking logo that is used to great effect in the applications, changing from huge to small but always keeping the same stroke thickness. The single coral red color gives it an extra boost of vibrancy, while the typography keeps it classy. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/35301579\/Events-More\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"A bevy of hard angles this week, with work from Warsaw, Kiev, and Barcelona&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[58,68,11,76,26],"tags":[785,953,540,369],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5580"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=5580"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5580\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=5580"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=5580"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=5580"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
