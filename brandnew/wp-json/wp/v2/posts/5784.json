The identity by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hannahdesign.co.nz\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">HANNAH Design Studio<\/a> features a slender, vertically-stacked wordmark that is a rare case of a beautiful and elegant vertically-stacked wordmark; the combination of letters and shortness of the name works perfectly. Without any additional doodads or elements, the identity basically revolves around the strength of the logo and some fantastic paper stock choices in a muted color palette.  <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hannahdesign.co.nz\/project\/hugos-bistro\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Rapport by Jaeho Shin<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_rapport.jpg\" alt=\"Rapport by Jaeho Shin\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">Rapport is a clothing import company in South Korea&#8230;\u00a0I was not able to confirm its existence as the URL listed on the project images doesn&#8217;t work and there is no social media or even Yelp reviews but it seems legit and, heck, it&#8217;s nice. Designed by Seoul-based <a href=\"http:\/\/cargocollective.com\/jaemon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jaeho Shin<\/a>, the identity (almost literally) revolves around a lovely &#8220;R&#8221; monogram that looks like a thread from a piece of clothing being tied into a knot. The monogram has a nice curvature and flow to it and is presented in the right thickness. The wordmark is a good complement with its big open counters and short ascenders. What makes this stand out is, like Hugo&#8217;s above, the colored stock selection in a surprisingly attractive combination of poop brown, salmon, muted blue, and off-white. The letterheads (or folders) with the big &#8220;R&#8221; are on fire. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/cargocollective.com\/jaemon\/Rapport\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Carpos by Panos Tsakiris<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_carpos.jpg\" alt=\"Carpos by Panos Tsakiris\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.carpos.ch\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Carpos<\/a>, in Gossau, Switzerland, is a producer of extra virgin olive oil, which explains the preponderance of olive-colored paper selected by London, UK-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/tsaktoppan7629\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Panos Tsakiris<\/a>.
