In November of last year, Centric introduced a new identity and on-air look designed by New York, NY-based <a href=\"http:\/\/gretelny.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gretel<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>The goal from the start was to create a brand with modernity, style and attitude. Our solution was to create a densely layered brand. One that felt expressive, but thoroughly modern.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/gretelny.com\/project\/50\/centric-branding\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gretel project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/centric_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and On-air Look for Centric by Gretel\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/centric_logo_detail_wordmark.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and On-air Look for Centric by Gretel\" \/>\n<figcaption>Wordmark detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The new logo is the heart of this brand. It embodies complexity and variation in both its form and fill. The logo is ever changing, it can take on a range of styles and reflect an array of personalities.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/gretelny.com\/project\/50\/centric-branding\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gretel project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/centric_logo_animations.gif\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and On-air Look for Centric by Gretel\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo animations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The previous logo was very <em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=soul+train&#038;es_sm=91&#038;source=lnms&#038;tbm=isch&#038;sa=X&#038;ei=oT3bVP_dIcu-ggTqv4DQAw&#038;ved=0CAkQ_AUoAg&#038;biw=1363&#038;bih=866\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Soul Train<\/a><\/em>-ish which, given the channel&#8217;s musical provenance, made sense but visually it was a little drab. The new logo kicks off the dance party that&#8217;s about to happen in your eyes with a patchwork &#8220;C&#8221; and standalone wordmark full of textures, working surprisingly well in single color and, obviously, exploding in full color. I can&#8217;t pinpoint what it is that makes this so appropriate for the audience but I do know it wouldn&#8217;t work for a channel for white men. The colors and textures have a bold energy and the logo (or the rest of the work below) never fall into typical visual cues of channels targeted at women.<\/p>\n<blockquote>Because our goal was to create an expressive brand, we knew we couldn&#8217;t rely on a modular system without considerable range. We needed an extensive library of elements that, when layered upon one another, offer eclectic variation. While the creative combinations are endless, they result from a consistent formula: Photo + Color + Texture + Pattern + Type. By mixing, remixing and changing the proportions of our brand ingredients, we can always come up with new and exciting results without deviating from the brand.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/gretelny.com\/project\/50\/centric-branding\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gretel project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/centric_logo_ingredients.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and On-air Look for Centric by Gretel\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/centric_logo_ingredients_animated.gif\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and On-air Look for Centric by Gretel\" \/>\n<figcaption>Identity ingredients.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/centric_logo_ingredients_patterns_textures.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and On-air Look for Centric by Gretel\" \/>\n<figcaption>Patterns and textures.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/centric_type.gif\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and On-air Look for Centric by Gretel\" \/>\n<figcaption>Typographic system.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/116114435?color=ffffff&#038;title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>On-air look montage.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The on-air look is unapologetically complex and dense and the only modus operandi it works on is overdrive. And it&#8217;s downright awesome. The multiple layering, pacing, colors, and motion behaviors are extreme and fast-paced. Perhaps for some it might just be too much &mdash; and it would be a very justifiable opinion &mdash; but to me this is really fantastic, a respite from the flat minimalist approach of most on-air looks recently. (Which I also like and appreciate, but this visually gluttonous approach shows that sometimes more is more interesting). I highly recommend seeing the project page on Gretel&#8217;s website as it breaks down all the on-air ingredients and has more images and animated GIFs than I can accommodate here.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/116921110?color=ffffff&#038;title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Ident: &#8220;Quote&#8221;.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/116915334?color=ffffff&#038;title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Ident: &#8220;Designed For&#8221;.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/centric_business_cards.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and On-air Look for Centric by Gretel\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/centric_taxi_ad.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and On-air Look for Centric by Gretel\" \/>\n<figcaption>Taxi top ad.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/centric_posters.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and On-air Look for Centric by Gretel\" \/>\n<figcaption>Posters.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/centric_music.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and On-air Look for Centric by Gretel\" \/>\n<figcaption>Cool thing that says MUSIC.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">In print, the identity is able to translate the restrained frenetic energy of the motion pieces with heavily layered layouts and ever-changing logos that convey its dynamic nature. It also looks as if everything is set up using C, M, Y, and K, making it easy to overlay and\/or separate colors and get fully vibrant hues every time. Overall, this is one of my favorite TV branding projects in some time. It&#8217;s very ambitious in its foundation &mdash; from photographing models to capturing textures and patterns in motion &mdash; while the result is visually gratifying and very much a distinct proposition for the audience. This is definitely no Lifetime or even Oxygen.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"First aired in 1996 as BET Jazz &mdash; a spin-off of the popular Black Entertainment Television (BET) channel focusing on jazz and later on general music &mdash; Centric, as it was renamed in 2009 while shifting its content to a&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,66,26],"tags":[625,751,290,769,335,429],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3771"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3771"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3771\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3771"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3771"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3771"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
