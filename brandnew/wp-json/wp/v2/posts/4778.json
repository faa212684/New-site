The result is a simple and elegant logo but with a very distinct visual edge that comes from the irregular-shaped &#8220;1&#8221;s. This is one of the rare cases where the underlying grid is a pleasure to see as it reveals the tight construction and design reasoning behind the logo. There is not much in application but that&#8217;s not a problem as the strength of this project is the logo alone, which is a cut above the rest. (Get it? Salon? &#8220;Cut&#8221;? Yeah, I know, know). <a href=\"http:\/\/inhousedesign.co.nz\/project\/m11-studio\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a> <span class=\"gray_70\">(Via<\/span> <a href=\"http:\/\/bpando.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BP&amp;O<\/a><span class=\"gray_70\">)<\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Dieresis by Comit\u00e9 Central<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_dieresis.jpg\" alt=\"Dieresis by Comit\u00e9 Central\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/dieresis.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dieresis<\/a> &#8212; Umlaut in English, as in \u00fc &#8212; is an art gallery in Guadalajara, Mexico, that chose the diacritical mark as its name for the change it gives an existing sound, much like art provides a different view on ordinary things. The logo, designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/comitecentral.mx\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Comit\u00e9 Central<\/a> is literally an umlaut, two dots. On their own they pay off nicely on the name but in application they extend the concept quite beautifully by die-cutting the umlaut in the print materials that act as windows to see beyond what&#8217;s directly in front of you, as they explain it, and as I buy it. The deadpan design approach serves the applications well and gives the gallery a confident air of authority. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/21297665\/Diresis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Hedeker by Socio Design<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_hedeker.jpg\" alt=\"Hedeker by Socio Design\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/hedekerwealth.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hedeker<\/a>, based in Lincolnshire, IL, offers wealth management, financial planning, and tax services to individuals, families, and foundations.

Good for them, because it&#8217;s gorgeous. The wordmark is a little dry and the icon is nice and ambiguous but the applications are beautifully done in a rich, luxurious palette of dark blue, brown, and copper that looks exclusive and luxurious but not pretentious. The typography all around is impeccable and the bonus dot pattern is, well, a great bonus. <a href=\"http:\/\/sociodesign.co.uk\/hedeker\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Plenty of minimal, smart, and expertly produced designs today with work from Auckland, Guadalajara, and London&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[1286,1029,1287],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4778"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4778"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4778\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4778"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4778"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4778"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
