Even though this operates within the trend of private label design to be white backgrounds with bright colors and minimal product photography, this excels at it. The red color is so strong and energetic and I love how the &#8220;AL&#8221; logo is often cropped. As a reminder from Friday Likes 55, &#8220;Al&#8221; translates as &#8220;Buy&#8221; or &#8220;Take&#8221;, so pretty much every package is a call to action. I&#8217;ll buy some beans, yes, and take some, um, pumpkin juice, please. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/52113255\/Al-Market-private-label\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Foxy by Le Billyclub<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_foxy.jpg\" alt=\"Foxy by Le Billyclub\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/foxy.restaurant\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Foxy<\/a> is a restaurant in Montr\u00e9al, Quebec, from the same owners of Olive et Gourmando, a renowned foodie destination. Designed by a local group of designers banded under the name <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lebillyclub.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Le Billyclub<\/a>, the restaurant&#8217;s design is a restrained medley of elements that include a lovely thick-line abstraction of a fox, an extra wide script wordmark, a pizza-slice variation, and some charming fox illustrations. If the circle fox icon were a little thinner it would be even better but I still like how it looks in application, giving the overall rustic vibe of the place a contemporary garnish. The real treat, though, is the script wordmark that has a lovely flow to it.  <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/34940931\/Foxy-Brand-identity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Reinhartsen by Op design studio<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_reinhartsen.jpg\" alt=\"Reinhartsen by Op design studio\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.reinhartsen.no\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Reinhartsen<\/a> is a seafood haven in the island of Flekker\u00f8ya in Norway, where they catch, prepare, and sell (as retail or restaurant) all kinds of deliciousness. Designed by Kristiansand, Norway-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.opdesign.no\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Op design studio<\/a>, the logo is a great, modern interpretation of the company&#8217;s old one &#8212; you can see it at the project link &#8212; that takes the same elements of fish, crown, and script lettering to form a great-looking seal with a fish-crown and a wonderful wordmark that feels like it&#8217;s been like that for decades. While there are fancy applications of the logo in signage and liveries, my favorite is how well it looks on the styrofoam that keeps the fish cold or on the air-sealed bags. There is something very utilitarian about it but still very elegant, like a refined gentleman or lady that doesn&#8217;t break a sweat when dressed to the nines in ninety-degree weather. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.opdesign.no\/work\/reinhartsen\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Plenty of elements to whet your appetite &#8212; for food and\/or typography &#8212; with projects from Moscow, Montr\u00e9al, and Kristiansand&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[69,11,85,26],"tags":[663,309,564,54],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5644"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=5644"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5644\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=5644"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=5644"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=5644"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
