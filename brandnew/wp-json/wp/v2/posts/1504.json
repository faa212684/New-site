While they have a small presence in the U.S. they are very well known in Europe. Mango currently operates over 2,000 stores in 105 countries and counts with more than 8,000 employees. I remember there being a store in Mexico City and it used to be geared towards a younger demographic but it seems like they have upped the age range and have introduced a new logo that is aimed at a more mature audience. The new logo was designed in-house.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>This new logo represents the values of the brand, such as its unique style, originality and femininity, and is adapted to the style of the MANGO woman of today. In order for it to endure over time and not suffer changes in fashion, MANGO has taken the most illustrative aspects of the former logo, based on mecano parts and in which the &#8216;o&#8217;, for example, was similar to a screw head, taking as a reference a simple, discreet and solid type face.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/arabnews.com\/economy\/corporatenews\/article442343.ece\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Arab News<\/a> (I think this may be a press release)<\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mango_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"Mango Logo, Before and After\" \/><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s funny how a stencil serif wordmark can be used for both a quirky European fashion brand that can employ Kate Moss as well as for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.homedepot.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a home improvement store<\/a> that would never see Kate Moss &mdash; or anyone that looks like Kate Moss &mdash; in its stores. The previous logo was okay, it benefits from 25 years of equity as well as its association to European fashion but it&#8217;s really nothing special. The new one isn&#8217;t either but at least it&#8217;s a clear evolution from the old one providing a very simple and easy segue into the next however-many-years they go with the new logo. The stencil marks in the new logo are clearer and play much better with the extended letterforms, whereas the old looked squished. The &#8220;O&#8221; is a little weird, with only one notch, making it look like a bull nose ring. Overall, it&#8217;s an expected evolution or, in other words, they didn&#8217;t screw it up too much.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to Marc Permanyer for the tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_110617_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_110617_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"574\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,86,26],"tags":[580,42,437],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1504"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1504"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1504\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1504"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1504"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1504"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
