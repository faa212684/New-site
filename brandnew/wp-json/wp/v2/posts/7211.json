And unlike other dating apps, our smart algorithm curates only quality matches, so singles can spend less time swiping. Community members can get to know their matches with our in-depth profiles, and then use our Icebreakers to start a meaningful chat (bagel stickers, included). They can also access special features like Activity Reports and Read Receipts, which help members focus on active matches who matter most. But underneath our pioneering features, handsome app, and bagel puns, we&#8217;re aiming for a greater goal: to get to the heart of meaningful connections. And because we continue to refine with that original goal in mind, Coffee Meets Bagel has made more than 50,000,000 matches and thousands of lasting relationships globally.&#8221;<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/coffee_meets_bagel_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Coffee Meets Bagel by Lobster Phone\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/coffee_meets_bagel_app_icon_before_after.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Coffee Meets Bagel by Lobster Phone\" \/>\n<figcaption>App icon, before and after.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/coffee_meets_bagel_icon_app_phone.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Coffee Meets Bagel by Lobster Phone\" \/>\n<figcaption>App icon.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/coffee_meets_bagel_app.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Coffee Meets Bagel by Lobster Phone\" \/>\n<figcaption>App screens.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/coffee_meets_bagel_social_media_posts.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Coffee Meets Bagel by Lobster Phone\" \/>\n<figcaption>Social media posts.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/coffee_meets_bagel_layouts.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Coffee Meets Bagel by Lobster Phone\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sample layouts.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/coffee_meets_bagel_pattern.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Coffee Meets Bagel by Lobster Phone\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brand pattern.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/coffee_meets_bagel_swag.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Coffee Meets Bagel by Lobster Phone\" \/>\n<figcaption>Swag.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"(Est. 2012) &quot;Coffee Meets Bagel (CMB) is a dating app that connects community members with people who inspire them, who spark their heart.
