Originally designed <a href=\"http:\/\/www.landor.com\/index.cfm?do=ourwork.casehistory&#038;cn=5308\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">by Landor in 2003<\/a>, the new identity has been designed <a href=\"http:\/\/www.futurebrand.com\/news\/press-releases\/futurebrand-rebrands-batelco\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">by Futurebrand<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>Our logo symbolises this bold direction by evoking the idea of what you can &#8220;be&#8221; with Batelco. Our new identity celebrates Batelco as a Bahraini icon, linking us in colour and with the letter B to our country. The bilingual logo, which reads as both an English and Arabic letter B, also resembles an infinity sign, further communicating Batelco&#8217;s omnipresence throughout Bahrain.<br \/>&mdash; Futurebrand Project Description<\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/batelco_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"Batelco\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">English and Arabic (read right to left) versions of the logo.<\/p>\n<p>The previous logo was remarkably dull and generic &mdash; but given that Batelco is owned by three Government agencies, it somehow seemed appropriate &mdash; and would have been impossible to convert into an exciting consumer brand. The new logo, in contrast, is remarkably strong and memorable. The &#8220;B&#8221; icon is simple and elegant and looks great big or small (perhaps it&#8217;s a little too big in the lock-up, but that&#8217;s a minor complaint). The infinity concept is good even if the execution strays a little from what we would all recognize as an infinity symbol, but the effort in making the icon look like a Latin <em>and<\/em> Arabic &#8220;B&#8221; (it&#8217;s just the lower u-shaped part with the dot) is really nice. The wordmark verges on appropriate and weird, with the &#8220;e&#8221; and &#8220;c&#8221; standing out like sore, square thumbs against the other characters which have curved corners&hellip; I guess it could be worse. The applications, from web site to signage, feel stylish and trendy without going overboard. A pretty great update, even by infinity standards.\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/batelco_launch_event_02.jpg\" alt=\"Batelco\" \/>\n<p class=\"caption\">Launch event of new brand.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/batelco_signage_01.jpg\" alt=\"Batelco\" \/>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/batelco_signage_02.jpg\" alt=\"Batelco\" \/>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/batelco_store_signage_02.jpg\" alt=\"Batelco\" \/>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yotamhadar.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Yotam Hadar<\/a> for first tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_100105_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_100105_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"574\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,26,89],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1000"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1000"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1000\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1000"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1000"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1000"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
