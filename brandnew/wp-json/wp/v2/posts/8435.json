The AI-based app provides impartial advice and recommends the financial products one needs, from savings accounts to pensions, insurance to investments, and more, based on each person&#8217;s finances. Toward the end of last year, Multiply introduced a new identity designed by London, UK-based <a href=\"https:\/\/raggededge.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ragged Edge<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>Rabbits. Multiply. When you see it, you get it. The visual identity is all about that confidence. And the tongue-in-cheek tone of voice demands to be heard. In a category of look-a-likes and sound-a-likes, it all comes together in a stupidly simple but surprisingly deep brand. A brand that can both educate and motivate.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/raggededge.com\/work\/multiply-branding\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ragged Edge project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/multiply_logo_a.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Multiply by Ragged Edge\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/multiply_logo_with_bunnies.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo with rabbits.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo (sorry for the small, blurry image) was decent in terms of execution and type choice but the multiply symbol replacing the tittle of the &#8220;i&#8221; made it look like you got an answer wrong and it was x&#8217;d out, which is not something you want in financial planning. The new logo, at first glance, is a charming, friendly, bubbly, wordmark that looks fun and inviting &#8212; the opposite of what one might think about when thinking about financial planning. At second glance, once you&#8217;ve seen the rabbits, the initial &#8220;M&#8221; of the logo reveals a pair of rabbit ears in the negative space and then it becomes even better. The wordmark (and the identity) uses Sharp Type&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/sharptype.co\/typefaces\/Doyle\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Doyle Black Italic<\/a>, which is a contemporary take on my personal favorite, Cooper Black, which is a typeface so prevalent that I think it engenders a lot of familiarity, making a finance AI app a little less scary and cold.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/multiply_tagline_lots_of_bunnies.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Multiply by Ragged Edge\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/multiply_messaging_01.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Multiply by Ragged Edge\" \/>\n<figcaption>Messaging with and without rabbits.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/multiply_bunnies_animation_holes.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<hr \/>\n<div class=\"video-container\" style=\"background:#101010\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/multiply_bunnies_animation_dryer.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Rabbits<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The rabbits are fantastic both in concept and execution.
