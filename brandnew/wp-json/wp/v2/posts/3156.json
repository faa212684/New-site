Created by tech entrepreneurs (and millionaires) Xochi and Michael Birch, who sold their company, Bebo, to AOL for $850 million in 2008, the club features five bars, a restaurant (called 717B), a 3,000 bottle wine cellar, a library, a game room, fourteen luxury hotel suites, a gym, a spa, and a 20-person hot tub. It has its own art program with a curator. Membership costs $2,400 and you must be nominated by an existing member and pass a committee review. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2014\/01\/12\/fashion\/San-Francisco-club-Battery-Michael-Birch-Xochi-Birch.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The <em>New York Times<\/em> has more<\/a> on the extravagances that the steep price affords you and the kind of crowd you can expect &mdash; &#8220;You can&#8217;t just have tech people because those conversations get boring.&#8221; While the interiors were designed by exuberant event designer and interior decorator, <a href=\"http:\/\/kenfulk.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ken Fulk<\/a> (who is also reported as the club&#8217;s Creative Director), the identity and materials for the whole experience have been designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mm-sf.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MM<\/a>.

They directed all photography and created the way-finding signage. Furthermore, MM wrote and created The Battery Customs handbook and <em>Musto Times<\/em> newspaper, and will continue to be the stewards of the brand moving forward with new ideas to help tell the narrative through various media.<\/blockquote><h3>Provided text<\/h3>\n<p>There is no denying or questioning the opulence of the place. My guess is most of you are as irritated as I am by the pretentiousness of it &mdash; which further entrenches the perception of the tech crowd as out-of-touch, rich windbags. (Apologies to the 1% of our readership who might fall under this classification). But once you are able to accept the fact that this place exists, is real, and that people in there actually say things like &#8220;I have my finger on the pulse,&#8221; then you will be able to appreciate what a stunning identity and amazingly produced range of materials have been created for it.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_battery_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for The Battery by MM\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_battery_icon_set.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for The Battery by MM\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icon set.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_battery_sign.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for The Battery by MM\" \/>\n<figcaption>Outdoor sign.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The logo has a great secret society-meets-luxury-fashion-brand aesthetic to it with its exaggerated serifs and stencil approach.
