Over 167,000 employees work at its 700-plus offices in more than 140 countries.

Mostly boring and no additional visuals other than a lukewarm animation of the new logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>You know&hellip; I had never really paid attention to the old Ernst &amp; Young logo. From memory I would have remembered it had a tilted, square icon of some sort but I hadn&#8217;t realized it was a minimal, interlocked &#8220;E&#8221; and &#8220;Y&#8221;. So very nice. The accompanying type wasn&#8217;t too terrible and it clearly stated the company&#8217;s seriousness. The new logo maintains the interlocking &#8220;E&#8221; and &#8220;Y&#8221; approach but in the least unimaginative, unexciting, uncontrollably dull way possible. Perhaps they were aiming for sophisticated, bold simplicity but they missed that target by miles. The new logo also makes more clear use of the &#8220;Beam&#8221; graphic that has already been used by the company for some time (see top image) but it does nothing in favor of the monogram &mdash; if anything, it makes the logo look more like a trucking company or the parent company of Budget car rental.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ey_lobby_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Name for Ernst &amp; Young by BrandPie\" \/>\n<figcaption>This image and all below taken at EY&#8217;s London office.

Overall, a boring logo, executed without any flavor that does little in building a better working world.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1989 with the merger of Ernst &amp; Whinney (previously Ernst &amp; Ernst, est. 1903) and Arthur Young (est. 1906), Ernst &amp; Young is one of the leading global providers of assurance, tax, transactions, and advisory services and are&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,36,26],"tags":[783,40,42],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2559"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2559"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2559\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2559"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2559"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2559"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
