The packaging, designed by Oslo, Norway-based <a href=\"https:\/\/olssonbarbieri.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Olss\u00f8n Barbieri<\/a>, has a lovingly typeset label on the front &#8212; inspired by taxonomical documents &#8212; with a lot of great typographic details. This is contrasted by a stunning 7-color, silkscreen-printed, pointillism illustration of acorns, butterflies, and green leaves that looks great against the golden hue of the aquavit. Di-still my beating heart. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/olssonbarbieri.com\/gullmunn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Baozi by behalf studio<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_baozi.jpg\" alt=\"Baozi by behalf studio\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/baozihcm\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Baozi<\/a> is a small chain of fast-food restaurants in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, offering bao and other &#8220;label-less selection of Asian fusion food&#8221;. The identity, designed by local firm <a href=\"https:\/\/onbehalfof.studio\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">behalf studio<\/a>, is self-described as &#8220;Banksy got drunk in Chinatown&#8221;, which should be a design category all its own like Brutalism or Minimalism because this is so much raging fun&#8230;\u00a0and chaotic. Fueled by a series of dark (as in their content, not their hue and brightness) illustrations that reference about a dozen different things each, from culture to art, the identity calms down a little in most of the applications by adorning all of its take-out materials with knock-off and parody versions of well-known logos (like Hot Wheels) or objects (like Campbell&#8217;s Soup). Amidst all of this, the logo is pretty great and looks awesome in the uniforms. There is not much rhyme or reason to all of it together but that&#8217;s what happens when Banksy gets drunk in Chinatown so it&#8217;s best to just accept it. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/94662027\/Baozi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Air Co. by Mythology and Joe Doucet<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_airco.jpg\" alt=\"Air Co. by Mythology and Joe Doucet\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/aircompany.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Air Co.<\/a> is Brooklyn, NY-based innovation and social-good-minded company that makes products by extracting carbon dioxide from the air &#8212; their carbon converting system has received awards from NASA and the United Nations. Its first product is a vodka that uses only two ingredients, air and water, as opposed to the usual fermented grains such as corn, potato, or wheat. Billed as &#8220;the world&#8217;s purest, most sustainable vodka&#8221;, the packaging needed to match the claim. Designed by New York-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mythology.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mythology<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/joedoucet.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Joe Doucet<\/a>, the bottle certainly oozes purity, with a slick and sturdy silhouette, anchored by a bare-minimum label &#8212; adhered, btw, with a custom natural, non-toxic adhesive &#8212; at the bottom, allowing the crystal-clearness of the product to shine through. The label&#8217;s most exuberant element is a very elegant, thin sans serif type treatment for &#8220;Air Co&#8221; that is sumptuously embossed. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, it&#8217;s all a little on the pretentious side but it&#8217;s unquestionably nice and at $65 a bottle, it better be. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/joedoucet.com\/index#\/airco\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Two distillery products serve as elegant bookends for some crazy funkiness this week, with work from Oslo, Ho Chi Minh City, and New York&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[51,11,85,26],"tags":[481,564,1465,886,929],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8743"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=8743"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8743\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=8743"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=8743"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=8743"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
