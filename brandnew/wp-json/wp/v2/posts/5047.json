Paired with the chunky <a href=\"https:\/\/www.myfonts.com\/fonts\/itc\/clearface\/?refby=ucllc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ITC Clearface<\/a>, the pig pimps with equal delight desserts, beer, weekly dishes, and vegetables. The thick line drawings go great with the font and the single color approach gives it a vernacular aesthetic. The pig is accompanied by a wide range of other subjects, like chickens and fish, that add festiveness to the menu and welcome guests on a hand-drawn mural on the inside of the doors that swing open into the street.

I would say that description is extremely accurate as all the monograms and ornaments are beautiful but why they are shaped like keys or why there is a creepy bird is a mystery. Slight joking aside, this does have the flair of some kind of sexy magic potion brand if <em>Harry Potter<\/em> and <em>Fifty Shades of Grey<\/em> had a sophisticated baby. The dark green and copper color palette is rich and mysterious while the overall typography is elegant and upscale. Completely random way of closing this paragraph: I feel like the bird is giving me the <em>stink<\/em> eye. Get it? Stink?

In general, stroke typography is hard to make look good but here, thanks to the  large surface of Akzidenz Grotesk Bold Extended, there is enough room to let those strokes clearly define each letter and not get all filled in and smushed. The combination of fill and stroke type works great in the copy-heavy posters. Even on its own, as in the stationery, the logo has an old-world bluntness that looks as it belongs in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lettersofnote.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Letters of Note<\/a>. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pentagram.com\/#\/blog\/135056\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Fun, mysterious, and serious&#8230; it&apos;s all here, with work from Barcelona, Minneapolis, and London&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[134,1328,564,427,806],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5047"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=5047"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5047\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=5047"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=5047"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=5047"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
