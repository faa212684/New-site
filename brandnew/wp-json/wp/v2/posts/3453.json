(Hopefully not to sound too uncultured: first time I hear of this land). The duties were won by Baku back in 2012 when 49 National Olympic Committees voted its approval &mdash; it was the only bidding city. Approximately 6,000 athletes from 49 countries will compete in 19 sports. In November of 2013, the Baku organizing committee introduced the event&#8217;s logo, designed by Ankara, Turkey-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/pub\/adam-yunisov\/18\/407\/3ab\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Adam Yunisov<\/a>, and at the end of August it unveiled the Look of the Games, designed by London-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.someoneinlondon.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SomeOne<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><p>The multiple elements of the logo and their meanings are explained in detail in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.baku2015.com\/en\/news\/press-releases\/23-11-2013\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this press release<\/a>.

As a graphic device, though, it lacks sophistication and has far too many swooshy flares no two of which seem to be visually related&hellip; I think I am being far too forgiving: looking closely at the icon, it&#8217;s a real mess. Luckily, it seems SomeOne was given permission to clean up some of the shapes &mdash; see detail directly below &mdash; with the benevolent flying creature benefitting the most. (It would be the least productive use of both your and my time to even get into the cons of the original logo&#8217;s typography).<\/p>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/baku_2015_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Look of the Games for Baku 2015 by SomeOne\" \/>\n<figcaption>Refined logo and typography.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>Central to the new brand is the pomegranate tree, which symbolises unity in Azerbaijani folklore.

It will be interesting to see how it translates in real life, though, as I&#8217;m guessing the ultimate application and execution will fall to the in-house design team of the organizing committee. But for an inaugural edition, Baku has already established a strong design precedent that hopefully will carry on for future editions every four years.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Taking place for the first time in 2015 from June 12 to June 28, the inaugural European Games will be hosted by Baku, the capital city of the Republic of Azerbaijan.
