Designed by New York, NY-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pentagram.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pentagram<\/a> partner Michael Bierut, the logo is typeset in one of his signature specialty fonts, Franklin Gothic, and presented in a heavily matter-of-fact way that gives it that lo-fi deli charisma. The simplicity of the logo works great for repetition in a number of ways, as seen on the take-out bags and the tray liner. The project&#8217;s most attractive asset, though, is the photography by <a href=\" target=\"_blank\">Bobby Doherty<\/a> that makes the sandwiches look like a hyperrealistic painting and serves as the perfect backdrop for the logo and onslaught of Franklin Gothic. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pentagram.com\/#\/blog\/135538\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a> <\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Brinkmeier &amp; Partner by NOBLENORSE<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_brinkmeier.gif\" alt=\"Brinkmeier &amp; Partner by NOBLENORSE\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/brinkmeier-partner.de\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brinkmeier &amp; Partner<\/a> is a law firm in Hamburg, Germany, that specializes in labor law and lays down its own law with an \u00fcber minimalist identity designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.noblenorse.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> NOBLENORSE<\/a>. I&#8217;m usually on the fence about projects like this &#8212; sometimes this amount of simplicity just comes across as laziness or pretentiousness &#8212; but there is a great balance achieved here in the unusual lock-up of the name and the resulting B &amp; P monogram that then becomes the key element in application; blink and you will miss it embossed on the business cards and envelopes. The orange, black, and white color palette works great with the minimalist typography. One last detail worth mentioning is the  alignment in the letterhead of the full name on the front and the monogram in the back.

Designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.leoburnettdesign.ca\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Leo Burnett Design<\/a>, the design department of Leo Burnett Canada, the logo is as chunky as some of the products offered, with a very simple wordmark where the &#8220;Q&#8221; is the key element with its tail appended in the same thickness as the &#8220;I&#8221;. The simple wordmark pairs great with the muted photography to convey that these are quality products but not overly fuzzy (although tell that to your neck as it&#8217;s wrapped in alpaca goodness). <a href=\"http:\/\/www.leoburnettdesign.ca\/#\/qoni\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"A healthy range of minimal identities this week, with work from New York, Hamburg, and Toronto&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[580,967,564],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5141"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=5141"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5141\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=5141"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=5141"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=5141"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
