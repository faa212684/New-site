(The official range of their offerings is &#8220;skip-the-line tickets to the world&#8217;s most iconic attractions, walking tours by top local experts, immersive food and beverage tours, cooking and craft classes, bucket-list experiences and niche offerings you won&#8217;t find anywhere else&#8221;.) Based in Berlin, Germany, and with offices in 14 other countries, the company employs over 400 travel experts that curate the selections on the site which have yielded 15 million bookings since its inception. Most active in Europe, GetYourGuide is looking to expand its presence across the U.S. and Asia. Earlier this month, GetYourGuide introduced a new identity designed by <a href=\"https:\/\/design.studio\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DesignStudio<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>GetYourGuide goes much further than A to B; joining people to places, ideas to itineraries, moments with even better moments. To celebrate these journeys, and communicate connected experiences, we created five different lines inspired by all the ways we travel. These lines connect to copy and imagery to explain different journeys in a simple, light-hearted way.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/design.studio\/work\/getyourguide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DesignStudio project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/get_your_guide_squiggles_meaning_a.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for GetYourGuide by DesignStudio\" \/>\n<figcaption>Lines.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The playful lines twist and turn, forming the GetYourGuide wordmark. It represents the different activities GetYourGuide provides, and how much fun people can have. The wordmark captures the spirit of these diverse journeys. From the directional arrow we&#8217;ve hidden in the G&#8217;s, to the graphic language that&#8217;s embedded in our letterforms. The logo reflects how people holiday, whether it&#8217;s going with the flow or being super organised. There are multiple versions so that it fits every format and size &#8211; from giant billboards, to a tiny mobile icon.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/design.studio\/work\/getyourguide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DesignStudio project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\" style=\"padding-bottom:65%\"><video controls controlsList=\"nodownload\" autoplay loop muted playsinline><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/get_your_guide_logo_squiggles.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/get_your_guide_logo_in_squiggles.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for GetYourGuide by DesignStudio\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo with lines.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/get_your_guide_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for GetYourGuide by DesignStudio\" \/>\n<figcaption>Barebones logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\" style=\"padding-bottom:65%\"><video controls controlsList=\"nodownload\" autoplay loop muted playsinline><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/get_your_guide_logo_formats.mov\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo formats.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo was pretty nice, with a bold arrow that could be interpreted as a location pinpoint icon, a marker for where to start a line, or even some kind of identifying ribbon worn by an actual guide person. Even without an interpretation, the logo was attractive (typeset in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.myfonts.com\/fonts\/type-together\/bree\/?refby=ucllc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bree<\/a>) and engaging. The new logo has two personalities: an expressive one that puts to use the five brand lines and a non-expressive one that is just, well, not expressive. Neither manages to feel as cheerful or approachable as the old one, especially not the straightforward logo, which feels very heavy, static, and not terribly exciting. The &#8220;hidden&#8221; arrow in the &#8220;G&#8221;s is not exactly hidden (nor novel) and they make the &#8220;G&#8221;s look extra dense. The expressive version of the logo sort of starts to convey the variety of their offerings and the excitement of doing something new but there is something very forced about how the lines are worked into the letters and the logo comes across as trying too hard to look fun.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video controls controlsList=\"nodownload\" poster=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/get_your_guide_squiggles.jpg\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/get_your_guide_squiggles.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<hr \/>\n<div class=\"video-container\"><video controls controlsList=\"nodownload\" poster=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/get_your_guide_squiggles_with_photos.jpg\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/get_your_guide_squiggles_with_photos.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Lines in action.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The lines in application are engaging with their different behaviors.
