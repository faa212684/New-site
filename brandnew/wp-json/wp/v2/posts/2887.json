After a public procurement process NSU recently introduced a new logo and identity designed by Stockholm-based <a href=\"http:\/\/soderhavet.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">S&ouml;derhavet<\/a> to help the five agencies communicate cohesively and to represent Sweden.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>The new identity reinstates the Swedish flag as the country&#8217;s primary identity bearer, reflecting the flag&#8217;s enduring status as Sweden&#8217;s most recognized symbol internationally. &#8220;We tried every possible permutation of every possible symbol, from crowns to crosses to abstract shapes, but we always came back to the flag,&#8221; says Mattias Svensson, Creative Director at S&ouml;derhavet. &#8220;It&#8217;s audacious to choose such an obvious symbol as the foundation for an identity, but I&#8217;m proud we did so &mdash; the flag will be just as relevant 20 years from now as it is today.&#8221;<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/soderhavet.com\/en\/2013\/11\/05\/swedens-global-brand-identity-unveiled\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">S&ouml;derhavet press release<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sverige_logos_animated_languages.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Sweden by S&ouml;derhavet\" \/>\n<figcaption>The main wordmark uses the Swedish word for Sweden, &#8220;Sverige&#8221;, while a secondary text above it translates the name.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>&#8220;We chose not to use &#8216;Sweden&#8217; as our textual mark,&#8221; says Joakim Nor&ecute;n, Brand Director at the Swedish Institute, a government agency. &#8220;Every time we use &#8216;Sverige&#8217; we have an opportunity to tell the world something about ourselves.

In execution its appreciation hinges on whether light monospace fonts whet your appetite or not. I&#8217;m not a big fan of monospace sans serifs but I can appreciate a cool one when I see it and this one establishes a contemporary Scandinavian design look that feels right at home in Sweden and is &#8220;strange&#8221; enough in other countries to stand out.<\/p>\n<p class=\"end\">Compare it to another popular country brand like Peru&#8217;s &mdash; one that is more graphically (and relatively) extravagant &mdash; and this feels exactly like the IKEA version of country branding. It&#8217;s a most economic suite of elements and comes with <a href=\"http:\/\/sweden.identitytool.com\/home\/development-and-inspiration\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a set of instructions<\/a> just like an EXPEDIT. Weak metaphors aside, the strength of this project lies in its role as a unifier for five separate organizations, each with its own logo, tone of voice, and audience from tourists to politicians to business people &mdash; they will still each do their own thing but with the flag and the word Sverige as the endorsing elements.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Sweden in a nutshell: Scandinavian country in Northern Europe; population of 9.5 million; capital is Stockholm; home of Ikea, Volvo, and Ericcson; cool.
