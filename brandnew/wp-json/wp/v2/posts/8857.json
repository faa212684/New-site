Equally divine are the new labels for the wine, designed by Brooklyn, NY-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.abrahamlule.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Abraham Lule<\/a>, who took elements from <a href=\"https:\/\/vexillology.fandom.com\/wiki\/Quer%C3%A9taro?file=Quer%C3%A9taro.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Queretaro&#8217;s coat of arms<\/a>, redrew them, and used them as a tone-on-tone background to then layer a slew of beautiful typographic treatments on it. Everything from the curvy MB monogram to the full name on a curve to the &#8220;QUERETARO&#8221; in the background is lovingly designed and while in principle none of the styles and approaches are visually related they all come together perfectly across the three different labels. As a bonus there is an excellent copper seal that features three wine cups and the negative space between them reveals the loose shape of two bottles. I&#8217;ll clink to that. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/90205733\/Maria-y-Bernardo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Ron Rebeli\u00f3n by Surchip and Juan Caicedo<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_ronrebelion.jpg\" alt=\"Ron Rebeli\u00f3n by Surchip and Juan Caicedo\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">I was not able to find a website or social media account for this so I can&#8217;t confirm if it&#8217;s real but I had a shortage of selections this week so I&#8217;ll give them the benefit of the doubt because this is fun (the design, not the giving of the benefit of the doubt). Ron Rebeli\u00f3n is, in theory, a rum made in Colombia named in honor of the town of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.colombia.co\/en\/colombia-country\/environment\/caribbean-region\/san-basilio-de-palenque-first-free-town-africans-americas\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Palenque<\/a>, considered to be the first free town for Africans in the Americas that rebelled against the Spaniards. Designed by Bogot\u00e1, Colombia-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/surchip\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Surchip<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/jotadejuan\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Juan Caicedo<\/a>, the label and graphics have a bold and explosive aesthetic that manages to capture the spirit of rebellion through a unique combination of typefaces and off-kilter treatments that build around the great illustration that depicts how the women of Palenque used their braided hair to send codes and hide gold within &#8212; I know this because I watched the video at the link not because I&#8217;m that well-versed in the Colonial history of Colombia. Point being, this is rad. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/98119443\/RON-REBELION\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Instituto Burle Marx by T\u00e1til Design<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_burlemarx.jpg\" alt=\"Instituto Burle Marx by T\u00e1til Design\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.institutoburlemarx.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Instituto Burle Marx<\/a> in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, celebrates the life and work of Roberto Burle Marx, a Brazilian artist most well known for his <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=burle+marx&#038;safe=active&#038;sxsrf=ALeKk01yjfNeypms3GCpMrIQ3WAWUroy_g:1592561850438&#038;source=lnms&#038;tbm=isch&#038;sa=X&#038;ved=2ahUKEwiG9IKb043qAhUTK80KHXPvD3gQ_AUoAXoECBsQAw&#038;biw=1337&#038;bih=833\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">landscape architecture<\/a> but who also was an avid painter, print maker, musician, and ecologist. The identity for the institute, designed by local firm <a href=\"https:\/\/tatil.com.br\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">T\u00e1til Design<\/a>, revolves around a custom typeface inspired by the effusive, organic, and unexpected shapes found throughout Marx&#8217;s work. The resulting typeface is impossible to classify and very difficult to rationalize in words other than to say it&#8217;s absolutely delightful and unexpected. The ligatures, united by sinuous curves are so joyful and add so much uniqueness to the identity. There aren&#8217;t any real-life applications shown unfortunately, which is something I prioritize for Friday  Likes selections but I really &#8212; REALLY &#8212; likes me that type and it&#8217;s Friday so here we are. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/87146999\/Instituto-Burle-Marx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Today we segue from beautiful type on labels to a label with funky type to funky type, period, with work from Brooklyn, Bogot\u00e1, and Rio de Janeiro&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[51,63,11,26],"tags":[146,725,261,1040,1133],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8857"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=8857"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8857\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=8857"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=8857"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=8857"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
