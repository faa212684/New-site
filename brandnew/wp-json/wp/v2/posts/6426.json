They were one of the first coffee roasters in the U.S. to establish an ethical Direct Trade program with coffee farmers around the world. As part of their 25th anniversary, PT&#8217;s recently introduced a new identity designed by Kansas City, MO-based <a href=\"https:\/\/carpentercollective.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Carpenter Collective<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>The inspiration behind the updated PT&#8217;s mark and identity happened on a visit to PT&#8217;s Coffee headquarters in Topeka, Kansas. Less than two miles from PT&#8217;s roasting facility, we drove by a herd of bison grazing on the Kansas prairie. The bison of the great plains represents strength, unity and abundance. PT&#8217;s wanted their new identity to be reflective of these same values as well and connect to their Midwest roots. The design style reinforces the hand-crafted nature of PT&#8217;s products&#8211;making their brand more approachable and memorable in the market.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/carpentercollective.com\/project\/pts-coffee-roasting-co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Carpenter Collective project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pts_roasting_coffee_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for PT&amp;apos;s Coffee Roasting Co. by Carpenter Collective\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pts_roasting_coffee_logo_inverse.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for PT&amp;apos;s Coffee Roasting Co. by Carpenter Collective\" \/>\n<figcaption>Inverse logo. Notice they didn&#8217;t just turn the same artwork to white but kept what&#8217;s white white and what&#8217;s blue blue.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo was very bland, with a somewhat sad-looking brush-like shape of a coffee plant on a pile of dirt. Not the most inspiring or distinctive. The new logo features the darndest, cutest, coolest bison you&#8217;ll find. It may not be immediately clear why there is a bison on a coffee roaster&#8217;s logo and even after learning why I&#8217;ll admit that it&#8217;s a loose-ended explanation but it&#8217;s such a fetching depiction that even if it were a jellyfish in that same style I would go along with it. The typography around the bison is bold and perfectly set in a circle. The logo sets the tone for a great range of illustrations and fun, expressive typography.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pts_roasting_coffee_graphic_doodads.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for PT&amp;apos;s Coffee Roasting Co. by Carpenter Collective\" \/>\n<figcaption>Illustrations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pts_roasting_coffee_old.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for PT&amp;apos;s Coffee Roasting Co. by Carpenter Collective\" \/>\n<figcaption>Small sampling of the old look.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>We created a labeling system that categorized PT&#8217;s 70+ roasts and allows them the flexibility to adjust and print each label on-site the day it is roasted.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/carpentercollective.com\/project\/pts-coffee-roasting-co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Carpenter Collective project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pts_roasting_coffee_packaging_bags_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for PT&amp;apos;s Coffee Roasting Co. by Carpenter Collective\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pts_roasting_coffee_packaging_bags_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for PT&amp;apos;s Coffee Roasting Co. by Carpenter Collective\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pts_roasting_coffee_packaging_bags_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for PT&amp;apos;s Coffee Roasting Co. by Carpenter Collective\" \/>\n<figcaption>New bags.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old packaging was mostly passable but it almost looked like motor oil packaging with the heavy use of chevron shapes. The brown color was also a bit heavy-handed and, yes, I understand coffee is brown but its use in the old look was a little too sad. The new packaging changes to a dark blue as its key color and it works beautifully on the new kraft paper bags with the logo rendering a little more subdued while the white labels pop with their brighter color palette. The illustrations are great and the typography is crisp and attractive.
