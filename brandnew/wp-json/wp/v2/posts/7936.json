The identity, designed by local firm <a href=\"https:\/\/bamff.ca\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bamff<\/a>, features, as you might expect, a canary bird and it&#8217;s a lovely rendition in a thick-line yet delicate approach. I really like how the body of the canary is a single stroke. It&#8217;s not exactly clear what the holding shape is &#8212; a bird cage? A tin badge of some sort? &#8212; but I also like it. The color palette is warm and inviting and the logo looks great on refillable containers, from soap bottles to totes. Not shown here is a nice accompanying serif, Klim&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/klim.co.nz\/retail-fonts\/domaine-text\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Domaine Text<\/a>, for the wordmark. Overall, a charming, feel-good identity. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/bamff.ca\/work\/canary-goods\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Miel Sagrada Maya by Bienal<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_miel_sagrada.jpg\" alt=\"Miel Sagrada Maya by Bienal\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/mielsagradamaya\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Miel Sagrada Maya<\/a> (&#8220;Sacred Mayan Honey&#8221;) is a range of honey-based products created by beekeeper, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.beecheii.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Beecheii<\/a>, in M\u00e9rida, Yucat\u00e1n, Mexico. The identity, designed by local firm <a href=\"https:\/\/bienal.mx\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bienal<\/a>, has a great raw and organic aesthetic applied to the wordmark and the icon &#8212; which at first I was sure it&#8217;s a plant and then I was sure it&#8217;s a bee and now I&#8217;m confused as to what it is yet visually I like whatever it is. Like Canary above, this has a nice green and yellow\/gold color combo that alludes to bee&#8217;s environment and their product. What I like most about this is that it feels as if the owners designed this in a naive, undesigned way but it just happened to turn out awesome. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/82480201\/MIEL-SAGRADA-MAYA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Simple Goods by Kati Forner Design<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_simplegoods.jpg\" alt=\"Simple Goods by Kati Forner Design\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/simplegoods.dk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Simple Goods<\/a> is a new brand in Denmark of non-toxic cleaning products made with natural and plant-based ingredients. The identity, designed by Los Angeles, CA-based <a href=\"https:\/\/katiforner.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kati Forner Design<\/a>, honors the name with a simple and good logo that wraps the name inside an implied circle, overlapping a non-implied circle for a nice, clean composition that looks great on the pink and gray backgrounds for the different products. Everything has a clean yet warm aesthetic and it&#8217;s the kind of product you might end up buying just for the packaging alone &#8212; it&#8217;s like a Danish <a href=\"https:\/\/methodhome.com\/beyond-the-bottle\/packaging\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Method<\/a>. My favorite thing in all of this, though, are the brown scrubby things with the tags, like cute baby porcupines with a side of nice design.  <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/84156755\/Simple-Goods\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Lots of clean-living and simple designs this week, with work from Alberta, M\u00e9rida, and Los Angeles&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[51,11,86,26],"tags":[1207,1732,916,53],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7936"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=7936"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7936\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=7936"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=7936"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=7936"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
