Designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/beau.designbureau.ca\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Studio Beau<\/a> (and headed by designer <a href=\"http:\/\/cpen10.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Charlene Sepentzis<\/a>, who hosts the project images), the identity revolves around a bad-ass logo in the form of an arrow tip. And it&#8217;s not a pretty, friendly, hipstery arrow tip. No, this is like a Mongol chasing after your village arrow tip. It&#8217;s sharp, it&#8217;s aggressive. And it&#8217;s really well done. The &#8220;C&#8221; sort of breaks the rhythm, but it&#8217;s still damn cool. <a href=\"http:\/\/cpen10.com\/La-Fleche\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Badaboom by KIND<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_badaboom.jpg\" alt=\"Badaboom by KIND\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.badaboom.no\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Badaboom<\/a> is a Norwegian manufacturer of clothes for babies, children, women, and men, as well as beddings. Their spin is that all their fabrics are made from bamboo, which not only reportedly makes for super smooth clothing and bed sheets but also makes for a wonderful foundation for an identity. Designed by Bergen, Norway-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kindnorway.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">KIND<\/a>, the wordmark follows the rhythm of bamboo shoots seen from above and a beautiful and simple pattern imitates bamboo seen from the front, with its irregular, wild-angled notches. Barely applied as a deboss or 1-color silkscreen on packaging, the elements give this brand a premium and sophisticated look that is also earthy. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kindnorway.com\/work?category=1&#038;client=24\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Leader Bag Co by Lotta Nieminen<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_leaderbagco.jpg\" alt=\"Leader Bag Co by Lotta Nieminen\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">Designed by three sisters, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.leaderbagco.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Leader Bag Co<\/a> offers a high-end diaper bag for the discerning &mdash; and, at $425 a pop, cash-flow-advantaged &mdash; mom. The bags&#8217; minimal and luxurious production is matched by the logo designed by New York, NY-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lottanieminen.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lotta Nieminen<\/a>. While the uppercase, sans serif wordmark isn&#8217;t anything out of the ordinary and looks as pretty as expected on a beautiful product, what I love about this project is the safety pin icon. It&#8217;s perfectly executed in its simplicity and looks so good in its trompe l&#8217;oeil effect that makes it appear as if it&#8217;s been fastened to the product or business card. It&#8217;s a great example of creating dimension and depth without relying on gradients or shadows. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lottanieminen.com\/graphic-design\/leader-bag-co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project here<\/strong><\/a><\/strong>.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"We start the year off with a set of minimal and beautiful logos with work from Montreal, Bergen, and New York&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[105,769,564],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3695"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3695"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3695\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3695"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3695"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3695"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
