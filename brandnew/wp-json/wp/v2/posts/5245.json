The inline obviously adds to the texture but it&#8217;s also the way the corners of each letter (except for the &#8220;O&#8221;) resolve that adds a layer of visual interest. It&#8217;s a great, bold, contemporary, luxurious wordmark. The overly spaced &#8220;ROXY CINEMAS&#8221; is maybe too spaced but I do appreciate how it&#8217;s spaced to fit between the &#8220;R&#8221; and &#8220;Y&#8221;. I have zero ability to discern what&#8217;s going on in the Arabic typography but it also seems&#8230; very spaced with the long horizontal lines. As an Engligh\/Arabic unit, it&#8217;s pretty well resolved.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/roxy_cinemas_animation.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Roxy Cinemas by Ochre\" \/>\n<figcaption>Animation (with visible grid for the logo).<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/roxy_cinemas_various_materials.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Roxy Cinemas by Ochre\" \/>\n<figcaption>Various materials.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The print applications are dead-simple, relying on materials and rich floods of ink to establish a confident aesthetic. Despite being kraft paper, the applications feel upscale much in part due to the logo and its perfect sizing and positioning. The hints of orange add a nice visual burst. The one odd thing might be the underlined, uppercase typography that is maybe too in your face.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/roxy_cinemas_window_sign.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Roxy Cinemas by Ochre\" \/>\n<figcaption>Window sign.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/roxy_cinemas_signage.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Roxy Cinemas by Ochre\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/roxy_cinemas_signage_detail.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Roxy Cinemas by Ochre\" \/>\n<figcaption>Signage.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/roxy_cinemas_uniform.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Roxy Cinemas by Ochre\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/roxy_cinemas_uniform_detail.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Roxy Cinemas by Ochre\" \/>\n<figcaption>Uniform.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/roxy_cinemas_staircase.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Roxy Cinemas by Ochre\" \/>\n<figcaption>Bag on an escalator.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/roxy_cinemas_website.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Roxy Cinemas by Ochre\" \/>\n<figcaption>Website.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/roxy_cinemas_app.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Roxy Cinemas by Ochre\" \/>\n<figcaption>Mobile app.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/roxy_cinemas_popcorn.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Roxy Cinemas by Ochre\" \/>\n<figcaption>Popcorn.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">Everything has clearly been very well considered and no expenses spared in materials and reproduction. Uniform vests usually look dopey but these are pretty slick. Overall, this is a greatly executed upscale identity that doesn&#8217;t feel pretentious and could easily expand from the two-three current locations to a global chain of luxury movie theaters.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Launched this year, Roxy Cinemans is a small chain of luxury cinemas in Dubai.
