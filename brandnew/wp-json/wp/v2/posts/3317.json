While maintaing its famous logo intact, Canal+ has introduced a new identity around it and new on-air look designed by Madrid, Spain-based <a href=\"http:\/\/erretres.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Erretres<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>From CANAL+&#8217;s logo, the different elements of secondary identity have been developed, expanding the brand communication. On one hand, the logo becomes a window that facilitates the incorporation of images and where the user enters literally. Furthermore, the logo becomes a dialog box that serves as a graphic resource for incorporating holders, messages, and again, the user&#8217;s voice. It is a resource that has multiple variations, serving to highlight information, underline holders, display conversations, etc..<br \/><br \/>We have also developed what we call the &#8220;step&#8221; which is a reserved area, which relies on the upper or lower margin of the pieces and lets you put all corporate elements such as logo, website, contact numbers, the product Yomvi and information about the advertised product.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/erretres.com\/drivenbydesign\/erretres-renueva-la-marca-canal\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Erretres project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/99084196?byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=9e5893\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>On-air montage.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/canal_es_business_cards.jpg\" alt=\"New Identity and On-Air Look for Canal+ by Erretres\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/canal_es_livery.jpg\" alt=\"New Identity and On-Air Look for Canal+ by Erretres\" \/>\n<figcaption>Livery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/canal_es_language.jpg\" alt=\"New Identity and On-Air Look for Canal+ by Erretres\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/canal_es_language_rectangle.jpg\" alt=\"New Identity and On-Air Look for Canal+ by Erretres\" \/>\n<figcaption>Visual language.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/canal_es_posters.jpg\" alt=\"New Identity and On-Air Look for Canal+ by Erretres\" \/>\n<figcaption>Posters\/ads.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/canal_es_billboard_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Identity and On-Air Look for Canal+ by Erretres\" \/>\n<figcaption>Prototype billboard.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/canal_es_rubio.jpg\" alt=\"New Identity and On-Air Look for Canal+ by Erretres\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/canal_es_minions.jpg\" alt=\"New Identity and On-Air Look for Canal+ by Erretres\" \/>\n<figcaption>Framing device.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">Taking a cue from the + sign in the logo the new look does a great job of giving the speech bubble a somewhat fresh approach with the rectangular construction that can work both as a tight and modular puzzle or as a looser connected chain of boxes trickling from each other, establishing a hierarchy of information. At times the whole package looks like a really tame take on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=wolfgang+weingart&#038;source=lnms&#038;tbm=isch&#038;sa=X&#038;ei=ypWyU7u3MdGNqAaivIDwAw&#038;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ&#038;biw=1720&#038;bih=866\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wolfgang Weingart&#8217;s<\/a> work with all the stepped boxes and boxed typography, so that&#8217;s kind of cool. In animation, the + sign moves and stretches quite enjoyably as it catches up with itself while the rest of the elements pop and slide smoothly. The overall sense of humor in the copywriting also helps deliver a fresh voice for the network. Not knowing what the previous Canal+ on-air package looked like, it&#8217;s hard to compare and contrast but I would be happy if my NBC looked half as good as this.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Launched in 1990 in Spain and known as Digital+ until 2011, Canal+ is satellite broadcasting network with fifteen different channels ranging from primetime shows, movies, sports, news, plus a channel devoted to bull fighting (!).
