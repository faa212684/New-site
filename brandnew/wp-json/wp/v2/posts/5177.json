Each country is represented by a singer performing an original song and then the viewing public selects the winner. Nearly 200 million people watch the televised event, which itself is quite a spectacle. Past winners have included ABBA and Celine Dion before either were <em>ABBA<\/em> or <em>Celine Dion<\/em> as we know them today. Each year, the competition is hosted by a different country and as long as they use the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/new_logo_for_eurovision_song_contest_by_storytegic.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Eurovision logo<\/a>, each edition has its own identity. Taking place in Kyiv, Ukraine, this May, this year&#8217;s identity has been designed by local firms <a href=\"http:\/\/banda.agency\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">banda.agency<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/republique.com.ua\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Republique<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>We started looking for the symbol that would be authentic for Ukrainian culture as well as identify mission of the contest. Therefore, as a basis for Eurovision &#8211; 2017 visual identity we have chosen traditional ukrainian necklace, elements of which symbolise participants of the contest. Bead after bead, countries, which take part in Eurovision, together create a captivating celebration of music.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/banda.agency\/eurovision\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">banda.agency project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/eurovision_song_contest_2017_reference.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Eurovision Song Contest 2017 by banda.agency and Republique\" \/>\n<figcaption>Traditional Ukrainian necklaces served as the main reference.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>Having used a traditional Ukrainian symbol, we have also given it a modern look with bright live patterns.

This year, though, even if the Eurovision logo stands out even more than past editions, the identity behind it (literally) is awesome and strong enough that I can (again, literally) look past it. And it&#8217;s not that the Eurovision logo is bad but it&#8217;s not a logo that has been designed to integrate gently with anything else. Anyway&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>The bead concept is well founded in a piece of Ukrainian tradition and then it&#8217;s excitingly visualized as a range of groovy patterns mapped around spheres and donut-like beads. The mix of shapes used in the patterns is varied and eclectic but nicely unified by the coral red color. On their own they look rad but they also work together in a surprisingly <em>not<\/em> cloying way when they form a necklace. As a lock-up with the tagline and the Eurovision logo, it&#8217;s not really that good and the use of Gotham seems off but it&#8217;s easy to move past it as the applications are quite entertaining.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/eurovision_song_contest_2017_stamps.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Eurovision Song Contest 2017 by banda.agency and Republique\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stamps.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/eurovision_song_contest_2017_stands.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Eurovision Song Contest 2017 by banda.agency and Republique\" \/>\n<figcaption>Outdoor ads.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/eurovision_song_contest_2017_tshirt.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Eurovision Song Contest 2017 by banda.agency and Republique\" \/>\n<figcaption>T-shirt.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/eurovision_song_contest_2017_totes.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Eurovision Song Contest 2017 by banda.agency and Republique\" \/>\n<figcaption>Totes.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/eurovision_song_contest_2017_wristbands.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Eurovision Song Contest 2017 by banda.agency and Republique\" \/>\n<figcaption>Wristbands.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/eurovision_song_contest_2017_umbrellas.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Eurovision Song Contest 2017 by banda.agency and Republique\" \/>\n<figcaption>Umbrellas.
