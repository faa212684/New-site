The museum is housed in the Church of St Mary-at-Lambeth in London, UK, which is the burial place of John Tradescant (c1570 &#8211; 1638), whom the museum calls &#8220;the first great gardener and plant-hunter in British history&#8221; and whose tomb, located in the garden of the church, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=John+Tradescant+tomb&#038;lr=lang_en&#038;tbs=lr:lang_1en&#038;source=lnms&#038;tbm=isch&#038;sa=X&#038;ved=0ahUKEwj7h8Kh_7XWAhWl7oMKHXgvCGIQ_AUICygC&#038;biw=1703&#038;bih=864\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">is epic<\/a>. The museum offers a permanent collection &#8212; paintings, tools, ephemera and historic artifacts &#8212; temporary exhibitions, events, garden, and a caf\u00e9. From 2015 to 2017, the museum closed temporarily and underwent a renovation, reopening this past May and introducing a new identity designed by London-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pentagram.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pentagram<\/a> partners Luke Powell and Jody Hudson-Powell.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>The museum&#8217;s wordmark is set in Humanist 970, a font that is based on Doric, a very early sans serif released by the Stephenson Blake Foundry in 1816. As with other fonts released during this time period, it is organic and imperfect in nature, creating a characterful letter set. <br \/><br \/>A key focus while developing the identity was to create a system that could flex and scale based on the audience. The bold wordmark can live on its own strongly when required but also quickly become inviting and lively when the shapes and illustrations start to come into play.<\/blockquote><h3>Pentagram provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/garden_museum_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Garden Museum by Pentagram\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/garden_museum_business_cards.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Garden Museum by Pentagram\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo was relatively okay in that it was set in a peculiar font and it was sort of museum-ish and had a garden-ish color. The new logo, on its own, can be described pretty much the same way: it&#8217;s a peculiar font, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.myfonts.com\/fonts\/bitstream\/humanist-970\/?refby=ucllc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Humanist 970<\/a>, that looks museum-ish and has a garden-ish green color. So far, it&#8217;s a parallel move with each logo having its pros and cons but the new logo has a lovely range of flora around and behind it that instantly transforms it into something more memorable, relevant, and attractive through the combination of the wide wordmark in the deep green with the oversize graphic patterns.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/garden_museum_color_palette.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Garden Museum by Pentagram\" \/>\n<figcaption>Color palette.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>Inspired by the work of Brazilian landscape artist Roberto Burle Marx, Pentagram created a visual language out of different forms and colours to represent seasons and flora. This language can be both visually expressive and functional, used to create illustrations when brought together and individual icons when pulled apart.<br \/><br \/>The palette of shapes are interpretations of the organic forms native to different seasons. &#8220;These shapes are deliberately imperfect and abstract, but when constructed into compositions give a feeling of a living garden,&#8221; said Luke Powell.<\/blockquote><h3>Pentagram provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/garden_museum_icons.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Garden Museum by Pentagram\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icons.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/garden_museum_icon_fork.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Garden Museum by Pentagram\" \/>\n<figcaption>Garden fork icon for social media.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/garden_museum_seasons.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Garden Museum by Pentagram\" \/>\n<figcaption>Season colors and arrangements.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The illustrations are charming, fun, and a great interpretation of &#8220;gardens&#8221; where they convey all the kinds of stuff you would find in one, from leafs to branches to insects, all in an abstract, minimalist style that feels lively and inviting. The supporting font, <a href=\"https:\/\/store.typenetwork.com\/foundry\/occupant\/fonts\/amira\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amira<\/a>, has a chiseled structure that evokes the inscriptions one could find in old buildings, like the church the museum lives in.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/garden_museum_letterhead.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Garden Museum by Pentagram\" \/>\n<figcaption>Letterhead.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/garden_museum_sample_poster.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Garden Museum by Pentagram\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/garden_museum_sample_poster_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Garden Museum by Pentagram\" \/>\n<figcaption>Posters.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/garden_museum_invitation.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Garden Museum by Pentagram\" \/>\n<figcaption>Invitation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/garden_museum_guide.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Garden Museum by Pentagram\" \/>\n<figcaption>Guide.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The way the illustration density is modulated in different ways &#8212; sometimes loose as in the letterhead, sometimes dense as in the invitation &#8212; along with the seasonal color palette provides plenty of flexibility and keeps the identity interesting and engaging.
