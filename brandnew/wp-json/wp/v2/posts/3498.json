The HeForShe campaign was brought to the forefront thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/youtu.be\/Q0Dg226G2Z8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a heartfelt speech from Emma Watson<\/a> that clearly emphasized the need for both genders to work together. The logo and identity for the movement has been designed by New York, NY-based <a href=\"http:\/\/dia.tv\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DIA<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>The HeForShe logo mark represents this solidarity movement by joining together aspects of both the female and male symbols.\u00a0 This union symbolizes women and men working together to make gender equality a reality. This mark does not favor the male or female symbol, but blends them together creating a new symbol\u00a0for humanity and gender equality.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/dia.tv\/heforshe\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DIA project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/heforshe_logo_detail.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for HeForShe by DIA\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The icon picks up pieces from <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gender_symbol\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the male and female gender symbols<\/a> to form a new icon making it identifiable with the cause but without being overly prescriptive or literal about it. The implied cross formed by the two shapes also gives it a sense of urgency and of something that needs to be fixed. At times I want to read the black shape as an &#8220;L&#8221; and I wish there was a better integration between the two contrasting shapes, as opposed to just one on top of the other, in order to convey the need for unity a little better. It&#8217;s hard to predict yet whether this icon will rise to the prominence of other cause icons &mdash; whether it&#8217;s the AIDS ribbon or even the peace symbol originally meant to represent a weapons disarmament movement &mdash; but it clearly has the potential in its simplicity.<\/p>\n<p>The wordmark is fantastically ambiguous and it really manages to capture a neutrality that makes it neither masculine nor feminine, yet it&#8217;s really both. And the color palette is both stark and vibrant&hellip; I could see both me or my wife wearing the exact same HeForShe t-shirt in this color palette with equal comfort and conviction.<\/p>\n<blockquote>Overall, the identity communicates with shared masculine and feminine sensibilities.\u00a0 The typography is bold, but thoughtful while the colors are powerful, warm and energetic.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/dia.tv\/heforshe\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DIA project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/heforshe_stationery.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for HeForShe by DIA\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stationery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/heforshe_business_card.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for HeForShe by DIA\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business card.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/heforshe_brochure_cover.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for HeForShe by DIA\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brochure cover.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/heforshe_editorial.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for HeForShe by DIA\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sample editorial spreads.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/heforshe_scarf.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for HeForShe by DIA\" \/>\n<figcaption>Scarf.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/heforshe_posters_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for HeForShe by DIA\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/heforshe_posters_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for HeForShe by DIA\" \/>\n<figcaption>Posters.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/heforshe_event_ticket.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for HeForShe by DIA\" \/>\n<figcaption>United Nations special event ticket.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/heforshe_emma_watson.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for HeForShe by DIA\" \/>\n<figcaption>Emma Watson delivering her speech on September 20, 2014.

It&#8217;s enjoyably flexible &mdash; and gender equal!
