My Rapid Transit Logo Contest Winner<\/strong><\/span><br \/>&#8220;The MRT [MyRapidTransit] system will be the backbone of the new sustainable transport system in Klang Valley, which will be home to an estimated 10 million people by 2020.&#8221; And what better way to celebrate such an ambitious project than with a logo contest? Oh, yes, you leave the winner up to public voting. The winner and 19 runner-ups are posted <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mrtcontest.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a>. <em>This<\/em> is why logo contests are scary.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to Harvard Wang for the tip.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"red\"><strong>2. Goodby, Silverstein &amp; Partners&#8217; &#8220;New&#8221; Logo<\/strong><\/span><br \/>The new logo for the renown ad agency has been making the rounds for being a modified lift of a monogram drawn in 1905 found in the compilation <em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Monograms-Ciphers-Dover-Pictorial-Archive\/dp\/0486221822\/uc-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Monograms and Ciphers<\/a><\/em> by Albert Angus Turbayne. The logo recently won a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.canneslions.com\/work\/design\/entry.cfm?entryid=9761&#038;award=101&#038;from=401&#038;to=450&#038;order=2&#038;direction=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cannes Lion Award<\/a>. After much speculation on whether it was a rip-off or not, founder Rich Silverstein <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mediabistro.com\/agencyspy\/rich-silverstein-responds-to-logo-issue_b22003\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sets the record straight<\/a>: &#8220;So it&#8217;s not a coincidence that the logo looks like a 100 year old ligature.  It was 100% intentional.  I found it in my library in a book of ligatures that I&#8217;ve had for 30 years and always admired.  I thought it would be nice to take something old and ignored and reimagine it. And that&#8217;s what I did.&#8221; Keep it classy ad agencies, keep it classy.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to Ryan McCullah for first tip.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"red\"><strong>3. Logo Garden Sells Logos it doesn&#8217;t Own<\/strong><\/span><br \/>We all know that buying logos off of a website isn&#8217;t ideal and how it diminishes the efforts of us, hard-working logo designers, etc. But a new low has been reached by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.logogarden.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Logo Garden<\/a> which is a DIY logo making website that is selling icons created by other designers.
