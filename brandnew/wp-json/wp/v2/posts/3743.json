Designed by Seoul-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.contentformcontext.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> ContentFormContext<\/a> the logo for this rice wine brewery in the South Korean city of Paju is inspired by old maps from the Joseon Dynasty and, if I understand correctly, the abstracted letterforms spell out Miin Brewery. Even if I don&#8217;t understand correctly I just love looking at this. More than the swoopy line-type, I am very much liking the small barrel-and-pagoda-like supporting mark. And as a whole, with the bottle choice, paper texture, and a bit of the wine color showing through, this is a very good-looking wine. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/23063481\/Miin-Brewery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project here<\/strong><\/a><\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Number 6 Ciders by Creature<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_6cider.jpg\" alt=\"No. 6 Cider by Creature\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">Based in Seattle, WA, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.6cider.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Number 6 Ciders<\/a> is a hard cider microbrewery with a very comprehensive and extensive set of logos and graphic representations designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/welcometocreature.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Creature<\/a>. And all of them are awesome. This is definitely a more is more kind of identity that includes everything from chiseled numbers to condensed industrial sans serifs to flared serifs to scripts to shields to aspirational messages. It&#8217;s all in there and more. A few other links that help illustrate the above-hipster coolness of this are the <a href=\"http:\/\/static.squarespace.com\/static\/5463087de4b0263200e061a2\/t\/546e657de4b00a246b4855f9\/1416521085778\/background.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">background image<\/a> of their site and this <a href=\"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/111775343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">about video<\/a>. I would love to peek through their assets folder. (Come to think of it, that sounds like a great pick-up line after a few hard ciders). <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/22179459\/No-6-Cider\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Bao Bao by Eszter Laki<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_baobao.jpg\" alt=\"Bao Bao by Eszter Laki\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">If you live or ever find yourself in Budapest, Hungary, and are craving dim sum, Bao Bao is the place to go, if not for the dim sum at least for the interiors (by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.81font.hu\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">81font architects<\/a>) and identity by local designer <a href=\"http:\/\/www.behance.net\/lakieszti\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Eszter Laki<\/a>. The simple logo that repeats the word &#8220;Bao&#8221; (meaning Dumpling) is a decent one and we&#8217;ve seen logos applied as rubber stamps a hundred times but, here, with these particular materials, placement, and orientations, it looks freshly tasty &mdash; especially on the bamboo steamer basket. The soy sauce bottle looks great too, almost like a high-end balsamic vinegar. Overall, very simple centered typography throughout, great textures, and very appetizing photographs to present the work. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/18420491\/BAOBAO\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Get ready to have your taste glands salivating this Friday with wine, hard cider, and dim sum work from Seoul, Seattle, and Budapest&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[1122,745,564,1133],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3743"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3743"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3743\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3743"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3743"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3743"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
