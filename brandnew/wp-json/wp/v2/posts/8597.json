The city of Morshyn (Lviv oblast, Ukraine) is situated on a hillside in the eastern part of the Carpathian mountain range, 340m above sea level. Virgin Carpathian forests surround the city, ensuring the areas ancient ecological purity. The Madonna source, from which Morshynska rises, was discovered in 1879 and has long been the subject of legend.
