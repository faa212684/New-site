The identity, by Dallas-based <a href=\"http:\/\/tractorbeam.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tractorbeam<\/a> is an avalanche of 1950s clip art, script exclamations, and lo-fi typography, all executed to perfection with a more-is-more sensibility. The lead role of the identity is played by the varsity-jacket-wearing rabbit who exudes both an innocent and creepy vibe. The typography all around the venue &#8212; in menus and murals &#8212; is superb, all done in a way that look straight out of the atomic age. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/tractorbeam.com\/case-study\/heritage-pizza\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Matter Made by Lotta Nieminen<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_mattermade.jpg\" alt=\"Matter Made by Lotta Nieminen\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/mattermade.us\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Matter Made<\/a> is a manufacturer of contemporary lighting, furniture, and objects in Brooklyn, New York. Their penchant for clean lines and simple shapes is exemplified in their identity by local designer <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lottanieminen.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lotta Nieminen<\/a> who strikes again with another super minimalist design that looks stunning. Easy to miss is a detail in the wordmark (and &#8220;M.M&#8221; monogram) where the two &#8220;M&#8221;s are different; the first has straight stems, the second angled. It&#8217;s a tiny detail but it&#8217;s a great one, and it looks particularly good in the applications where the &#8220;M.M&#8221; is used big. The blue and rusted red color palette is quite nice too and, as someone mentioned in the Friday Likes comments <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_228.php#comment-3645276542\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">recently<\/a>, this fills my weekly quota of gold foil stamping. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.lottanieminen.com\/graphicdesign\/matter-made\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Blanca by Futura<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_blanca.jpg\" alt=\"Blanca by Futura\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/blancamerida.mx\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Blanca<\/a> is a high-end, residential community in the town of Kikteil, near Merida, Mexico. The identity, designed by Mexico City-based <a href=\"http:\/\/byfutura.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Futura<\/a> features a swarming-dot icon meant to represent community and while that could easily be cloying, the execution is sharp, elegant, and moody, looking like an eclipse. The icon is complemented by a spaced out geometric sans serif that looks pretty nice against all the white space of the materials and a perhaps-too-largely-typeset serif. The applications where the swarm is die-cut or debossed add an extra touch of high-end-ness. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/byfutura.com\/project\/blanca\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"From dense and ornate to bare minimum, we cover a good range of projects with work from Dallas, Brooklyn, and Mexico City&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[51,11,83,85,26],"tags":[1515,186,261,762],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6085"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=6085"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6085\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=6085"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=6085"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=6085"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
