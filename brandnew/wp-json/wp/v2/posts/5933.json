The textures are inspired by the landscape of Colorado Springs and serve as a fantastic adornment for the coffee cups. The stubby, flared serifs on the logo and custom typography provide a nice, unique element for the identity and the blue is one level of contrast below <em>that blue<\/em> that softens the whole look. I wish the bags had a hint of the textures, as they feel almost like a separate project&#8230; an also nice different project but perhaps the band underneath the label would have been a good spot to have it. Nonetheless, sharp. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/studiomast.co\/projects\/loyal-coffee\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Verdura by Glasfurd &amp; Walker<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_verdura.jpg\" alt=\"Verdura by Glasfurd &amp; Walker\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.verdurasalads.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Verdura<\/a> (meaning &#8220;Vegetable&#8221;) is a fast-casual restaurant in Vancouver specializing in salads, using only fresh produce served in what looks like a chic greenhouse. The identity by local firm <a href=\"https:\/\/glasfurdandwalker.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Glasfurd &amp; Walker<\/a> relies on a stunning custom typeface that has a crisp, elegant, contemporary look that works particularly well in the shade of green chosen. The identity also features framing devices that reference the curves and details of a greenhouse to make a combination that looks as tasty as their salads. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/glasfurdandwalker.com\/project\/verdura\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">January Moon by Perky Bros<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_januarymoon.jpg\" alt=\"January Moon by Perky Bros\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.januarymoon.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">January Moon<\/a> is a line of contemporary teething jewelry from artist\/designer Jenny Luckett using non-toxic 100% silicone to create funky, colorful beads that moms can wear with joy and babies can chew with abandon. The identity by Nashville, TN-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.perkybros.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Perky Bros<\/a> echoes the minimal, colorful bead shapes with its own range of minimal, colorful, cut-paper-like shapes in a primary color palette that are sprinkled big and sparingly over stark white layouts. There is a &#8220;jm&#8221; monogram that accents most applications and a handsome sans serif wordmark. Some bonus extra charming illustrations complete the package for a fun and fashionable product line. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.perkybros.com\/portfolio\/january-moon\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Lots of color this week, with work from Denver, Vancouver, and Nashville&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[51,11,85,26],"tags":[597,965,564],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5933"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=5933"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5933\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=5933"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=5933"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=5933"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
