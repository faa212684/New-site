If you&#8217;ve ever stapled a flyer to a post, then you&#8217;ve most likely used the T50.

The new logo salvages the squat, italic typography and creates a sturdy, handsome, and active new wordmark with a great rhythm. The arrow has been minimized from the large holding shape to a chevron which, if not necessarily original, it gets the job done in punctuating the name.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/arrow_books_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Arrow Fastener Company by Nail\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brand books box with foil stamp logos.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/arrow_books_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Arrow Fastener Company by Nail\" \/>\n<figcaption>Inside, the box contains two narrow books &mdash; one for the Brand Guidelines, the other for the Brand Essence &mdash; that form the new icon.

Also: Futura. Lots of Futura. Overall, a really great redesign that will hopefully bring more name recognition to a company that makes something as awesome and awesomely named as the T50&reg; Heavy Duty Tacker Gun.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1929, Arrow Fastener Company specializes in things that put together things, otherwise known as &#8220;fastening&#8221; tools, providing manual, electric and cordless versions of rivet tools, glue guns, hammer tackers, and their flagship product, the heavy duty T50&reg; staple&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,51,26],"tags":[913,108,153,309,446],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2589"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2589"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2589\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2589"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2589"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2589"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
