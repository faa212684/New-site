Earlier this year, Stannis introduced new packaging and promo items for all of its beers (while the logo remains the same) designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.firmorama.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Firmorama<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/stannis_beer_old_label.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for Stannis by Firmorama\" \/>\n<figcaption>Old label.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The labels were created from inspirations that come since of the brewing culture to the baptismal name of Stannis, and connections between them. We worked in a unique typography to identify the names of each one, with lots of personality, as well as the Stannis beers. All the beers have a name and bring with them a story. We extend this individuality to identify each one by a different color and symbolizing each one with an illustrated character, each with their own story and personality.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/file\/d\/0B6Kq-jbw-W1HOTBTc2tabTFVNUE\/edit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Firmorama press release<\/a><\/h3>\n<p>All photos and video by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.blackxhouse.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Black House<\/a>.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/stannis_beer_all.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for Stannis by Firmorama\" \/>\n<figcaption>Full line-up of beers.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t take a beer or design connoisseur to note that the old bottles were a sad-looking bunch with their oversized logo, poor slab typography, and clear labeling that was just a notch above scotch tape. More power to the beer for growing a fan base! The new look &mdash; that maintains the logo, unfortunately &mdash; and print production is a million hops better, going with a weird amalgam of a Hipster-Renaissance aesthetic that you will either love or hate. I kinda love it even though I hate some of the resulting letterforms in the beer names. The commitment from top to bottom on these labels, though, is quite convincing.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/stannis_beer_labels.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for Stannis by Firmorama\" \/>\n<figcaption>Individual beer logos.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/stannis_beer_all_detail.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for Stannis by Firmorama\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/stannis_beer_all_detail_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for Stannis by Firmorama\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/stannis_beer_all_detail_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for Stannis by Firmorama\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/stannis_beer_all_detail_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for Stannis by Firmorama\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sexy detail shots.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/stannis_beer_coasters.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for Stannis by Firmorama\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/stannis_beer_coasters_detail.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for Stannis by Firmorama\" \/>\n<figcaption>Coasters.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/stannis_beer_draft.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for Stannis by Firmorama\" \/>\n<figcaption>Taps.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/101097753?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=ffec00\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>The making of Red Sonja.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">My favorite part of the labels are the individual illustrations for each beer kind.
