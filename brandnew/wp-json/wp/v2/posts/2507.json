They have won one Stanley Cup (in the 1998-99 season) but have missed the playoffs for the past five seasons. Looking to spice things up, the Stars unveiled its new uniforms and logo yesterday &mdash; although the logo <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sbnation.com\/nhl\/2013\/5\/24\/4362316\/dallas-stars-new-logo-uniform\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">leaked<\/a> through the team&#8217;s mobile app at the end of May &mdash; designed by Reebok.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>&#8220;We looked at every team in Dallas, in Texas, anything that surrounded us, bordered us or felt that was relevant to us,&#8221; said Walsh. &#8220;We looked at the different logos around the league and decided what we liked and didn&#8217;t like about all of them. Then we created this 36-page brief to the NHL and they were floored by how detailed it was, and we kind of laid out a direct path to Reebok of where we wanted to go.&#8221;<br \/><br \/>Reebok responded with four designs, which the Stars didn&#8217;t like. But they liked elements from one of them.<br \/><br \/>&#8220;This is where the process started to turn,&#8221; said Walsh. &#8220;Once we got the initial stuff from Reebok, we started really internally becoming creatively involved. This is where all the different variations of the jerseys started to come together because we were able to do it faster than they were. We were able to do it in the same day in most cases.&#8221;<br \/><br \/>The first item the Stars were able to settle on was the primary logo, which consisted of a D and a Star.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/stars.nhl.com\/club\/news.htm?id=672977&#038;navid=DL|DAL|home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Very detailed behind-the-scenes post<\/a> (further quotes in captions below)<\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/dallas_stars_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"Dallas Stars Logo, Identity, and Uniforms\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Main logo, detail. &#8220;&#8216;I&#8217;m excited. My hope is the logo is one that they&#8217;ll love,&#8217; Gaglardi said. &#8216;It&#8217;s one that is void of any word mark, but I think any fan will look at it and see a D and a Star. There&#8217;s only one Big D, so I feel the logo will be pretty easily recognizable. I love its simplicity.'&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/dallas_stars_logo_alternate.gif\" alt=\"Dallas Stars Logo, Identity, and Uniforms\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Alternate logo (used on shoulder patch). &#8220;When we went to the new D and Star, we lost any kind of word mark within the primary logo itself. That&#8217;s why we felt it was important to have the words &#8216;Dallas&#8217; and &#8216;Stars&#8217; on the shoulder patch.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/dallas_stars_logo_on_texas.gif\" alt=\"Dallas Stars Logo, Identity, and Uniforms\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Alternate logo (used on pant shell). &#8220;&#8216;One of the big discussions in our group was continuing the tie to the state of Texas because we are the only NHL team in this massive state,&#8217; said Walsh. &#8216;We wanted the state of Texas represented somewhere, so we have a logo that does appear on the pant shell and it&#8217;s the D-Star and the state of Texas. We were always partial to our old shoulder crest.'&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/dallas_stars_wordmark.gif\" alt=\"Dallas Stars Logo, Identity, and Uniforms\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Wordmark.<\/p>\n<p>The previous logo was pretty terrible: ugly typography, ugly color combination, and, well, just ugly and rusty. The new logo, by contrast and in the relative context of sports branding, is super pretty and shiny. That don&#8217;t mean I like it &mdash; I do, relatively speaking, but I don&#8217;t, in the larger context of logo design. It&#8217;s a vast improvement that maintains the structure and equity of the old one through the italicized star but brings in all the clich&eacute;s of modern sports identity: more italic, more strokes, more bevels, more chiseling. At least the star-pointed &#8220;D&#8221; that they have come up with is an interesting monogram to begin with and then adding all the accoutrements. The alternate logos are fine and will probably help move <a href=\"http:\/\/shop.nhl.com\/category\/index.jsp?categoryId=3176433\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">merchandise<\/a> for many years to come. The wordmark on its own is ridiculously italicized and every character and bevel looks distorted. Replacing the hard-to-reproduce and unappealing gold for silver\/gray was probably the best move in this whole exercise. The uniforms (below) are just about fine, I don&#8217;t really have any strong opinions. Overall, the identity is a major improvement based on what they had previously but there is absolutely nothing new here that we haven&#8217;t seen in the last five years. (More stuff to see below).<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/dallas_stars_uniform_history.jpg\" alt=\"Dallas Stars Logo, Identity, and Uniforms\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Uniform history.

We wanted our green to pop, so we went back and forth with Reebok several times. We brought in jerseys from different teams, different sports teams.<br \/><br \/>&#8220;We went back to Reebok and they found Victory Green. It was a mix between Kelly Green and Forest Green. Instead of Kelly Green having that one shade yellow too much, we needed one more shade of blue in there to bring it back. And when we did a television test, it looked unbelievable on TV. It really popped. We&#8217;ve been so dark and drab for so many years, we want this to pop. And it does.&#8221;<\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/dallas_stars_uniform.jpg\" alt=\"Dallas Stars Logo, Identity, and Uniforms\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">New uniform.
