The only reason we are talking about this is because it involves camels. Specifically the &#8220;before&#8221; camel. Look at it and tell me you don&#8217;t want to learn more? Why is it so complacent? Who is it waiting for in such relaxed repose? Is it smiling at me? Can I take it home and feed it blue food? Okay, maybe I&#8217;m getting carried away and we should just state some facts. The adorable camel is the ex-mascot of the Connecticut College Camels, the 28-team athletics department of this small liberal arts college in New London, Connecticut, with a petite student body of 1,900. The Camels compete in the NCAA Division III but are also part of the exclusive <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nescac.com\">New England Small College Athletic Conference<\/a> (NESCAC), a fact worth pointing out as it is a conference that features athletic departments with a chicken, a cow, a donkey and a polar bear as their mascots &mdash; needless to say, they are not the fiercest teams in U.S. college sports. Earlier this month, the Camels unveiled a new camel, created by sports-branding-machine <a href=\"http:\/\/home.roadrunner.com\/~rickabaugh\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rickabaugh Graphics<\/a>. (Sadly, their web site has been the same since 2006).<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>Taking this into account, the College hired Rickabaugh Graphics, whose owner Eric Rickabaugh will &#8220;redesign the camel and strengthen the school&#8217;s overall athletic identity, including its varsity letter&#8221;, according to a news story on the College&#8217;s homepage. The new camel mascot was envisioned primarily for athletic teams, and will initially be used accordingly. The current mascot, which is about ten years old, didn&#8217;t fit the athletic department&#8217;s desires for a stronger-looking, more intimidating camel. Gleaned from surveys and opinions, Rickabaugh Graphics identified the faults of the current camel: the vertical logo is difficult in horizontal layouts; the camel looks rather static, and the athletes would prefer a camel in motion; it doesn&#8217;t work on dark or complex backgrounds; and, most importantly, the connection to Connecticut College is somewhat unclear without a CC logo attached. The company also aimed to have the mascot stand out when juxtaposed with the other NESCAC logos, also proposing to change the College&#8217;s trademark royal blue color to a darker navy.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/thecollegevoice.org\/2010\/02\/08\/i-am-camel-hear-me-roar\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">An early report on the redesign, back in February<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/concoll_camels_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"Connecticut College Camels Logo, Before and After\" \/><\/p>\n<blockquote>The redesigned camel is just one aspect of a new graphic identity for varsity athletics that includes a more collegiate looking type-face, a new official &#8220;CC&#8221; monogram, and a darker blue for uniforms. The goal is to strengthen the image of Connecticut College athletics with a more unified, consistent presentation of athletics teams and communications.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/aspen.conncoll.edu\/camelweb\/alumni\/newsletter\/news\/?id1=6189&#038;uid=0&#038;nl=559658247\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press Release<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p>Without question, the new camel now perfectly fits the mold of The Angry Mascot Identity, with all the usual pieces of flair: pointy lines, shading, curved cut-off of the body, bulky typography. Bam. It&#8217;s done. We could spend days discussing the details of the camel &mdash; okay, sorry, not &#8220;could&#8221; but &#8220;will&#8221; &mdash; and the merits of the typography but the sad thing is that we could be talking about a camel, a cow, a donkey or a polar bear for any other athletic department. The recipe is so expected that it&#8217;s lost any kind of surprise. Granted, the old camel probably surprised in its doofusness, but at least it was a happy camel.<\/p>\n<object width=\"560\" height=\"340\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/8d9EFukPoBk&#038;hl=en_US&#038;fs=1&#038;\"><\/param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"><\/param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"><\/param><embed src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/8d9EFukPoBk&#038;hl=en_US&#038;fs=1&#038;\" type=\"application\/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"560\" height=\"340\"><\/embed><\/object>\n<p class=\"caption\">Unveiling the new camel.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.3x3mag.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sarah Munt<\/a> for the tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_100423_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_100423_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_100423_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_100423_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,26,87],"tags":[117,118,119,120,121],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1083"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1083"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1083\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1083"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1083"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1083"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
