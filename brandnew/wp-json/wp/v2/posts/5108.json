Rather than try to describe it poorly in a short paragraph, your best course of action will be to <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lithuania\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wikipedia it<\/a>.

That project was also designed by Vilnius, Lithuania-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.newisnew.lt\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">New!<\/a> who have now designed the new identity for the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lithuania.travel\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lithuanian State Department of Tourism<\/a>, introduced last November.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>The focus of the visual representation of the tourism brand of Lithuania is a postage stamp.

Not a good look. The new logo emphasizes the nature aspect of the country&#8230; the roller coaster wordmark is meant to represent tree branches but I mostly saw a mountain range. Google-ing &#8220;Lithuania Mountains&#8221; does show there are mountains there so either tree branches or mountains work as an interpretation. (<strong>Edit:<\/strong> I&#8217;ve been informed there are NO mountains in Lithuania). The wordmark is attractive from afar with an interesting rhythm to it but then starts to feel clunky upon closer inspection, particularly the &#8220;H&#8221; and &#8220;N&#8221;. What kills it for me is the postage stamp motif (more on that below) that makes it feel too corny.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lithuania_usb_pen.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Lithuanian State Department of Tourism by New!\" \/>\n<figcaption>USB and pen.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The new slogan and positioning is supported by the visual identity, at the centre of which is a postage stamp. A reminder of those sweet shivers we get when we receive a postcard from afar. To make our message even clearer, we&#8217;ve created additional stamps. Each one identifies a specific aspect of tourism, whether it&#8217;s nature, culture, food, outdoor activities or meeting local people.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.newisnew.lt\/lithuania-2\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">New! project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lithuania_stamps.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Lithuanian State Department of Tourism by New!\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stamps.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lithuania_stamps_arrangement.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Lithuanian State Department of Tourism by New!\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lithuania_stamps_configurations.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Lithuanian State Department of Tourism by New!\" \/>\n<figcaption>Configurations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>I can see the attraction to the postage stamp idea and the identity almost pulls it off in an interesting way but it falls short in the end, mostly due to the overly contemporary, Dribbble-esque vector illustrations that don&#8217;t speak to the history or any folkloric style unique to Lithuania. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s also a concept that could apply to any destination and is as unique to Lithuania as peanut butter is to jelly.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lithuania_stamps_photos.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Lithuanian State Department of Tourism by New!\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stamps on photos.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lithuania_stamps_stamps.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Lithuanian State Department of Tourism by New!\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stamps as stamps.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lithuania_ads.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Lithuanian State Department of Tourism by New!\" \/>\n<figcaption>Ads.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lithuania_folder.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Lithuanian State Department of Tourism by New!\" \/>\n<figcaption>Folder.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/xHU9ne-Mi7c\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Introduction to the identity and summary of most of the above.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">The applications do manage to make the concept work and with a little less stringent point of view &#8212; from, say, a tourist who just wants to visit a cool place, instead of a design blogger who just wants his opinion heard \ud83d\ude1b &#8212; this is a relatively charming, attractive, and colorful way to present Lithuania and does so definitely in a more meaningful way than the old logo could have.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established as an independent country in 1918, Lithuania &#8212; Lietuva in Lithuanian &#8212; lies in Northern Europe along the coast of the Baltic Sea.
