Offering Bachelor and Master degree courses in Business, Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering, Social Sciences and Media Studies, Electrical Engineering, and Electrical Engineering, HSB attracts a small crowd of 8,000 students and 500 faculty and staff. In June HSB introduced a new identity designed by Berlin-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kleinerundbold.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kleiner &amp; Bold<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>Perspective, reliable, inspiring and cosmopolitan &mdash; these are the emotional values, which are expressed primarily through tonality and visualization. The new design will be shaped by it, if the HSB in the future is bringing a new mark: from the simple shapes square, rectangular, and the cross, the symbol of an inclined key is created. The imagery associated with this is easily understood and used in various ways: the university as a key to education, work and success opened paths, opens up new and as a key competence. So it emphasizes its role as a driving force and connects closely with the heraldry and history of the city. The individual elements of the sign game elements also created the corporate design for different surfaces. Together with the variegation arises a friendly, open and thus perspective rich image of the university.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.kleinerundbold.com\/nc\/de\/aktuelles\/select_category\/15\/article\/bildung-die-beteiligt-prozess-design-an-der-hochschule-bremen\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kleiner &amp; Bold news page (Google-translated)<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hochschule_bremen_key.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Hochschule Bremen by Kleiner &amp; Bold\" \/>\n<figcaption>City of Bremen&#8217;s coat of arms on the left and progression to new logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hochschule_bremen_logo_detail.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Hochschule Bremen by Kleiner &amp; Bold\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>This project would have normally been posted as a Noted but it&#8217;s a slow news day and there are a couple of factors that made it appear in this column: 1) We are starting to have a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/mt_bn\/mt-search.cgi?IncludeBlogs=9&#038;limit=100&#038;search=Hochschule#.VcM0351VhBc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">nice collection of Hochschules<\/a> on Brand New and 2) The origin of the key for the new logo is clever. Let&#8217;s start with the old logo though; that is, if you can see it. Other than a blue dot, the logo is nearly invisible with its thin Copperplate Gothic wordmark and hairline half egg line that probably means unity or something. The new logo has much more meaning, being derived from the key in the city&#8217;s coat of arms and abstracted through very simple geometric forms. Aside from its source, the concepts that lead out from a key are optimistic and uplifting (as mentioned in the quote above). I also like the secondary graphic of the &#8220;X&#8221; which, if you are optimistic, can be read as &#8220;X marks the spot, so come study here&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>While the icon is good, the lock-up above does not make the best use of it. It ends up looking large and clunky against the bland typography and on their website, where the the lock-up is a small icon and large typography, the type looks clunky. The fault might be in the font choice and setting it in full-on black, making the two elements feel like they belong to two separate identities. I could also do without the gradient on the icon.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hochschule_bremen_stationery_and_tablets.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Hochschule Bremen by Kleiner &amp; Bold\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stationery and digital.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hochschule_bremen_catalog_covers.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Hochschule Bremen by Kleiner &amp; Bold\" \/>\n<figcaption>Catalog covers.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hochschule_bremen_posters.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Hochschule Bremen by Kleiner &amp; Bold\" \/>\n<figcaption>Posters.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hochschule_bremen_tshirts.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Hochschule Bremen by Kleiner &amp; Bold\" \/>\n<figcaption>T-shirts.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">Speaking of gradients, the applications are far too gradient-driven but I&#8217;ll admit that the posters look kind of cool with all those shades going on. (In the posters there is a third lock-up that may be the best and the 1-color application brings out the best in the logo). There is a slab serif in use that&#8217;s attractive on its own but feels rather arbitrary in contrast to the logo. Overall, there are a few good seeds here for an interesting identity but it might benefit from some added (or subtracted) simplicity.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1982, Hochschule Bremen (Bremen University of Applied Sciences in English and HSB for short) is the result of a merger of four universities in the city of Bremen in Germany.
