Originating in Barcelona, Spain, and founded by <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hectorayu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">H\u00e9ctor Ayuso<\/a>, OFFF has been celebrated annually in its hometown and has expanded (and contracted) to various cities over the years, as OFFF on Tour, including New York, Mexico City, and Tel-Aviv. In preparation for the 2019 edition in Barcelona, OFFF has introduced a new identity designed by local firm <a href=\"https:\/\/www.crowd-studio.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Crowd Studio<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>Over the past few years, we have noticed an overall shift in the brand&#8217;s identity. OFFF, the brand proving itself with the concept of having no brief and giving the complete freedom plus the invitation to create, this also had its consequence. We noticed that with so many openness, the brand unfortunately lost its visual presence and visual aspect throughout the Festival, online and onsite.<\/blockquote><h3>OFFF Festival provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/offf_approach.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for OFFF by Crowd Studio\" \/>\n<figcaption>Overall approach to restructuring the identity.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The OFFF icon has finally become visually recognised by everyone, so it became unnecessary to conserve the 3 &#8220;FFF&#8221; in the logo. The OFFF icon is now visually abstract, simplified and more compact thanks to re-thickness of the symbols.<\/blockquote><h3>OFFF Festival provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/offf_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for OFFF by Crowd Studio\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/offf_logo_colors.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for OFFF by Crowd Studio\" \/>\n<figcaption>Color variations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo lacked finesse but it did manage to represent the multiple &#8220;F&#8221;s from the name, perhaps a little ambiguously but given that the audience is dominantly of the creative kind they would get it. The new logo builds on the recognizability of the old logo &#8212; although, more than that, it builds on the recognizability of the OFFF name &#8212; to create an abstract icon of a circle and a chevron-esque diamond. In terms of an evolution I guess it&#8217;s fine but I think I miss the effort of building so many &#8220;F&#8221;s into a logo. Given the wonkiness of the old logo, I do realize that that&#8217;s not an easy thing but I&#8217;m sure it would be doable. The new logo is certainly more functional and works well to easily and quickly be recognized as OFFF.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/offf_typography_01.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for OFFF by Crowd Studio\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/offf_typography_02.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for OFFF by Crowd Studio\" \/>\n<figcaption>Typography (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.myfonts.com\/fonts\/letter-omega\/neufile-grotesk\/?refby=ucllc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Neufile Grotesk<\/a>).<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>With this new approach we are adding more control to the brand use, where the brand gets more identified with the ability to adapt to other contents therefore the Festival becomes more firm and more strengthened.<\/blockquote><h3>OFFF Festival provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/offf_communications_structure.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for OFFF by Crowd Studio\" \/>\n<figcaption>Communications structure.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/offf_program.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for OFFF by Crowd Studio\" \/>\n<figcaption>Program.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/offf_wristbands.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for OFFF by Crowd Studio\" \/>\n<figcaption>Wristbands.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/offf_website.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for OFFF by Crowd Studio\" \/>\n<figcaption>Website.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/offf_banners_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for OFFF by Crowd Studio\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/offf_banners_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for OFFF by Crowd Studio\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/offf_banners_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for OFFF by Crowd Studio\" \/>\n<figcaption>Various formats to present speakers and information.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>I&#8217;m not familiar with past identities or materials so I don&#8217;t have anything to contrast against but I get the point that this new approach is a way to bring some cohesiveness to what was probably a rather loose and inconsistent system. There is nothing overly surprising or engaging here&#8230; simply a sturdy grid system that better allows to highlight the content of the festival in what appears to be a more grown-up way.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/293882201?title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"360\" height=\"203\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>New identity presentation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">In motion, the identity is a little more interesting and engaging and, in principle, it&#8217;s all fine but I wonder if there needed to be something a little wilder somewhere, somehow, as a reminder of OFFF&#8217;s vibe and creative rebelliousness.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 2001 (originally as Online Flash Film Festival), OFFF is one of the most well-known design and creativity festivals.
