Basically they are a charity for charities. NCVO connects its 11,000 member organizations with people, partners, and resources; it represents represent them to government; and identifies the best knowledge and expertise in the sector. In April, NCVO <a href=\"http:\/\/www.civilsociety.co.uk\/fundraising\/news\/content\/19420\/ncvo_launches_new_brand_design_with_focus_on_volunteering\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">introduced<\/a> a new identity designed by London-based <a href=\"http:\/\/multiadaptor.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MultiAdaptor<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>Our research surfaced a key insight, which highlighted that NCVO tended to be perceived as passive rather than active within the sector. Our idea was to transform them into a proactive voice within both the voluntary industry and the public eye. We activated the &#8216;V&#8217; to  become an &#8216;amplifier&#8217;, creating a more dynamic strapline treatment in the process. An overarching visual style using the the angle of the V helped to then tie communications together with a distinct look, while still being flexible.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/multiadaptor.com\/ncvobranding\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MultiAdaptor project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ncvo_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for NCVO by MultiAdaptor\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo with tagline.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ncvo_logo_construction.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for NCVO by MultiAdaptor\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo grid.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo had good intentions with its cluster of blobs that looked like a comic-book dream bubble and also hinted at bringing together different entities. Even the typography was sort of okay, despite that &#8220;N&#8221;. The new logo, at first, looks quite odd with the &#8220;V&#8221; going on a piggyback ride with the &#8220;O&#8221; but once you see it in action with the tagline (and other verbal branding) it&#8217;s a clever, intriguing logo that takes on the role of a handheld loudspeaker. I wish they would have left the character shapes alone instead of making all the inconsistent rounded-corner, pointy-corner, blunt-corner modifications. I understand that it softens the wordmark but at least choose one approach, not three. Nonetheless and especially when it&#8217;s used small, the logo looks and works great.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ncvo_business_cards.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for NCVO by MultiAdaptor\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ncvo_materials.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for NCVO by MultiAdaptor\" \/>\n<figcaption>A few different materials.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ncvo_buttons.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for NCVO by MultiAdaptor\" \/>\n<figcaption>Pins.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ncvo_totes.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for NCVO by MultiAdaptor\" \/>\n<figcaption>Totes.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ncvo_pencil.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for NCVO by MultiAdaptor\" \/>\n<figcaption>Pencil.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/132452557?color=ffffff&#038;title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Identity introduction. Some of the same stuff as above plus a few more applications, but set to some encouraging drumming.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">In application, they have made a strong use of the angles, which make all the applications stand out, from the business cards to the totes to, my favorite, the prototype pencil where the tagline ends parallel to the shape and the wordmark is at an angle, flipping the structure of the rest of the applications. Overall, a dynamic and engaging identity for an organization that is all about galvanizing others.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1919, NCVO (National Council for Voluntary Organisations) &quot;champions the voluntary sector and volunteering&quot; in England, by connecting, representing, and supporting voluntary organizations, from the smallest community groups to the largest charities.
