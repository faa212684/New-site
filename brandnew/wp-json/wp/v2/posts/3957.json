The boxed set contains eight individual sets each designed around a woman&#8217;s name derived from CHARISMA: C for Camellia, H for Hilary, A for Aurora, R for Ross, I for Isabelle, S for Salomi, M for Mona, and A for Audrey. While this is not a real identity or consumer packaging, any of the eight sets is beautiful enough to be a Friday Like of its own, whether it&#8217;s the colorful paper combinations of Hilary, the filled-with-a-rainbow black boxes of Aurora, or the foil-stamped blobs on Salomi. A really stunning piece of design(s). <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/22350365\/Project-Charisma-Full-Version\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project here<\/strong><\/a><\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">One Roaster One Quality by Studio Plat<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_oroq.jpg\" alt=\"One Roaster One Quality by Studio Plat\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">If my Korean is up to par (or if Google Translate is doing its job correctly) this is what I understand: One Roaster One Quality is a house brand of coffee for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gratefulground.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Grateful Ground<\/a>, a caf&eacute; and garden in Seoul, South Korea. Designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.studioplat.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Studio Plat<\/a>, what got me about this project was the OROQ shorthand version of the logo where the &#8220;O&#8221;s and bowls of the &#8220;R&#8221; and &#8220;Q&#8221; are all the same height, with the stem and leg of the &#8220;R&#8221; and the tail of the &#8220;Q&#8221; shooting under the baseline. The &#8220;Q&#8221; on its own is great. The packaging is fairly straightforward with the design applied as a rubber stamp (or at least it looks that way) and the kraft paper is nicely offset with some white labels where each coffee flavor has its own pattern. For those about to OROQ, we salute you! <strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.studioplat.com\/OROQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Simon Pengelly by Spin<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_pengelly.jpg\" alt=\"Simon Pengelly by Spin\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/simonpengelly.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Simon Pengelly<\/a> is a furniture designer in London who makes beautiful wood objects and it was the lines in one of his chairs that triggered his identity, designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/spin.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Spin<\/a>. Hinting at long slabs of plywood, the logo is a &#8220;P&#8221; monogram that can be rendered as simply as using two sticks or as &#8220;elaborately&#8221; as 16. (I put elaborately in quotes since the simplicity of the 16-stick version is still killer but it&#8217;s relatively Baroque in contrast to the primary monogram). The earthy wood tones are offset by an emergency-like red\/orange color that makes for some of coolest packing tape in the business. <a href=\"http:\/\/spin.co.uk\/work\/simon-pengelly\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"There is literally a little bit of everything today (and that&apos;s just in the first Friday Like) for everyone this week with work from Hong Kong, Seoul, and London&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[597,873,53,568],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3957"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3957"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3957\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3957"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3957"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3957"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
