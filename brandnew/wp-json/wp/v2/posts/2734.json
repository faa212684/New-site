YP claims a &#8220;top-40 web domain in the U.S.&#8221; according to comScore, its website and app receive a combined total of 50 million monthly visitors, and three calls are made every second from its app to listed businesses.

It does away with the app icon approach of the previous one and all it does is spell out the name in simple, bold sans serif with a yellow underline. A roller coaster ride of graphic excitement it is not. But it is competently done, spaced, and deployed. With large clients sometimes that&#8217;s enough of a victory. The simplicity of the logo also helps set up the mood and tone of the advertising and application. Everything is clean and straightforward.<\/p>\n<blockquote>Clean, bold, typography within the brand system makes headlines quick and easy to read. Refined and focused use of yellow &mdash; a color that was previously used gratuitously as a signature cue &mdash; now points the way to useful information or highlights a result. A brisk, direct, brand voice brings refreshing personality to headlines while swiftly and succinctly delivering only what the reader needs to know.<\/blockquote><h3>Provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/73350440?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=fad102\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Brand video.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/yellow_pages_2013_07_ad_hotdog.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for YP by Interbrand\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/yellow_pages_2013_08_ad_bike.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for YP by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Outdoor advertising.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/yellow_pages_2013_10_subway_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for YP by Interbrand\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/yellow_pages_2013_11_subway_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for YP by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Subway advertising.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/yellow_pages_2013_12_tote.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for YP by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Tote.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">In application and advertising it&#8217;s all about emphasizing clarity and directness, something a user might want when attempting to use a yellow-paged directory &mdash; although, to be honest, it makes me wonder who all these 50-million-people-a-month are that are using the yellow pages; it&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m a barometer of anything but I haven&#8217;t used a directory like this in ages.
