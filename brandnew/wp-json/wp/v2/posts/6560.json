Their goal is to help everyone reach their full potential, working with three primary groups: young people aged 16-24, providing them programs to make them ready for the workplace as well as internships and apprenticeships; women of all ages, partnering with them to build confidence and skills; and children ages 2 to 4, with their Gateway Tots program. Recently, to strengthen their reputation and build brand perception, City Gateway introduced a new identity designed by London-based <a href=\"http:\/\/paulbelford.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Paul Belford Ltd<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>The brief was to create an identity that would bring City Gateway&#8217;s services to life in print and online, dramatising a vision to create &#8216;a society where everyone can achieve their full potential&#8217;. A unique challenge was the diversity of the charity&#8217;s different audience groups, including young people (aged 19-24), local women and mothers, corporate organisations, funders, community referral partners and individual givers.<br \/><br  \/>The logo developed by the award-winning studio uses typography to tell the story of the charity&#8217;s role in society. It features two &#8216;y&#8217;s that represent the different paths a person might take in life. Together they create a line that demonstrates how City Gateway helps individuals to stay on the path to realising their true potential. The trajectory points upward and forwards, symbolising opportunity.<\/blockquote><h3>Paul Belford Ltd. provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/city_gateway_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for City Gateway by Paul Belford Ltd\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/city_gateway_logo_animation.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for City Gateway by Paul Belford Ltd\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo animation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p><strike>The old logo wasn&#8217;t good but it wasn&#8217;t terrible either for what was clearly an effort done without the help of a professional graphic designer. The type and icon were clunky but it had the right message of providing direction in a tough city.<\/strike> [Update: I was sent the correct before logo and that one <em>was<\/em> terrible. Here is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/city_gateway_logo_before_after.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the original<\/a> I posted.] The new logo isn&#8217;t as clear in its concept (unless you see the animation) but it does hint at following a path with the &#8220;y&#8221;s establishing a clear visual line and a sense of consistency and repetition (which, as boring as they sound, are key elements of being a reliable person in society). The new logo now looks more professional and gives the charity a much more sophisticated and put-together presence that will help with their fundraising efforts. At times, in the applications, it feels like something should happen after the lone slash in the third line; like it&#8217;s begging for a sub-brand.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/city_gateway_typeface_a.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for City Gateway by Paul Belford Ltd\" \/>\n<figcaption>Typography.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/city_gateway_colors_a.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for City Gateway by Paul Belford Ltd\" \/>\n<figcaption>Color palette.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>This same angle plays a wider role across City Gateway materials to create a nuanced brand language. It can be seen in the use of angled type, rotated imagery and asymmetrical grid structures. In other applications, there is also balance to this playfulness where a straighter, more serious approach can be seen.<br \/><br \/>The brand colour is orange (Pantone Orange 021), selected for its ability to represent different meanings across City Gateway&#8217;s services, including warmth and optimism. These areas are further differentiated by the use of a secondary colour palette that adds versatility.<\/blockquote><h3>Paul Belford Ltd. provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/city_gateway_business_cards.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for City Gateway by Paul Belford Ltd\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/city_gateway_booklet.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for City Gateway by Paul Belford Ltd\" \/>\n<figcaption>Booklet.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/city_gateway_leaflets.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for City Gateway by Paul Belford Ltd\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/city_gateway_leaflets_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for City Gateway by Paul Belford Ltd\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/city_gateway_leaflets_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for City Gateway by Paul Belford Ltd\" \/>\n<figcaption>Leaflets.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The applications make a strong statement with the rotated photos or text that match the angle of the logo.
