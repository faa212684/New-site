Its mission is threefold: to welcome and inform visitors, to promote Paris as a destination to the rest of France and abroad, and to support businesses and conferences\/events to do their thing in Paris. The organization maintains six tourism offices, prints over a million copies of the city&#8217;s official map, and maintains the city pass program, among other activities. The Paris Convention and Visitors Bureau recently introduced a new identity designed by Paris- and Lyon-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.grapheine.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Graph\u00e9ine<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/paris_tourisme_question.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Paris Convention and Visitors Bureau by Graph\u00e9ine\" \/>\n<figcaption>The task at hand.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>Using or not the symbol of the Eiffel Tower was our first question. Difficult to do without the great lady, to communicate effectively about the destination &#8220;Paris&#8221; to an international audience. However, we were aware of entering a visual territory particularly used and where the kitsch border is very close. We went for simplicity, and concentrated our efforts on a typographic design that can be seen as a Parisian skyline, the drawing of the &#8220;A&#8221; directly evoking the Eiffel Tower. The result is a minimalist typogram.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.grapheine.com\/en\/branding-en\/paris-convention-and-visitors-bureau-rebranding\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Graph\u00e9ine project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/paris_tourisme_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Paris Convention and Visitors Bureau by Graph\u00e9ine\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo was pretty nice with its &#8220;City of Lights&#8221;-influenced representation of the Eiffel Tower. The typography could have been a little more interesting (or at least given more space to breathe) but it was okay too. I love that Graph\u00e9ine even thought about NOT including the Eiffel Tower in an official Paris tourism logo &#8212; it&#8217;s like an NBA team logo without a basketball, a Canadian logo without a maple leaf, or an Australian logo without the shape of the continent. But questioning its need led to a magnificent logo that is unmistakably Eiffel-Tower-esque but without being literal about it and without the cheesiness of all the logos shown at the beginning of the post.<\/p>\n<p>I love the openness of the wordmark as it expands the visual area of such a small word and it lets each of the letterforms sink in, especially the &#8220;A&#8221; that doubles as the Eiffel Tower. This is as elegant a solution as you will get, particularly in the tourism industry. I&#8217;m still not sure why the tittle of the &#8220;i&#8221; is so high&#8230; I personally read it as the moon, high in the sky. To me, this is one of the best destination logos we&#8217;ve seen in a while: it&#8217;s meaningful, it&#8217;s location specific, and it&#8217;s perfectly crafted.<\/p>\n<p>By the way, the old logo doesn&#8217;t fully go away; it&#8217;s still visible in the website and some of the applications below. I guess it&#8217;s the equivalent of the old logo being PepsiCo (the parent company) and the new logo being Pepsi (the consumer brand).<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/paris_tourisme_office_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Paris Convention and Visitors Bureau by Graph\u00e9ine\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/paris_tourisme_office_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Paris Convention and Visitors Bureau by Graph\u00e9ine\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/paris_tourisme_office_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Paris Convention and Visitors Bureau by Graph\u00e9ine\" \/>\n<figcaption>One of six physical offices.

It contains the iconography and becomes a window on &#8220;Paris&#8221;. This frame invites the eye to travel between letters, titles and images, creating curiosity.<br \/><br \/>We also wanted to invite an illustrator to work with us on iconography. It was the perfect opportunity to collaborate with S\u00e9verin Millet, Lyon-based illustrator, whose simple and colorful work perfectly matches with our vision of the project. Going for illustration allowed us to step aside from the usual postcard pictures of Paris, and to offer a fresh, colorful and poetic look of the capital.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.grapheine.com\/en\/branding-en\/paris-convention-and-visitors-bureau-rebranding\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Graph\u00e9ine project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/paris_tourisme_editorial_approach.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Paris Convention and Visitors Bureau by Graph\u00e9ine\" \/>\n<figcaption>Editorial approach.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>In application, the logo turns into an extended logo-as-window device that breaks from the standard use by being affixed to a larger area that includes lively, colorful illustrations by Lyon-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.severinmillet.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">S\u00e9verin Millet<\/a>.

Overall, this sets the bar for major metropolis destination branding, from logo to applications, in a way that makes the city feel welcoming, friendly, and accessible but also conveys that someone is making a concerted effort to make it look that way and treating the tourism office as serious business.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1971, the Paris Convention and Visitors Bureau is the official tourism organization for the city of Paris (which needs no introduction).
