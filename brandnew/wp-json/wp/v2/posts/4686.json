One of its specialties is providing hotspots in &#8220;closed, temporary, or transitory spaces&#8221; like hotels, which landed them a contract with the company that manages all airports in Spain. While the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.eurona.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">corporate site<\/a> still has the old logo, the new identity designed by Alicante, Spain-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wearesmall.es\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Small<\/a> has begun rolling out to consumers.<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/eurona_logo_before_all.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Eurona by Small\" \/>\n<figcaption>All before logos.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/eurona_process.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Eurona by Small\" \/>\n<figcaption>Process and reference sources.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The previous symbol referred back to the physical waves, to its origin as a trademark. Was it worth today? The answer was obvious, no.<br \/><br \/>But that was the catapult inspiration for the new brand. Waves today should not be measured in hertz, but smiles, laughter, memories, travel, moments, sharing, belonging&#8230; emotion, pure emotion. So those airwaves, should send all those emotions in the air and we were supposed to be the vehicle to take them to their destination. And we look at our world of graphic inspiration, roots. Eurona roots, the place where he was born, Barcelona. Modern, vivid, colorful. As for the brand message should also be emotional. Emotional and Universal. Internet should no longer be a privilege but a right. And our services and rates support it.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.wearesmall.es\/portfolio\/eurona\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Small project page (Google translated)<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/eurona_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Eurona by Small\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo was bad but perhaps not surprisingly so. Communication airwaves rendered as swooshes representing WiFi and cell phone connectivity is the obvious solution and some companies don&#8217;t know any better (or aren&#8217;t offered any better). The new logo manages to keep a similar structure and concept but both are infinitely better resolved. The new wordmark stays all lowercase and relatively as a geometric sans serif with curvy spurs\/slabs added. I mostly like it except for the &#8220;a&#8221;, there is something unresolved about it. At first the &#8220;n&#8221; irked me but I like how it nestles the new emanating &#8220;airwaves&#8221; in the form of abstract icons. The plus sign is maybe too forced on top of the &#8220;o&#8221;&#8230; come to think of it, I have one too many &#8220;but&#8221;s or &#8220;if&#8221;s about the logo. Still, there is something appealing about it and it gets more engaging in application.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/eurona_colors.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Eurona by Small\" \/>\n<figcaption>Color palette.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/eurona_logo_animation.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Eurona by Small\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo with animated icons.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/eurona_icons_grid.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Eurona by Small\" \/>\n<figcaption>&#8220;o&#8221; with emanating icons.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The main trick of the logo is that it can expand its radius of airwaves with an extended range of icons that builds outwards from the &#8220;o&#8221;. It&#8217;s a clever and relatively novel way of exploiting the &#8220;Let&#8217;s do a ton of icons because it&#8217;s fun&#8221; trend and giving them purpose.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/eurona_business_cards.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Eurona by Small\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business card.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/eurona_folder_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Eurona by Small\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/eurona_folder_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Eurona by Small\" \/>\n<figcaption>Folder.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/eurona_guidelines_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Eurona by Small\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/eurona_guidelines_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Eurona by Small\" \/>\n<figcaption>Guidelines.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/eurona_packaging.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Eurona by Small\" \/>\n<figcaption>Packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/eurona_sim_card.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Eurona by Small\" \/>\n<figcaption>SIM card.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/eurona_ad.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Eurona by Small\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/eurona_ad_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Eurona by Small\" \/>\n<figcaption>Ads.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">In application the &#8220;o&#8221; with icons device looks great when it&#8217;s on its own as in the back of the business card and the logo works best when it has only the few fizzy icons coming out. In places like the folder where the logo is small and has the full range of icons, it loses some of its impact. Somewhere in between are the examples (ads) where the icons start emanating from the device pictured and flow up into the logo &#8212; starts to get a little cheesy, but passable. The complementary typography, especially the kind in stacked blocks, feels forced and speaks a different, less friendly visual language than the logo and icons. Overall, without having access to seeing the old look in application, I&#8217;m pretty sure it&#8217;s significantly better. The identity feels telecom-y, which is both good and bad but at least now it feels like 2010s telecom-y.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 2001, Eurona is a telecommunications company in Spain that originally started as a network engineering firm and in 2006 began acting as the operator of those networks, offering internet access and WiFi hotspot connectivity in 10 countries, with&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,26,89],"tags":[617,992,395,905],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4686"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4686"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4686\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4686"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4686"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4686"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
