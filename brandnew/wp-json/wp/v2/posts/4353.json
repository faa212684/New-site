Named after <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Charlemagne\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Charles the Great<\/a>, KdG has a small and quirky mix of areas of study, including business management, bio-chemical engineering projects, and research in art and design. Earlier this month, the university introduced a new identity designed by Mechelen, Belgium-based <a href=\"http:\/\/brandingtoday.be\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Branding Today<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/karel_de_grote_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Karel de Grote Hogeschool by Branding Today\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Somewhere in the extra large, default-looking typesetting of the old logo there was a glimmer of something decent in the form of the square KdG monogram set on a thin cross but it was too small to be noticed. The new logo does away completely with the old and introduces a language of sticks and circles &mdash; reminiscent of the new <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/new_logo_and_identity_for_museum_of_contemporary_art_chicago_by_mevis_van_deursen.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MCA Chicago work<\/a> &mdash; and slightly-off angles. The resulting logo is very unexpected for either a Catholic university or any university and, in its weirdness, it becomes a rather cool mark, paired with a more serious sans serif that grounds it in reality.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/JnHCATO0KaI\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>New logo introduction.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The main application to see the logo is in the video above, which conveys the attitude and behavior of both the logo and typography. It&#8217;s snappy! Below are some excerpt screenshots of the prototypes shown in the video.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/karel_de_grote_stationery.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Karel de Grote Hogeschool by Branding Today\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stationery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/karel_de_grote_ad.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Karel de Grote Hogeschool by Branding Today\" \/>\n<figcaption>Print ad.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/karel_de_grote_banner_id.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Karel de Grote Hogeschool by Branding Today\" \/>\n<figcaption>Banners and ID (not to scale).<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/karel_de_grote_campus.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Karel de Grote Hogeschool by Branding Today\" \/>\n<figcaption>New campus (2016) rendering.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">The most important aspect of the identity is that it gives a clear visual voice to the university, whereas before it was mostly generic and forgettable. If you didn&#8217;t like the MCA Chicago stuff there is a chance you might like the more tempered approach of this one or it might extend your dislike for this ugly-geometric approach. The full font &mdash; most noticeable in the print ad &mdash; isn&#8217;t that great unfortunately in large doses and the exaggerated kicks in the &#8220;l&#8221;s, &#8220;i&#8221;s, and &#8220;t&#8221;s are very off-putting but the approach to layouts with the angled blocks seems promising. Overall, there is a cool seed planted by the logo but the rest of the identity still needs some time and a few rounds of actual applications to flourish.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1994 with the merger of 13 Catholic university colleges in Antwerp, Belgium, Karel de Grote Hogeschool (KdG) is a Catholic university offering bachelor, master, and postgraduate degrees to more than 13,000 students.
