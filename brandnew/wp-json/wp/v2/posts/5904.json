Telemadrid is part of Radio Televisi\u00f3n Madrid, which also broadcasts La Otra (&#8220;The Other&#8221;), launched in 2001 as a sister channel, and Onda Madrid (&#8220;Madrid Wave&#8221;), a radio channel. Recently, Telemadrid and all accompanying entities introduced a new identity designed by the Barcelona office of <a href=\"http:\/\/wearemucho.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mucho<\/a> and motion graphics by <a href=\"http:\/\/comodoscreen.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">C\u00f3modo Screen<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>In the new visual language, the three brands within the group all have the star in common, but each one has it own personality. The one for TeleMadrid brings the people of Madrid together (the arrows point to the centre). The star of LaOtra reflects its young and dynamic nature. OndaMadrid is expansive and spreads out (like pulsing waves). As each has its own symbol they also work perfectly as the on-screen watermark logos.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/wearemucho.com\/project\/telemadrid\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mucho project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/telemadrid_logo_before_after_all.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and On-air Graphics for Telemadrid by Mucho and C\u00f3modo Screen\" \/>\n<figcaption>All logos, before and after.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/235014524?color=daffe5&#038;title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"775\" height=\"436\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>The three logos.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/236900056?color=daffe5&#038;title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"775\" height=\"436\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Animating from one star to the other.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/telemadrid_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and On-air Graphics for Telemadrid by Mucho and C\u00f3modo Screen\" \/>\n<figcaption>Telemadrid logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The evolution of the star is subtle &#8212; keeping the equity of the original and appeasing any change-averse segment of the audience &#8212; but it yields a much more interesting silhouette for the icon in the style of 1950s &#8211; 60s corporate identity. The move to three different stars for each of the channels is relatively daring in that the organizations risks losing that instant connection that easily existed before but it&#8217;s commendable they adopted it and I think it makes the family of channels more engaging by each having a distinct expression but unified by a single color and improved typography. The old wordmarks were like really lame rave flyer typography and didn&#8217;t quite hint at the gravitas of the channels. The new wordmarks, set in Klim Type Foundry&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/klim.co.nz\/retail-fonts\/tiempos-text\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tiempos<\/a> are stately, elegant, and still manage a contemporary feel.<\/p>\n<p>The animations between the three logos are probably never going to be seen by the audience but for a bunch of designers, staring at their screens, they are pretty fun to look at. They also probably helped convince the client that there was synergy between the three different stars.<\/p>\n<blockquote>The way the colours are used has also been changed. They move from the star to the background which brings more variety and colour. The 8 new colours have qualities that enhance their specific uses on-screen which makes them more topical. The red, which is used when only a single colour can be applied, is the red of the Community of Madrid.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/wearemucho.com\/project\/telemadrid\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mucho project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/telemadrid_logo_colors.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and On-air Graphics for Telemadrid by Mucho and C\u00f3modo Screen\" \/>\n<figcaption>Color palette.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The visual language of the network starts with the star. However, it is the polygons that form the star in negative, as well as the flat colours, that give this language its voice through a system that is both vibrant and simple. Animations twist or turn the shapes, zoom in on parts of them, or change their positions. This creates a language that is virtually limitless but, at the same time, still easy to recognise.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/wearemucho.com\/project\/telemadrid\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mucho project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/telemadrid_star.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and On-air Graphics for Telemadrid by Mucho and C\u00f3modo Screen\" \/>\n<figcaption>Star graphic.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/telemadrid_business_cards.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and On-air Graphics for Telemadrid by Mucho and C\u00f3modo Screen\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/telemadrid_postcards.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and On-air Graphics for Telemadrid by Mucho and C\u00f3modo Screen\" \/>\n<figcaption>Postcards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/telemadrid_billboard.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and On-air Graphics for Telemadrid by Mucho and C\u00f3modo Screen\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/telemadrid_billboard_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and On-air Graphics for Telemadrid by Mucho and C\u00f3modo Screen\" \/>\n<figcaption>Outdoor ads.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The few applications shown are decent&#8230; a little shy and tame but probably just a case of most of these being proof of concept. The business cards do look quite nice, especially with the full star graphic in the back. The outdoor ads also show the potential of the star graphic to serve as a flexible device to frame content and text while adding strong bands of color that would make the ads hard to ignore.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/telemadrid_logo_la_otra.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and On-air Graphics for Telemadrid by Mucho and C\u00f3modo Screen\" \/>\n<figcaption>La Otra logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/telemadrid_la_otra_badges.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and On-air Graphics for Telemadrid by Mucho and C\u00f3modo Screen\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/telemadrid_la_otra_newspaper.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and On-air Graphics for Telemadrid by Mucho and C\u00f3modo Screen\" \/>\n<figcaption>La Otra materials.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The La Otra materials work within the same structure but add patterns into the mix for a more extroverted look.

(D for effort on that mock-up.)<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>There are a couple more radio applications on the Mucho site but not that more interesting than the sad mic above. It&#8217;s radio, though, so no one sees it. (That was sarcasm.)<\/p>\n<blockquote>The audio-branding, created by Banjo Music, is a succinct soundscape. It simply and fondly evokes the acoustic character of Madrid: the &#8216;chotis&#8217; and the street organ. These distinctive sounds and melodies have been reworked to make them more contemporary giving the audio-branding a memorable and familiar feel.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/wearemucho.com\/project\/telemadrid\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mucho project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/235015138?color=daffe5&#038;title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"775\" height=\"436\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo idents and a showcase of all the audio branding by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/banjomusic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Banjo Music<\/a>.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/235017399?color=daffe5&#038;title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"775\" height=\"436\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>On-air package.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">The on-air graphics are pretty great.
