(The average NBA arena holds 20,000 people). The church offers various services beyond the weekly service, including groups for kids and teenagers, missions, baptisms (more than 6,500 last year), and a 2-year college education. NewSpring Church is not your parents&#8217; church by any means: football-arena-sized screens project the service, led most notably by jeans-wearing senior pastor (and founder) <a href=\"http:\/\/perrynoble.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Perry Noble<\/a>, and punctuated by festival-quality musical acts. This month, NewSpring introduced a new identity designed by its <a href=\"https:\/\/newspring.cc\/jobs\/creative-team\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">in-house creative team.<\/a><\/p><!--more--><p><strong>I will say this upfront: please be respectful in the comments.

It wasn&#8217;t original or anything either. Given what they had to work with, the creative team had done a good job in creating an engaging system revolving around the bright green color, some splashes of handwritten typography, and overall proper execution.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/newspring_church_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for NewSpring Church done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/newspring_church_logo_tomb.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for NewSpring Church done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>&#8220;n&#8221; shown over the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Empty_tomb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Empty Tomb<\/a> (of Jesus).<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The new logo isn&#8217;t that original either. We&#8217;ve all seen the teardrop shape a hundred and twelve times &mdash; and that&#8217;s on one Sunday alone. However, it&#8217;s not something you see on a church everyday and in this context, it&#8217;s a remarkably novel approach. The lowercase &#8220;n&#8221; is meant to convey the entrance to Jesus&#8217; Empty Tomb in Jerusalem. It&#8217;s a great concept to tell but, yeah, it&#8217;s a stretch. And I don&#8217;t mean that in a jerk way, you could pretty much put any letter over that shape and make it somehow fit. (Okay, perhaps not any of the V, W, X, Y, and Zs). What I do like about the &#8220;n&#8221; is that it counters the holding teardrop shape with a sharp corner of its own. It&#8217;s a small detail but it helps sell the monogram (to me at least).<\/p>\n<p>Another element that makes the logo (and identity) work is the choice of Process Type Foundry&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/processtypefoundry.com\/fonts\/colfax\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Colfax<\/a> type family which, as PTF rightfully (and much better than me) describes, is a &#8220;refined oval sans serif of 20th century origins and 21st century sensibilities&#8221;. It&#8217;s a beautifully crafted, strong sans serif that has a very peculiar aesthetic that gives all of NewSpring&#8217;s materials a solid, confident visual language.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/newspring_church_collateral.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for NewSpring Church done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Various collateral.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/newspring_church_card.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for NewSpring Church done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Notecard.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/newspring_church_bulletin.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for NewSpring Church done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Bulletin (with pen).<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/newspring_church_nametag.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for NewSpring Church done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Nametag.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/newspring_church_sign.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for NewSpring Church done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Exterior sign.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/newspring_church_service.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for NewSpring Church done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Service.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/newspring_church_tshirt.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for NewSpring Church done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>T-shirt.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/104306629?color=c60c30\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Redesign process. <\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">I am not a fan of the teardrop shape by any standard but of all the attempts at adopting it as an identity element &mdash; beyond Duffy &amp; Partners&#8217; Bahamas identity &mdash; this is one of the most convincing and successful executions. I really like the placement of the &#8220;n&#8221; monogram on the lower right corner, taking advantage of the holding shape. (A nightmare for printers, though!). I have been fascinated by the efforts churches make to appear more accessible, younger, hipper, more consume-able, and I think NewSpring and its creative team have found that balance between trying to be cool and actually being cool. Case in point: check their <a href=\"https:\/\/newspring.cc\/annualreport\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">annual report<\/a> &mdash; this is on par with other online annual reports from companies like Kickstarter or MailChimp. Overall, there is a tremendous amount of work that has gone into this identity and its deployment to the tens of thousands of people who interact with it, and it&#8217;s a great example of an in-house team&#8217;s positive impact.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 2000, NewSpring Church is a Baptist Christian &#8220;megachurch&#8221; &mdash; a moniker assigned to churches with at least 2,000 people in average weekend attendance &mdash; with ten locations in South Carolina and 27,000 people attending each weekend.
