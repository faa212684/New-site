One of the most treaded color preconceptions is that oranges and reds make you hungry and here you can see it in action. Look at the green and black and white image of the old look and compare it with the image directly above. It&#8217;s like night and day. The new design looks more like an actual restaurant identity than simply the logo that accompanies a new app or San Francisco start-up. This is thought-out, considerate, and very well designed. The only thing I don&#8217;t understand that is driving me a little crazy is why &#8220;MUNCHERY&#8221; is not centered with the &#8220;M&#8221;.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/munchery_01_all.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Munchery done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Munchery explained.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>Our new containers are microwave AND oven safe. Made from renewable and sustainably sourced plant fibers (bamboo &#038; sugarcane mix). And they&#8217;re compostable and biodegradable.<br \/><br \/>We tried to get away from plastic as much as possible, but couldn&#8217;t find a good solution for container lids. So we moved to plastic lids that are made entirely of recycled plastic bottles, and 100% recyclable.<br \/><br \/>To bring it all together is the lovely, colorful sleeve. It provides key structural support and allows our lids and containers to work together at 100%. They are made from sustainably sourced, non-virgin paper that is SFI &amp; FSC certified. Same with our bags.<br \/><br \/>As you can see, responsibility was a big focus as part of this relaunch. So on a related note, we also partnered with The Conservation Fund to offset our delivery drivers carbon footprint by planting trees. We also partnered with The San Francisco Food Bank and donate a meal for every order placed on Munchery.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.thedieline.com\/blog\/2014\/3\/12\/munchery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Project feature on The Dieline<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/munchery_cooler.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Munchery done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Cooler delivery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/munchery_flat_boxes.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Munchery done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sample boxes.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/munchery_app.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Munchery done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>iOS app.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/munchery_icons.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Munchery done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icon system.

Period. The plaid-slash-tartan texture ties all the packaging together with a pajama-like comfort that makes Munchery something you want to bring into your home, unlike  styrofoam boxes that you can&#8217;t wait to get rid of.
