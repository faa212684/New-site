This past March, the Singapore Tourism Board launched a new positioning and identity, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yoursingapore.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Your Singapore<\/a>, to attract tourism, business and the MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences and Exhibitions) market. The identity and advertising have been created by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bartleboglehegarty.com\/#\/asiapac\/news\/what-will-your-singapore-be\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BBH Asia-Pacific<\/a> and it replaces the previous &#8220;Uniquely Singapore&#8221; campaign.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>&#8220;The new brand identity underscores Singapore&#8217;s commitment to building synergistic partnerships, which is underpinned by our pro-business and future-oriented environment as well as our expertise in bringing together international business leaders, industry experts and policy makers for the robust exchange of ideas and business networking opportunities. Together with other Singapore government agencies, local associations, academia and research institutions, STB works closely with event planners and organisers to co-create innovative and content-driven platforms and collaborate to successfully execute these ideas,&#8221; said Mr. Oliver Chong, Director, Conventions &#038; Meetings, Singapore Tourism Board.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.etravelblackboardasia.com\/article.asp?id=71175&#038;nav=13\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press Release<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/your_singapore_map_overlay.gif\" alt=\"Your Singapore\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Overlay of logo with map of Singapore.<\/p>\n<p>The old logo wasn&#8217;t something that would make you drop everything you were doing, buy a ticket to Singapore, and visit. It&#8217;s probably a visual clich&eacute; but the typography conveyed Asian-Pacificness. In contrast, the new one conveys InsertYourNameHereGeneric.comness but it at least tries to be something more engaging and, literally, more dynamic. If you are able to look past the boring typography, the imagery behind it is interesting. As the image above shows, the clump of shapes makes a contour of Singapore&#8217;s shape and as seen in the video below, that imagery can animate fairly cool. Everything lacks one level up of sophistication like Wolff Olins&#8217; AOL work, which shares a lot of graphic similarities with this, but for a destination brand it&#8217;s not as boring or downright bad as they can get.<\/p>\n<iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text\/html\" width=\"574\" height=\"352\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/6XaeKweYFvU?rel=0&amp;hd=1\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe>\n<p class=\"caption\">&#8220;Living Logos.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/your_singapore_detail_00.gif\" alt=\"Your Singapore\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/your_singapore_detail_01.jpg\" alt=\"Your Singapore\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/your_singapore_detail_02.jpg\" alt=\"Your Singapore\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/your_singapore_various.jpg\" alt=\"Your Singapore\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to Wu Zhuoyi for original tip and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hklmgroup.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Andre Redelinghuys<\/a> for reminder tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_101101_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_101101_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_101101_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_101101_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,64,26],"tags":[287,179,42,365],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1233"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1233"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1233\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1233"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1233"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1233"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
