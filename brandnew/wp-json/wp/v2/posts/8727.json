The way it works is that a presenter will have a slide with a multiple-choice question and the audience can access that question online through a menti.com short URL on their phones and the presenter&#8217;s slide will populate with the answers as they come in through data visualizations. You can create full presentations directly on it or there is a PowerPoint plug-in &#8212; no Keynote yet, which is a shame as I would definitely give this a try. Based in Stockholm, Sweden, Mentimeter has 84 employees with paid customers &#8212; there is a free version but &#8220;Data may be anonymized and used for inspiration&#8221; &#8212; in more than 120 countries. Recently, Mentimeter introduced a new identity designed by Stockholm-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.boldscandinavia.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bold<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>Our new identity takes its visual cues from bars, pies, lines and dots; the most commonly used data graphics. They are the building blocks of a Menti experience. Our logotype combines the fun and seriousness that our users tell us makes Mentimeter so special. It is made from two elements, the Mentimeter symbol and wordmark.<br \/><br \/>The symbol is a playful take on well-known data visualizations. There&#8217;s our main symbol, but just like every Menti is unique, we&#8217;ve developed a family of ever-changing variations. And yes if you think the icon looks a bit like an M you get extra points. Where our symbol expresses the fun and energy of Mentimeter, our wordmark represents the reliability and user-friendliness of our platform.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mentimeter.com\/blog\/stay-current-with-mentimeter\/new-look-same-menti\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mentimeter blog post<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mentimeter_ingredients.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Mentimeter by Bold\" \/>\n<figcaption>Identity ingredients come from chart graphics.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mentimeter_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Mentimeter by Bold\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mentimeter_monogram_variations.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Monogram variations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo was pretty decent &#8212; and a huge improvement over the company&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Mentimeter\/photos\/a.372320226165104\/452030161527443\/?type=1&#038;theater\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">original logo<\/a> &#8212; with a simple bar chart inside a speech bubble that connected the idea of letting the audience&#8217;s voice be heard and channeling that into data visualization. The wordmark was solid too. If it had any shortcomings maybe it would be that it was too literal and not much fun. The new logo is less literal and more fun, with an abstract &#8220;M&#8221; constructed from flotsam and jetsam of data visualization language. I&#8217;m not convinced it would be an instantly recognizable reference without an explanation but it&#8217;s a logo that certainly spikes curiosity. The animations help in that the bits and pieces animate, more or less, the way data visualizations would and I do enjoy all the different variations. The wordmark, part of a new type family, is nice&#8230; I like the dramatic plunge of the &#8220;M&#8221; and the tilted &#8220;e&#8221;s add some welcome rhythm.<\/p>\n<blockquote>As part of our identity, we have created a bespoke typeface called Menti Sans. With its quirky details, it is a subtle reference to the world of bar charts, without compromising on accessibility.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mentimeter.com\/blog\/stay-current-with-mentimeter\/new-look-same-menti\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mentimeter blog post<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mentimetertypography.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Custom type family.

Overall, this feels right for the product and creates an identity that feels, in a way, less passive and more interactive&#8230; a subtle reflection on what their software does.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 2014, Mentimeter is an interactive presentation platform that allows presenters to receive real-time data input from an audience.
