The suffix &#8216;-ing&#8217; expresses the idea of movement, one of the constants in the Group&#8217;s history, as well as its international dimension. The stem &#8216;ker&#8217;, meaning home in Breton, is a proud reminder of our origins in the Brittany region of France.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kering.com\/en\/press-releases\/ppr_becomes_kering\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press release<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kering_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"Kering Logo, New\" \/><\/p>\n<blockquote style=\"margin-bottom:20px;\">Our new emblem, the owl, represents vision, as well as being a sign of wisdom. A discreet and protective animal, it is a powerful symbol for a Group that spots potential and guides and nurtures its brands and people.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kering.com\/en\/press-releases\/ppr_becomes_kering\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press release<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>With its sharp vision and 270&deg; swiveling radius of the head, the owl represents Kering&#8217;s visionary character and foresight, its ability to anticipate trends and spot the potential in people and brands. A protective and unobtrusive creature, the bird of the goddess Athena, it symbolises wisdom and intelligent activity.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kering.com\/sites\/default\/files\/dp_name_change_with_cover_en.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PDF dossier<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kering_logo_detail_owl.gif\" alt=\"Kering Logo, New\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The previous logo was exactly what most acronym-based logos for corporations end up looking like: stiff and forgettable. Nothing necessarily wrong with it but when you see the alternative, as is the case here, you wonder why companies will settle for so little. The new logo is an excellent evolution that establishes the parent company of all these luxury brands as a brand all its own. (It could be argued that a parent company should not call too much attention to itself and recede to the background with a stiff and forgettable logo). The owl icon is charming and sophisticated, something you could see debossed on a black leather folder with financial numbers inside, yet, in the way the owl&#8217;s face is drawn, there is an interesting playfulness to it. The airy wordmark is a great complement to the owl, if a little big in relationship. It has just the right amount of customization in the little swashes on the &#8220;K&#8221; and &#8220;R&#8221; and nothing more.<\/p>\n<blockquote>Lastly, our new signature, &#8216;Empowering Imagination&#8217;, places imagination at the heart of our business, enabling us to create value in the widest sense. At Kering, we encourage and take care of imagination to push our brands and teams to new limits, to create, innovate and realise their artistic and financial potential &mdash; in the most sustainable manner.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kering.com\/en\/press-releases\/ppr_becomes_kering\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press release<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kering_signature.gif\" alt=\"Kering Logo, New\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kering_ads_01.jpg\" alt=\"Kering Logo, New\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kering_ads_02.jpg\" alt=\"Kering Logo, New\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Launch campaign print ads, how all the elements come together.<\/p>\n<p>Then things start to get wonky in application and with the introduction of the handwritten signature.

This is only the launch campaign and its point is to communicate the name change and introduce the brand&#8217;s elements so hopefully as recognition rises, the applications will get better.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/witekgottesman.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Witek Gottesman<\/a> for the tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_130514_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_130514_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_130514_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_130514_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_130514_config_03.xml&#038;xyz=poll_130514_votes_03.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv3\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv3\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[36,12,26],"tags":[230,45,870,149],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2466"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2466"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2466\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2466"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2466"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2466"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
