(Their work is pretty nice.) The new identity, designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/tm-studio.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TM<\/a>, revolves around a great wordmark with a clever &#8212; and, to my eyes, previously unseen &#8212; treatment of &#8220;ru&#8221; where the &#8220;u&#8221; is the &#8220;r&#8221; rotated. This makes the &#8220;r&#8221; and the &#8220;u&#8221; appear very condensed next to the other letters but when you look at it more like a ligature, the &#8220;ru&#8221; pair has a similar width to the &#8220;g&#8221; and the actual &#8220;ff&#8221; ligature. The trick is obviously better when there is something that divides the &#8220;r&#8221; from the &#8220;u&#8221;, whether it&#8217;s the pattern on the business cards or the green band in the project packet but even on its own I find it highly satisfying. The applications are great too, with the gray, white, and green color palette all working to accentuate and highlight the logo. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/the-brandidentity.com\/feed\/gruff-by-tm\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Freyja by studio NUR<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_freyja.jpg\" alt=\"Freyja by Eszter Laki and R\u00e9ka Imre\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/freyja_thecroissantstory\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Freyja<\/a> is a croissanterie in Budapest, Hungary, that makes some decadent-looking croissants and then fills them with sweet and savory options. Designed by local firm <a href=\"https:\/\/studionur.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Studio NUR<\/a>, the identity is very straightforward with a lot of white space and a limited color palette of jade green and white with the logo on things&#8230; but, folks, the logo is a cute boat made from a croissant and I&#8217;m dying. It brought a smile to my face when I saw it. It&#8217;s a simple, charming idea and it&#8217;s complemented with a cool wordmark that follows the hard-angle construction of the icon (at least the &#8220;A&#8221; does). I kind of wish the identity were a little bit &#8220;louder&#8221; with a bigger logo, bigger colors, and overall bigger presence, but I can appreciate the peace and calmness they went with. As a bonus, there is a large illustration where everything depicted in it is made of croissants. Insert crying-laughing emoji here.  <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/studionur.com\/freyja\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Rosa by Mundial<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_rosa_pizza.jpg\" alt=\"Rosa by Mundial\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Pizzeri%CC%81a-Rosa-319841928601010\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rosa<\/a> is a pizzeria in Montevideo, Uruguay, slinging &#8220;slow-fermenting dough pizzas cooked in a wood-fired oven&#8221; pies. The name, aside from translating to rose, the flower, also translates to pink in Spanish and this is the pink-est pizza place identity you are most likely to see. Designed by local firm, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mundial.com.uy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mundial<\/a>, the identity revolves around a very quirky flared serif full of personality that looks great everywhere, from pizza boxes to hats to facade. Unrelated to the logo but fun in their own right are a set of illustrations of a man with a rose and a woman with a pizza and if human relations were as simple as that &#8212; not focusing on the genders but the gesture of rose + pizza = life &#8212; we would all be better off in this world. Also if we used more fun fonts. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mundial.com.uy\/proyectos\/rosa.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"A minimalist-ish and fun-ish range of projects this week, with work from London, Budapest, and Montevideo&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[58,11,85,26],"tags":[953,1065,879,337,762,1464],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7811"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=7811"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7811\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=7811"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=7811"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=7811"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
