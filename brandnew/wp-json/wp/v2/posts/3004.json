The system itself extracts the two triangles found in SKY&#8217;s old logotype to create a refreshingly simple and iconic navigational device. Pause a moment, hero a character, expand a story &mdash; the brand is all about the journey through content, emotion and unlimited experiences.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.standapart.com.au\/index.php\/sky-nz-rebrand\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Interbrand case study<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/85312064?color=c60c30\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Brand video.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sky_new_zealand_the_dial.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for SKY by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>The &#8220;dial&#8221; (a k a the triangle).<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>In essence the logo didn&#8217;t change. Much. The wordmark is exactly the same &mdash; you would have to pay me a lot of money to fight the urge to fix that wonky &#8220;S&#8221; &mdash; but the placing of it inside a triangle is fairly monumental for this kind of company. The SKY logo will now always be associated with this really noticeable holding shape, which is not a bad thing. But there is no backing out now: it&#8217;s triangles, from here to eternity. Or the next redesign. For now, as you will see below, the triangle approach pays off.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sky_new_zealand_posters_flat.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for SKY by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Fun posters.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sky_new_zealand_brochure.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for SKY by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brochure cover.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sky_new_zealand_brochure_inside.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for SKY by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brochure interior.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sky_new_zealand_outdoor_advertising.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for SKY by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Outdoor advertising.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sky_new_zealand_triangle_posters.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for SKY by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Fun, triangle-based posters.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sky_new_zealand_skywatch.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for SKY by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Skywatch program guide covers.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Triangles are fun, no doubt about it, and in this case they allow Interbrand and SKY to transform well-known pop culture icons into their own visual language, allowing it to appropriate a lot of reference material and give it a fresh spin.

I also like how they have used the new logo as a pointing and framing device that ties all the pieces nicely together. The all uppercase, blunt, sans serif typography works very well with the triangle-language and is a fine choice that adds just enough extra flavor.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sky_new_zealand_signage.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for SKY by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Signage.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">As usual, Interbrand Sydney adds a fun tone of voice and quirky copywriting that give SKY another tool to communicate in a unique way and with endless puns, variations, and re-contextualizations of well-known movie and TV quotes. Overall, this is a dramatically playful rebranding of a major entertainment organization and it plays out well across its varied applications.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Launched in 1990, SKY (not to be confused with Sky) is the leading (and only) pay television broadcasting service in New Zealand offering over 100 channels to more than 820,000 customers, commanding a presence of over 50% in New Zealand&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,66,26],"tags":[255,424,189,465],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3004"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3004"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3004\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3004"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3004"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3004"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
