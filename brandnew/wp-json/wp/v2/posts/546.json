For <em>that<\/em>?&rdquo; Such complaints are typically unwarranted, but in the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tulsaworld.com\/news\/article.aspx?articleID=070918_1_A15_hDesp05642\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">recent case of Broken Arrow, Oklahoma<\/a>, the critics may have a point.<\/p><!--more--><p>The city&rsquo;s unique name refers to a riverside site where Native Americans would break cane stalks to make shafts for arrows. As a logo, the city had simply used the symbol from the Oklahoma state flag with a broken arrow added above.<\/p>\n<p>In an effort to re-brand, Broken Arrow retained Kansas City&rsquo;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kuhnwitt.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kuhn and Wittenborn Advertising<\/a>, who produced a new logo featuring a wordmark in the now-gauche Papyrus typeface and an unbroken arrow that looks as though it could have been launched by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kuhn_wittenborn_logo.php\" onclick=\"window.open('https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kuhn_wittenborn_logo.php','popup','width=325,height=45,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false\">the twin archers of the agency&rsquo;s own mark<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The arrow has a long history as a logo design clich&eacute;. In 1978, Wally Olins railed against symbols &ldquo;&hellip; ending with an arrow, preferably pointing upwards and slightly to the right, indicative of Progress, Dynamism and a controlled but powerful thrust towards what is clearly a Better and Brighter Future.&rdquo; Broken Arrow&rsquo;s logo is clearly trying to evoke similar sentiments, as the tagline &ldquo;Where Opportunity Lives&rdquo; indicates (it turns out that opportunity also lives in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pvaz.net\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Prescott Valley, Arizona<\/a>, which used the line first).<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps this logo can be excused for clich&eacute; abuse, since it shows an actual, rather than symbolic, arrow. But the disjuncture between the symbol and the city name results in a visual oxymoron, a bit of surrealism worthy of <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Treachery_Of_Images\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ren&eacute; Magritte<\/a>. And even putting this aside, it still seems a shame that a city with such an interesting name should sport such a mundane symbol.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>James Bowie is a sociologist and researcher at Northern Arizona University.
