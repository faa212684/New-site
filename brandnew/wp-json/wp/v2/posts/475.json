Maybe ancient is too old of a word since many cultures still use abaci today. Although they vary from culture to culture most have beads suspended on metal rods in a frame.<\/p><!--more--><p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"A4abacus.jpg\" src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/A4abacus.jpg\" width=\"466\" height=\"235\" \/><\/p>\n<p>So how do you make an abacus into a logo? Well, as with many other literal word-as-company name, the temptation is to be well, literal. Apple, Shell, Target and others have all done very well with the literal route however for my personal taste, they&#8217;re a bit boring. I always want something a bit unexpected.  After all, if your company&#8217;s name is Key, do you need to show a picture of a key or do you use the opportunity to say something else? Maybe you do need to show a key.<\/p>\n<p>Abacus, &#8220;a leading marketing solutions provider&#8221; recently changed their logo from abacus beads to more of an abstract representation of an abacus. They say that the new logo &#8220;illustrates our dedication to reducing complexity&#8221; among other things. I like that. The world could actually use more complexity reduction. Using 42 letters to spell a 6-letter word seems to contradict this but it is very well done.<\/p>\n<p>As far as literal names and logos, I kinda like Orange, the British telecom company. They did use the color, but I always thought it was a bit clever to use a square as the holding shape as opposed to the more obvious circle. When comparing to another British company named Orange, I see the circle as boring.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Brandnew_abacus_orange.gif\" src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Brandnew_abacus_orange.gif\" width=\"470\" height=\"200\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The abacus also provides obvious imagery for a logo. Here are some abacus logos that are out there, ranging from literal to abstract.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Brandnew_abacus_Others.gif\" src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Brandnew_abacus_Others.gif\" width=\"470\" height=\"720\" \/><\/p>\n<p>I personally have no idea how they actually work but as a parent, I do know that they share a striking resemblance to the famed beads on a wire toy found in most pediatrician offices. I bet one of those would make good reference for a logo.
