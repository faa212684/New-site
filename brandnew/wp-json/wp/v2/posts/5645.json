Now owned by Redevco, the centre has recently undergone a \u00a37.5m refurbishment. The original buildings consisted of a 4 storey merchant square built in yellow sandstone and completed in 1841. The then owner, James Campbell, was knighted by Queen Victoria and later became Lord Provost of Glasgow. In celebration of the birth of the Prince of Wales, later to become Edward VII, he named his new building Princes Square. The Grade B listed buildings were developed by GRE Properties Ltd in the 1980s. The brief then was to preserve and restore the original buildings but create a modern shopping and dining centre of quality and distinction with an emphasis on style &#8211; which remains within the centre today.&#8221;<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/princess_square_composite_sketch.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Princes Square by Shine\" \/>\n<figcaption>Composite sketch image.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/princess_square_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Princes Square by Shine\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/princess_square_bag.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Princes Square by Shine\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/princess_square_tshirt_bag.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Princes Square by Shine\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/princess_square_tote.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Princes Square by Shine\" \/>\n<figcaption>Different kinds of bags.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/princess_square_logo_foil.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Princes Square by Shine\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/princess_square_leather_foil.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Princes Square by Shine\" \/>\n<figcaption>Production details.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/princess_square_indoor_ad.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Princes Square by Shine\" \/>\n<figcaption>Indoor ad.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/princess_square_holiday_ads.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Princes Square by Shine\" \/>\n<figcaption>Holiday campaign.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"(Est. 1988) &quot;Princes Square [in Glasgow, Scotland] opened in its current format as a shopping and dining destination in 1988.
