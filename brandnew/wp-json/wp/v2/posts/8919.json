Contested by 16 clubs, it operates on a system of promotion and relegation with the Belgian First Division B. Seasons run from late July to early May, with teams playing 30 matches each in the regular season, and then entering play-offs I or play-offs II according to their position in the regular season. Play-offs I (also known as the title playoffs) are contested by the top-six clubs in the regular season, with each club playing each other twice. Play-offs II (also known as the Europa League playoff) are contested by teams ranked 7 to 16 in the regular season, divided in four groups of four teams playing each other twice (six teams from the Belgian First Division B also take part in playoff II). The team finishing in 16th place is relegated. The competition was created in 1895 by the Royal Belgian Football Association.&#8221; (<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Belgian_First_Division_A\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wikipedia<\/a>)<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pro_league_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Belgian Pro League by Mirror Mirror\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pro_league_logo_secondary.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Belgian Pro League by Mirror Mirror\" \/>\n<figcaption>Alternate lock-up.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pro_league_advertising.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Belgian Pro League by Mirror Mirror\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pro_league_advertising_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Belgian Pro League by Mirror Mirror\" \/>\n<figcaption>Advertising.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pro_league_notebooks.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Belgian Pro League by Mirror Mirror\" \/>\n<figcaption>Notebooks.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/436413366?title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"360\" height=\"203\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>New look introduction video.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"(Est. 1895) &quot;The Belgian First Division A, or Belgian Pro League (officially Jupiler Pro League due to sponsorship reasons with AB InBev&apos;s brewer Jupiler) since the 2015-16 season, is the top league competition for association football clubs in Belgium.
