What has been great about the Coca-Cola (and Diet Coke) cans recently is that they look and feel comfortable, <em>not<\/em> trying too hard, and simply embracing its history and equity. This new design feels like it&#8217;s trying so, so, so hard to be cool and relevant while still trying to abide by that minimalism of its predecessor. Trying hard does not necessarily equate to it being bad as there is nothing inherently bad about this, it just seems like it&#8217;s trying to elevate something that isn&#8217;t quite there yet to iconic status.<\/p>\n<p>The main design element of the packaging is the thick line that goes from top to bottom and it creates a really odd, slightly unpleasant division on the cans, which is even more pronounced by how tightly the logo fits within &#8212; I&#8217;m sure if anyone drew up guidelines for the logo, this packaging would be breaking the minimum-white-space-around-it rule. &#8220;Coke&#8221; simply feels too confined. The bar works better in the flavor versions where the illustrations at the bottom break out from it and spread into the rest of the cans. It&#8217;s too bad, though, that the illustrations are so&#8230; weird. I wouldn&#8217;t categorize them as &#8220;bad&#8221; and they are well integrated but they look very clinical or like something you would find in a biology textbook.<\/p>\n<p>In essence, I guess, I don&#8217;t like the new packaging very much.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/diet_coke_2017_cans_all.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Diet Coke done In-house in Collaboration with Kenyon Weston\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/diet_coke_2017_lined_up_close_up.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Diet Coke done In-house in Collaboration with Kenyon Weston\" \/>\n<figcaption>Cans, in real life.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/diet_coke_2017_announcement.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Diet Coke done In-house in Collaboration with Kenyon Weston\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/diet_coke_2017_flavors_spinning_2.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Diet Coke done In-house in Collaboration with Kenyon Weston\" \/>\n<figcaption>Introduction animations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The line device does work well in application beyond the cans to establish a recurring graphic for the Diet Coke brand that is different from Coca-Cola&#8217;s wave.

I&#8217;m slightly indifferent to the change, I think both versions are viable, with the new one looking more elegant and the old one more playful. It&#8217;s also possible that &#8220;Diet&#8221; went on a diet and lost some weight.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/diet_coke_2017_logo_before_after_on_screen.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Diet Coke done In-house in Collaboration with Kenyon Weston\" \/>\n<figcaption>Another comparison shot of the logo update.

I get it that Millennials are poised to be the economic driving force of the next couple of decades (as Baby Boomers once were and still are) but I&#8217;m concerned that brands are not necessarily sticking to what made them the brand they are today but instead catering to the whims of folks like the ones shown in the video above, who, sigh&#8230; the majority of are slightly on the irritating side (and makes you wonder why brands will do anything to get on their good graces). Anyway&#8230; this redesign feels forced; I doubt it will hurt Diet Coke sales in any way and the new flavors might at least spur curiosity and increase sales at launch but I do have a feeling the design will not last longer than three, five years before another major redesign comes through, which is normal in consumer packaging but a bit of an antithesis to Coca-Cola, which exemplifies consistency and sticking to the same things for decades.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Launched in 1982, Diet Coke (or Coca-Cola Light in some markets) is the sugar- and calorie-free version of Coca-Cola and was the first new brand since 1886 to use the Coca-Cola Trademark &#8212; now there is, like, a hundred Coca-Cola&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,51,7,26],"tags":[1307,614,1045,53,309,1218],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6129"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=6129"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6129\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=6129"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=6129"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=6129"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
