This will be a rare opportunity to see how other designers present their work. There will be 12 sessions, each with a designer (or duo of designers) presenting their original PDF\/Keynote\/PowerPoint shown to one of their clients.<\/p><!--more--><p>There are only 2 months to buy tickets &#8212; early-bird prices end April 6 &#8212; and there wasn&#8217;t much build-up to the introduction of this event because we were trying to organize a different kind of event that didn&#8217;t proceed as expected so we did a quick pivot into this. We are delighted that we were able to get speakers willing to share their presentations and this will be a rare treat.<\/p>\n<p>Unlike the Brand New Conference, First Round will be more low-key, all the speakers will be local New Yorkers, all the presentations are about a single file for a single client (vs. BNConf where it&#8217;s more about a designer&#8217;s \u0153uvre), and the price is relatively accessible. (Bonus: for anyone also considering attending the Brand New Conference in New York this year, we are offering a 10% discount for it if you attend First Round.)<\/p>\n<p>Seating is limited to 468.
