As a bonus, for every purchase, Paws donates a meal to a shelter dog. Starting with dog food, the service will eventually include more pet types and other products. The identity for Paws has been designed by London, UK-based <a href=\"https:\/\/studiokoto.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Koto<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>Our visual and verbal  identity pays tribute to all our fun, silly, individual,  joyful pets &#8211; for a brand as unique as they are. Owning a pet will make you happier, fact. So all the elements of the Paws identity work together to communicate this  positivity &#8211; the amazing moments we share with our pets. Warm colours combine with art direction that shows healthy breeds in dignified, natural poses.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/studiokoto.co\/project\/paws\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Koto project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/paws_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Paws by Koto\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/paws_logo_paw_a.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Paws by Koto\" \/>\n<figcaption>Paw logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/paws_logo_paw_with_dog.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Paws by Koto\" \/>\n<figcaption>With dog.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>I thought we could start the week with a feel-good post, especially if your country team was on the losing end on any of this weekend&#8217;s World Cup matches &#8212; go Mexico! (sorry Germany). The logo for this new service comes in two variations, a horizontal version with cute, bubbly, chubby typography and a more square version where that same typography is arranged into a paw shape, which is the star of this identity. I am guessing that the paw version was the original proposal and that the horizontal version came second as a need for places where the name had to appear bigger. Without the paw version the horizontal version is just cute type but, when seen as a paw, the letters do look like the irresistible pads of dog paws.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/paws_logo_with_dog.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Paws by Koto\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/paws_ad_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Paws by Koto\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/paws_ad_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Paws by Koto\" \/>\n<figcaption>Ads.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/paws_posters.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Paws by Koto\" \/>\n<figcaption>Posters.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/paws_brochures.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Paws by Koto\" \/>\n<figcaption>Leaflets<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/paws_billboard.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Paws by Koto\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/paws_billboard_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Paws by Koto\" \/>\n<figcaption>Billboards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/paws_tshirt.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Paws by Koto\" \/>\n<figcaption>T-shirt.

The first billboard shown also has a cool treatment with the &#8220;S&#8221; blown up to help frame the content. The posters and ads are a little bare and it feels like the type\/logo\/photo compositions could still use more integration but, in general, anything with cute pets on them usually wins because pets are the best.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/paws_launch_materials.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Paws by Koto\" \/>\n<figcaption>Actual launch materials.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">The image above with the actual launch materials shows the more humble beginnings of the brand that can&#8217;t yet afford 3-color screenprinted boxes with custom tape.
