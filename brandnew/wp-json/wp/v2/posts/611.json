The free coffee for 30 minutes sure helped. But also, it&#8217;s been a news item in the making since the 1990s when Starbucks started its insurmountable growth that would eventually come to compromise and cripple its original modus operandi of small, personable and unique. Or, less ominously, the news has been brewing (sorry!) since January of this year, when Howard Schultz took the reigns back as CEO &mdash; after an eight year respite from running the coffee empire he set ablaze in 1987 when he bought Starbucks &mdash; in order to resuscitate the unimaginably flailing brand. And, today, surrounding the unveiling of a new coffee bean, the Pike Place Roast, Starbucks unleashed an unprecedented wave of brand nostalgia by deploying the original Starbucks logo on the masses, <a href=\"http:\/\/picasaweb.google.com\/smalrus\/StarbucksLaunchesPikePlaceRoast\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">starting with a sad replica of the original store, in New York&#8217;s Bryant Park<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/starbucks_cup.jpg\" alt=\"Starbucks Cup\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Starbucks cup replacing the typical cup.

One of Schultz&#8217;s rallying cries has been to return Starbucks to its origins, but I doubt anyone expected this extreme.

It will be interesting to see what kind of effect it will have. Will it grow as much equity as the green logo? Will it wreak havoc and cause confusion? Will people fuss about nipples and open-tailed mermaids on their cups? Two experts (please note that I refrained from adding quotes around the word &#8220;experts&#8221;, I&#8217;m trying to inhibit my sarcasm) do think this is the wrong move:<\/p>\n<blockquote>Especially when the replacement is arguably less attractive. &#8220;They took a logo that was lively and made it dull,&#8221; says Alan Siegel, chairman and chief executive of Siegel+Gale, the big brand consultant that has done work for American Express, Dell and many others. &#8220;If they&#8217;re trying to communicate a message about going back to their roots, the cup doesn&#8217;t work.&#8221;<br \/><br \/>Brand consultant Al Ries of Ries &amp; Ries puts it another way. &#8220;Brown is probably the worst possible color [for a logo],&#8221; he says. &#8220;The reason UPS has been successful with it is that no one else wants to touch the color.&#8221;<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.wsj.com\/buzzwatch\/2008\/04\/08\/grande-logo-switch-is-starbucks'-new-cup-grabby-or-a-grind\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Grande Logo Switch: Is Starbucks&#8217; New Cup Grabby-or a Grind?<\/em><\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p>Yeah, sure, the cup is somewhat dopey, unflattering, and lacks the finesse the rest of the Starbucks paraphernalia enjoys, but it sure signals change.
