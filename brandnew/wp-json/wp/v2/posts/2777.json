Of the latter, at least 150 or 200 are in New York&#8217;s five boroughs and out of all of these, one, in the financial district, is a concept store showing a new logo and new exterior and interior design.

Nothing too fancy or much of a destination but it made the Slurpee-hunting experience a little more enjoyable. We&#8217;ve also seen 7-Eleven overseas adapt a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_31.php#.Ul0chWTk80o\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">much-lauded identity designed by BVD for its coffee offering<\/a> but this is the first time we see an official new logo and complete rethinking of the store.<\/p>\n<p>Our man on the street, Jack, asked one of the store&#8217;s employee&#8217;s about the new store and got just enough juicy stuff like the concept being nicknamed &#8220;7-Eleven Next Generation&#8221; and this store being the first of four or five other concept stores with one of them soon to open in Chicago. Jack also noted that all the branded materials (cups, napkins, etc.) still have the existing logo, which indicates there is no intention to go completely broad with this change yet.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/7eleven_ny_concept_store_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Concept Store for 7-Eleven by WD Partners\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/7eleven_ny_concept_store_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Concept Store for 7-Eleven by WD Partners\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/7eleven_ny_concept_store_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Concept Store for 7-Eleven by WD Partners\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/7eleven_ny_concept_store_04.jpg\" alt=\"New Concept Store for 7-Eleven by WD Partners\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/7eleven_ny_concept_store_05.jpg\" alt=\"New Concept Store for 7-Eleven by WD Partners\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/7eleven_ny_concept_store_06.jpg\" alt=\"New Concept Store for 7-Eleven by WD Partners\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/7eleven_ny_concept_store_07.jpg\" alt=\"New Concept Store for 7-Eleven by WD Partners\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/7eleven_ny_concept_store_08.jpg\" alt=\"New Concept Store for 7-Eleven by WD Partners\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/7eleven_ny_concept_store_09.jpg\" alt=\"New Concept Store for 7-Eleven by WD Partners\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/7eleven_ny_concept_store_10.jpg\" alt=\"New Concept Store for 7-Eleven by WD Partners\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/7eleven_ny_concept_store_11.jpg\" alt=\"New Concept Store for 7-Eleven by WD Partners\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/7eleven_ny_concept_store_12.jpg\" alt=\"New Concept Store for 7-Eleven by WD Partners\" \/>\n<figcaption>Concept store in lower Manhattan.

The most surprising thing is the lack of the ubiquitous horizontal green and red stripes that are everywhere in the existing stores. A proper branding element but not the most flattering. In the new store, the most common element is the use of a bold slab serif &mdash; TheSerif Black Plain &mdash; that carries all the messaging and designates the different stations in a relatively funny way. All of the materials and textures of the store are also a welcome change; from the flat, white paint to wood panels, white tiles, and plenty of vibrant green furniture. And last but not least, the <em>potential<\/em> new logo: I&#8217;ve always enjoyed the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=7eleven+logo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">7-Eleven logo<\/a> and there is a high level of recognition in the uppercase lettering so I feel like it&#8217;s not the most efficient move to go to a lowercase name, although I really like how the &#8220;eleven&#8221; nestles under the &#8220;7&#8221;. Overall, this would definitely be a welcome change for the store on all fronts.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1927, 7-Eleven is the largest convenience store chain in the world with more than 50,900 stores in sixteen countries &mdash; amazingly, only 10,200 are in North America.
