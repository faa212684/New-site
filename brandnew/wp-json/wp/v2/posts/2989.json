Established in 2013 in Durham, NC, Ponysaurus is neither craft nor micro but a nanobrewery &mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ttb.gov\/beer\/beer-faqs.shtml#b10\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">an officially-acknowledged category<\/a> from the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau &mdash; that produces a range of eight beers that are &#8220;meant to be savored, appreciated, contemplated, philosophized, studied, nuzzled, and mindfully guzzled&#8221; and also billed as &#8220;the beers beer would drink if beer could drink beer.&#8221; To mark its first non-keg, retail availability it&#8217;s time to present their identity and packaging designed by Raleigh, NC-based <a href=\"http:\/\/baldwinand.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Baldwin&amp;<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ponysaurus_beer_kinds_10.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Ponysaurus by Baldwin&amp;\" \/>\n<figcaption>Full range of beers offered by Ponysaurus.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The logo, meticulously etched in the style of a 19th Century zoological illustration, features the company namesake, one of the sillier-looking creatures never to have walked the earth, with equine hindquarters and a dinosaur head and stunted little arms.<\/blockquote><h3>Provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ponysaurus_logo_detail_02.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Ponysaurus by Baldwin&amp;\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail. &#8220;The name Ponysaurus is meant to suggest a fusion of unlike parts, a chimera.&#8221;<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>This is absolutely ridiculous. And awesome. Etched by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.stevennoble.com\/main.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Steven Noble<\/a> &mdash; the go-to-guy for perfectly-crafted, old-timey, feel-good illustrations &mdash; the absurd premise of mixing a pony with a dinosaur is given instant gravitas that result in a surprising, captivating, and memorable logo. The inline, shadowed typography works very well in tandem with the etching style and is nicely done. The &#8220;x&#8221;s and dots and dashes get to be a little too much on the logo on its own but do work justifiably well on the packaging.<\/p>\n<blockquote>The bomber-size (1 pint, 6 ounce) bottles are paper-wrapped and 2-color printed, uniformly black and white across the entire line, with just a small gold callout for the individual beers&#8217; names. The paper wrap helps protect the beers from spoilage due to light. A Ponysaurus-liveried bottle tape, recalling the revenue tape seen on spirits bottles, spans the top.<\/blockquote><h3>Provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ponysaurus_bottles_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Ponysaurus by Baldwin&amp;\" \/>\n<figcaption>Bottle.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ponysaurus_bottle_full_04.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Ponysaurus by Baldwin&amp;\" \/>\n<figcaption>Bottle details.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>Collateral materials are intended to impart whimsy. Letterpress-printed Ponysaurus business cards double as bar coasters. A small menagerie of salesman&#8217;s give-aways and leave-behinds are hand-fashioned from assorted toy plastic dinosaurs and horses, sawn, sutured, and spray-painted gold. Logo&#8217;d wooden growler cases, more often seen holding two 4-pint growlers, are repurposed to hold four Ponysaurus bombers.<\/blockquote><h3>Provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ponysaurus_figurines_07.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Ponysaurus by Baldwin&amp;\" \/>\n<figcaption>Ponysaurus figurines.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ponysaurus_bottle_with_dino_06.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Ponysaurus by Baldwin&amp;\" \/>\n<figcaption>Figurine in the wild.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ponysaurus_coasters_2_08.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Ponysaurus by Baldwin&amp;\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ponysaurus_coasters_09.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Ponysaurus by Baldwin&amp;\" \/>\n<figcaption>Coasters.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">As if the pony and dinosaur illustration weren&#8217;t enough, the packaging and coasters show the logo inside what looks like an egg, adding to the absurdity of the brand &mdash; yet the application and execution are pure class. The giant paper wrapper feels luxurious but without being stuffy, like a street drunkard&#8217;s brown paper bag but awesome-r. With clients like this who needs fake projects? A warm round of applause to the clients, for letting wild stuff like this be designed and produced.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Continuing our hard-nosed reportage on the rise of craft and microbreweries as the most likely industries to generate kick-ass identity and packaging work I bring you Ponysaurus.
