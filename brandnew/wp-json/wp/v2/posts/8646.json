They offer four different soaps and each has a dignified name: Le Botaniste (The Botanist), La D\u00e9esse (The Goddess), Le Nomade (The Nomad), and Le Soliste (The Soloist), so you know this is isn&#8217;t your everyday run of the mill soap and the identity, designed by London, UK-based <a href=\"http:\/\/regularpractice.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Regular Practice<\/a>, reflects that with a stunning, elegant serif that looks equally great foil stamped on the colored-stock boxes as it does carved on the soap. I would almost feel guilty about using the soap and eroding the deboss with my grubby hands. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/regularpractice.co.uk\/archive\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Denada by Jo Cutri Studio<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_denada.jpg\" alt=\"Denada by Jo Cutri Studio\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.denadaco.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Denada<\/a> is a brand of ice cream in Australia made without sugar, emulsifiers, or other weird stuff &#8212; its name, in Spanish, translates to &#8220;Of Nothing&#8221; (as in, I&#8217;m guessing, &#8220;This ice is cream is made <em>of nothing<\/em> bad&#8221;) and also &#8220;You&#8217;re Welcome&#8221; (as in, I&#8217;m projecting, &#8220;Here is ice cream, <em>you&#8217;re welcome<\/em>&#8220;). The identity and packaging, designed by Melbourne, Australia-based <a href=\"https:\/\/jocutri.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jo Cutri Studio<\/a>, follows the minimalism of the ingredients list with a very straightforward geometric sans serif logo that isn&#8217;t the most creative but is saved by the fact that all letters have a curve, giving it an inherent pleasant rhythm. The logo looks great on the equally minimally packaging that, while also straightforward, stands out for its unexpected three-way color combinations and ample white space around the logo. I would buy one of each flavor just to decorate my freezer. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/jocutri.com\/Denada\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Crown Affair by Placeholder<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_crownaffair.jpg\" alt=\"Crown Affair by Placeholder\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.crownaffair.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Crown Affair<\/a> is a haircare brand that offers a full spectrum of quality products to, well, care for your hair, including brushes, combs, oils, and towels. The identity, designed by Brooklyn, NY-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.placeholder.nyc\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Placeholder<\/a>, has a striking balance of elegance and quirkiness best embodied by the wordmark in a classy, extended sans serif that features some anti-ink-traps in the &#8220;F&#8221;s and funky &#8220;R&#8221;s &#8212; a matching, text font designed with Grilli Type is also quite nice. A complementing icon of abstract luscious curls (although it&#8217;s used sideways, which also makes it look like wind dramatically blowing someone&#8217;s hair) makes spare but enjoyable appearances and the color palette across all the products and materials is spot on. Also, I never thought I would swoon for a comb &#8212; which I don&#8217;t even use &#8212; but those are some fine-looking combs. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.placeholder.nyc\/crown-affair\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"A wide range of wordmark heroes this week, with work from London, Melbourne, and Brooklyn&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[51,11,75,26],"tags":[930,781,1130],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8646"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=8646"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8646\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=8646"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=8646"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=8646"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
