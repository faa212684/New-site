Perfecting their recipe since 2000 when they sold their froyo from a trike and later from a Range Rover on a beach, Lick&#8217;s retail following grew tremendously and they started packaging their product in tubs for distribution in other stores. Last September, despite long lines of customers, Lick decided to close its storefront to focus on its retail business, which now includes presence in Sainsbury&#8217;s &mdash; the second largest chain of supermarkets in the UK &mdash; as well as Ocado, Wholefoods, LEON, Picturehouse Cinemas, Budgens and more. To coincide with this, a new logo and tub were designed by London-based <a href=\"http:\/\/thiswayupdesign.com\/lick-yogurt\/4581560108\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">This Way Up<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lick_frozen_yogurt_store_closing.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Lick by This Way Up\" \/>\n<figcaption>Storefront closing message.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lick_frozen_yogurt_sailsburys.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Lick by This Way Up\" \/>\n<figcaption>Excited about the inclusion of Lick at Sainsbury&#8217;s.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lick_frozen_yogurt_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Lick by This Way Up\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo, before and after.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo was pretty great. I prefer it much better to the new one. If only the rough\/wobbly texture of the mouth icon had been captured in the script wordmark it would have been a solid winner. The new logo is too&hellip; mouthy and tongue-y. It almost starts to look too provocative. And I&#8217;m not being a prude. I&#8217;m just thinking of dozens of wide-open mouths and wagging tongues sitting on store shelves fighting for attention. The innocence of the old logo and tub got lost in translation and perhaps that was part of the plan, to age it up a little bit. Or, heck, perhaps <strong>I am<\/strong> being a prude.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lick_frozen_yogurt_tub_flavors.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Lick by This Way Up\" \/>\n<figcaption>The different flavors.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lick_frozen_yogurt_tub_top.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Lick by This Way Up\" \/>\n<figcaption>Lid.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lick_frozen_yogurt_tub_sides.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Lick by This Way Up\" \/>\n<figcaption>Side views.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">I generally mourn the loss of Cooper Black but, in this case, it wasn&#8217;t being used particularly well and the overall design of the tub wasn&#8217;t particularly good, with at least three different (and unrelated) typefaces in use plus a strange background that didn&#8217;t seem to have anything to do with anything else. The new tub is crisp and direct, just the big logo and a faux handwritten font &mdash; same note as yesterday: character alternates, people! The sides of the tub seem to be more on brand than the front, with the charming story of the two childhood friends and the rough\/wobbly texture in play. It&#8217;s like two different, conflicting messages and attitudes are being offered. Still, the overall presentation is more effective in the redesign and wider distribution calls for bolder presence and this delivers.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Opened in 2008 by childhood friends Owain Williams and Ky Wright, Lick is credited as being the first frozen yogurt store in the UK, having set up shop in the shopping and residential district of North Laines in Brighton.
