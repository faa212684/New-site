If you don&#8217;t mind, I&#8217;ll repeat the same introduction from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/a_penney_for_your_thoughts.php\">last year<\/a>: First opened as a dry-goods store named the &#8220;Golden Rule&#8221; in Kemmerer, Wyoming by James Cash Penney in 1902, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jcpenney.net\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">JCPenney<\/a> today is a publicly-traded company with 1,100 department stores across the U.S. and Puerto Rico, mostly in shopping malls. Providing fairly decent middle-of-the-road merchandise, JCPenney is an extremely popular destination for finding affordable items without the top brand names attached &mdash; they develop many of their own brands. \/ End recycled intro. \/ &#8220;Every initiative we pursue,&#8221; starting February 1, reads the press release, &#8220;will be guided by our core value to treat customers as we would like to be treated &mdash; fair and square.&#8221; New store designs, new brand names, new spokesperson partner in Ellen DeGeneres, and &mdash; yay &mdash; new logo and identity will be rolled out. No design firm is credited (leads anyone?).<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>The new jcpenney logo, which combines the elements that have made jcpenney an enduring American brand, by evoking the nation&#8217;s flag and jcpenney&#8217;s commitment to treating customers Fair and Square.  The square frame imagery will be evident throughout all of jcpenney&#8217;s marketing, to remind customers to frame the things they love.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/jcpenneys-transformation-plans-revealed-at-launch-event-in-new-york-city-138045223.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press Release<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/jcp_2012_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"jcepenney\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The old logo, designed by a graphic design student at the University of Cincinnati and selected from about 200 options jcpenney requested from others, was not formally or structurally bad but it looked like, well, a student-level design exercise. There was no there <em>there<\/em> in that new logo or in the one that preceded it. The new logo, I have to say, is damn impressive. It is amazingly simple, clear, and bold. It express the All-American feeling jcpenney is going for and it alludes to the American flag in a subtle and sophisticated way that makes every American Presidential candidate look like a doofus for not designing a logo like this before. This logo has the potential to transform the jcpenney brand from a mediocre mall brand into an American retail fashion icon like Tommy Hilfiger &mdash; perhaps not in quality but at least in appearance.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/jcp_2012_book_cover.jpg\" alt=\"jcepenney\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Cover of upcoming 96-page &#8220;book&#8221;, a new monthly perk.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/jcp_2012_postcard.jpg\" alt=\"jcepenney\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Sample postcard. Free tip to jcpenney: lose the thick outer stroke, it dwarfs the logo.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/jcp_2012_bags_01.jpg\" alt=\"jcepenney\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/jcp_2012_bags_02.jpg\" alt=\"jcepenney\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The rest of the identity plays up the logo nicely, using it big and allowing the photography &mdash; playful and colorful &mdash; to show inside the red square. There is a lot of Gotham involved, which I guess has become as American as apple pie. I think it looks better in the logo than in the applications, as it starts to look a little more like an electronics store. Overall, this logo and identity are full of potential and is one of the most on-target identities for a large, very common-denominator consumer company that I have seen in a while.<\/p>\n<p>For additional images and video check out <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jcpmediaroom.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this surprisingly helpful and thorough press room<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/jcp_2012_entrance_02.jpg\" alt=\"jcepenney\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/jcp_2012_entrance.jpg\" alt=\"jcepenney\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Sample new store entrance.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to Rachel Mason for first tip.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_120126_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_120126_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_120126_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_120126_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,86,26],"tags":[292,314,477,309,42],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1812"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1812"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1812\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1812"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1812"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1812"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
