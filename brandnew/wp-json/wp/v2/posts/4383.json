Owned by Turner, TCM&#8217;s programming includes movies and TV series from the 1980s and &rsquo;90s &mdash; I guess the 1950s are too old to be classics. So if you want a showing of <em>Alf<\/em> followed by <em>Die Hard<\/em>, TCM has got you covered. In November TCM introduced a new logo and identity designed by Turner Latin America&#8217;s in-house design team, cleverly called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/injausdesign\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Injaus Design<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tcm_latin_america_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo and On-air Packaging for TCM Latin America by Injaus Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>While the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tcm.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">American TCM<\/a> retains the classic extended wordmark &mdash; which is a perfectly nice piece of typography, especially with the inline that was dropped by TCM LA at some point &mdash; the Latin American team has opted for something less&hellip; classic, I guess. It&#8217;s really hard to figure out what associations (if any) it&#8217;s trying to trigger. The typography is Art Deco-ish and the shadows could hint at a mid-century aesthetic but the &#8220;refresh&#8221; C-arrow thing is plain weird and anachronistic. It also doesn&#8217;t look good, particularly at small sizes when the arrow makes the &#8220;C&#8221; look top-heavy.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tcm_latin_america_ads.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and On-air Packaging for TCM Latin America by Injaus Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Social media banner ads.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>One nicer aspect of the redesign are the social media banners that showcase an interesting combination of color and typographic palettes that are cool on their own and as a system but also lack a clear reference to the programming, looking more like typography found in B-movie posters.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/ms2vcFmAwPE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>On-air package (lots of movie footage in between applications).

And it&#8217;s not the right direction either, feeling more like Nickelodeon mixed with an old version of TV Land. There is a cheap peel effect and an odd plastic sheen to everything. If the channel&#8217;s focus is on 1980s and &rsquo;90s I don&#8217;t know why they didn&#8217;t milk that aesthetic that is so chic right now and instead landed on this somewhat vintage, somewhat modern, and all-around confusing identity.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Launched in 2004, TCM (Turner Classic Movies) Latin America is a cable and satellite channel available across Latin America, Spain, and in the U.S..
