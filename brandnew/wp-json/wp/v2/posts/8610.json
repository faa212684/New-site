Servicing global film and TV productions, the NSFA touts a number of key benefits from shooting in the region: diverse and unique nature, architecture for all kinds of scenes, hubs for transportation to Asia and the rest of Europe, highly educated and skilled professionals, cost-effective production, peace and quiet, and top-notch technology (including, apparently, the world&#8217;s best drone pilots). The area got some recent attention when Christopher Nolan <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kftv.com\/news\/2019\/11\/18\/estonia-focus-christopher-nolans-tenet-boosts-profile-of-the-country\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">filmed parts of his upcoming move, <em>Tenet<\/em>, in Tallinn, Estonia<\/a>.

So, yeah, the logo is not much to look at or get excited by but even then, it&#8217;s a nice enough piece of condensed typography.<\/p>\n<blockquote>Also starring: film-related typography, and clever messaging that speaks to the industry insiders.<br \/><br \/>The latter helping to engage with people on a personal level, functioning as a killer conversation starter within an industry, where personal connections mean the world.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/bond-agency.com\/project\/north-star-film-alliance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BOND project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/north_star_film_alliance_guidelines_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for North Star Film Alliance by BOND\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/north_star_film_alliance_guidelines_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for North Star Film Alliance by BOND\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/north_star_film_alliance_guidelines_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for North Star Film Alliance by BOND\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/north_star_film_alliance_guidelines_04.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for North Star Film Alliance by BOND\" \/>\n<figcaption>Guidelines.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/north_star_film_alliance_business_cards.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for North Star Film Alliance by BOND\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/north_star_film_alliance_various.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for North Star Film Alliance by BOND\" \/>\n<figcaption>Various applications.

Perhaps it can be one too many movie puns in one project but they are definitely enjoyable. The green and black combo can be tiring &#8212; reading the text on their website is literally an exercise in retinal endurance &#8212; but, I&#8217;ll admit that it has always been one of my favorite color combinations and the appropriateness of its use for this project is enviable.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/north_star_film_alliance_website.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for North Star Film Alliance by BOND\" \/>\n<figcaption>Website.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/north_star_film_alliance_instagram.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for North Star Film Alliance by BOND\" \/>\n<figcaption>Instagram account.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/north_star_film_alliance_cujo.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for North Star Film Alliance by BOND\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stapler.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/north_star_film_alliance_phone_cases.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for North Star Film Alliance by BOND\" \/>\n<figcaption>Phone cases.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/north_star_film_alliance_notebook.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for North Star Film Alliance by BOND\" \/>\n<figcaption>Notebook.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/north_star_film_alliance_jacket.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for North Star Film Alliance by BOND\" \/>\n<figcaption>Jacket.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/north_star_film_alliance_tote.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for North Star Film Alliance by BOND\" \/>\n<figcaption>Tote bag.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/north_star_film_alliance_megaphone.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Floating megaphones.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">Overall, this has a bold energy to it that makes the NSFA feel like a lively, active partner to engage with while also making the underrated destinations of Estonia and Latvia feel much more accessible and energetic.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 2018 and launched earlier this year, North Star Film Alliance (NSFA) is a joint venture between the countries of Estonia, Latvia, and Finland to promote the region as a filmmaking destination.
