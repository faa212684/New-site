During the day and early evening, CNBC continues its programming focusing on business news and providing real time market coverage and financial information, that has attracted an affluent, male following <em>primed<\/em> for the content and look and feel of CNBC Prime. The logo and on-air package that provide a clear contrast between day and night were designed by New York, NY-based <a href=\"http:\/\/gretelny.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gretel<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>We engineered the look, feel, motion and voice to create a premium, masculine brand with an edge. Stark black and white photography and simple, monospaced type create a marked contrast to the busy, colorful, data-driven daypart. Language injects the design with a confident, cocky tone. In motion, the imagery shears into clean, graphic slices that ease from shot to shot with the precision of a Swiss watch.  A crisp logo resolve caps off every promo and ID. The mark itself is simple, balanced and bold.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/gretelny.com\/project.php?id=52\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gretel case study<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cnbc_prime_logo_detail.jpg\" alt=\"CNBC Prime Logo and On-Air Package\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Logo as window in regular and reverse uses.<\/p>\n<blockquote>&#8220;In prime, we&#8217;re taking a more personal look at business and money,&#8221; said Ackerman. &#8220;That backdrop encompasses all the elements of great story.

It&#8217;s about ambitions and second chances; failure and success.&#8221;<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/id\/100360861\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CNBC press release<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe src=\"http:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/64655813?portrait=0&amp;color=ffffff\" width=\"574\" height=\"323\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">On-air montage.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cnbc_prime_grid_small.jpg\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cnbc_prime_grid_small.jpg\" alt=\"CNBC Prime Logo and On-Air Package\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">The grid.

As unappealing as that demographic might be nowadays, the branding of CNBC Prime is both unquestionably on target and expertly done. The whole mood is very James Bond meets Gordon Gecko but with a great, graphic edge in the monospaced typography and big headlines. At times the look is so slick and minimalist that it looks like all those fake redesigns you see on Behance of minimalist American Airlines or whatever where you think, &#8220;No client would ever buy that.&#8221; But here they have and it works like a charm. An expensive charm. The logo is the least integrated element of the project &mdash; it sort of looks like the CNBC lettering and it sort of tries to do its own thing but it sort of doesn&#8217;t do either &mdash; but it&#8217;s not really a bad logo and it blends into the on-air graphics without calling much attention to itself, not that it would have any luck trying what with all those fast cars and babes.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_130429_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_130429_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_130429_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_130429_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[66,12,26],"tags":[45,751,290,654],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2443"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2443"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2443\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2443"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2443"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2443"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
