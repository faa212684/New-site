Earlier this year, SFAF adopted a new identity, designed by San Francisco based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mortaragency.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mortar<\/a>, to carry the organization forward as it continues its unfortunately endless quest to control AIDS\/HIV.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sfaf_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"San Francisco AIDS Foundation Logo, Detail and Applications\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sfaf_logo_application.jpg\" alt=\"San Francisco AIDS Foundation Logo, Detail and Applications\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Logo and applications with photography.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>What I like the most about this identity is how uncomfortable it is. It is not pretty, or cool, or nice. The angled, jarring type, inside the puncturing polygon shape is like an uncomfortable thorn that just won&#8217;t go away, bitterly like the disease itself. The integration of the logo and the black and white portraits emphasizes the human aspect of the organization and helps make sure other people connect with on a more personal level.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sfaf_icons.gif\" alt=\"San Francisco AIDS Foundation Logo, Options\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>The logo can be rendered as a classic square shape for more conservative uses or it can morph into a variety of increasingly progressive polygon shapes.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sfaf_stationery.jpg\" alt=\"San Francisco AIDS Foundation Stationery\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The overall effect of the identity is every energetic and bold, which are the right kind of attitudes needed to carry on this important work.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Thanks to John Colucci for the tip.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,72,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/826"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=826"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/826\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=826"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=826"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=826"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
