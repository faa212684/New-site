The channel features lifestyle, historical and travel programming focusing on the culture of the United States. The network first launched in 1996 as Discovery Travel &amp; Living, as part of a suite of four digital cable networks the company launched that year. From its launch until 2008, the network primarily focused upon home improvement, cooking, and leisure-themed programs. In 2008, the network re-launched as Planet Green, which carried a focus on environmentalism and sustainable living; Discovery spent $50 million on developing programming for the network. Planet Green was ultimately considered a failure; by 2010, the network had begun dropping its environmental programming in favor of reruns of other programs from Discovery Communications&#8217; library, leading into its 2012 re-branding as Destination America. As of February 2015, approximately 57,238,000 American households (49.2% of households with television) receive Destination America.&#8221; (<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Destination_America\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wikipedia<\/a>)<\/p><!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/destination_america_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo and On-air Look for Destination America by Ferroconcrete\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/destination_america_icons.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and On-air Look for Destination America by Ferroconcrete\" \/>\n<figcaption>Iconography.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/destination_america_type.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and On-air Look for Destination America by Ferroconcrete\" \/>\n<figcaption>Type stylings.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/123768775?color=000000&#038;title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>On-air montage.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"(Est. 2012) &quot;Destination America is an American digital cable and satellite television channel that is owned by Discovery Communications.
