Long known as a savvy, hard-working financial centre, Switzerland&#8217;s largest and wealthiest metropolis has also emerged in the 21st century as one of central Europe&#8217;s hippest destinations, with an artsy, post-industrial edge.&#8221; In charge of getting people there is <a href=\"https:\/\/zt.zuerich.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Z\u00fcrich Tourism<\/a>, the organization responsible for destination marketing and the branding of the city as a diverse tourist destination. Last month, Z\u00fcrich Tourism introduced a new identity designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.marcuskraft.net\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Studio Marcus Kraft<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>The core concept is a flexible logo system comprising the expandable wordmark \u2039z\u00fcrich, switzerland\u203a. it is a \u2039story telling logo\u203a that gives the possibilty of infinite logo variations and interplay with various contents.<br \/><br \/>The design refers to the heyday of swiss graphic design in the 60s, where zurich was one of the hot spots. the custom typeface is based on the original helvetica, the \u2039neue haas grotesk\u203a which was drawn by max miedinger in zurich in 1956\/57.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.marcuskraft.net\/portfolio\/zurich_tourism.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Studio Marcus Kraft project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/zurich_tourism_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Z\u00fcrich Tourism by Studio Marcus Kraft\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/zurich_tourism_logo_animation.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Z\u00fcrich Tourism by Studio Marcus Kraft\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo variations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.zh.ch\/internet\/de\/aktuell\/news\/medienmitteilungen\/2011\/187_world_class.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">introduced in 2011<\/a>, was kind of weird, with a funky unicase approach and some strange shadows lurking under the wordmark. Other than having the Swiss cross next to it, I&#8217;m not sure it communicated much. Not that the new logo communicates much either; although, well, it actually communicates a lot verbally but not emotionally and aspirational it is not. The big, grand concept is Helvetica, because Helvetica and the applications are all flush left, ragged right, because Swiss Style. Granted, if any city can claim Helvetica, it is Z\u00fcrich, since its designer, Max Miedinger, is from there and designed it there but, still, as the selling point for a tourism brand, it&#8217;s as bland as the font itself.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/zurich_tourism_font.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Z\u00fcrich Tourism by Studio Marcus Kraft\" \/>\n<figcaption>Custom font.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The identity uses a slightly customized version of Neue Haas Grotesk &#8212; looks like they just rounded the dots &#8212; and there is nothing else to it, not even a sense of bold execution a la Experimental Jetset or Spin. This is as bland as it gets under the pretense of Swiss Style-ness.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/zurich_tourism_business_cards.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Z\u00fcrich Tourism by Studio Marcus Kraft\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/zurich_tourism_letterhead.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Z\u00fcrich Tourism by Studio Marcus Kraft\" \/>\n<figcaption>Letterhead and envelope.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/zurich_tourism_folder.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Z\u00fcrich Tourism by Studio Marcus Kraft\" \/>\n<figcaption>Folder.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/zurich_tourism_brochures.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Z\u00fcrich Tourism by Studio Marcus Kraft\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brochures.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/zurich_tourism_maps.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Z\u00fcrich Tourism by Studio Marcus Kraft\" \/>\n<figcaption>Maps.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/zurich_tourism_sign.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Z\u00fcrich Tourism by Studio Marcus Kraft\" \/>\n<figcaption>Office.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>All of the applications look fine because it&#8217;s hard to mess up this style but there is absolutely nothing here we haven&#8217;t seen a hundred times before. The one remotely interesting aspect of this is the changing text above &#8220;Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland&#8221; that can adapt to whatever is being promoted and the website does it interestingly with each page but that&#8217;s about it.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/JJkvT9H3cRY\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Promo video. Funny.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">I guess the identity does its job in being clear, concise, and conveying the clockwork efficiency of the city. It&#8217;s also important to acknowledge that Z\u00fcrich kind of sells itself as a destination and it doesn&#8217;t need a big-deal, emotionally-inspiring logo so it can certainly get away with the bare minimum of logos and an identity where being consistent is enough. It&#8217;s also important to admit my personal negative bias about Helvetica-as-a-concept so maybe I&#8217;m alone in my lack of enthusiasm for this but the feeling remains&#8230; zzzzz.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland&apos;s biggest city, is better summed up by Lonely Planet than me: &quot;Culturally vibrant, efficiently run and attractively set at the meeting of river and lake, Z\u00fcrich is regularly recognized as one of the world&apos;s most liveable cities.
