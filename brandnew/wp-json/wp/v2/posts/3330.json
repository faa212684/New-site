Seeking to rebuild their business model &mdash; from their portfolio of offerings, web properties, and approach to sales and customer relationships &mdash; and to elevate their reputation beyond &#8220;the world&#8217;s largest job board&#8221;, Monster recently introduced a new identity and brand positioning designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.siegelgale.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Siegel+Gale<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>The evolution of the Monster story begins with a new promise&#8211;the powerful idea of &#8220;Find Better,&#8221; a concept rooted much more in the &#8220;Better,&#8221; than in the act of searching. Building on this promise, Siegel+Gale recast Monster&#8217;s vision to be about &#8220;connecting the world&#8217;s jobs to people everywhere.&#8221; Siegel+Gale rebuilt the Monster brand architecture to focus on their three core capabilities of Reach, Connections and Solutions, radically simplifying their product portfolio and developed an entirely new visual identity that brought their B2B and B2C businesses more in line, while also communicating the brand&#8217;s new focus on empowering people to strive for improving their lives through work.<\/blockquote><h3>Provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/monster_logo_animation.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Monster.com by Siegel+Gale\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo animation.

The flag is symbolic of the individual achievement of finding better &mdash; literally planting your flag as a personal mark that you have successfully arrived in your quest for better.<br \/><br \/>The purple flag is unique to Monster in a space that is populated by very cold identities, the flag ads warmth and humanity and is unique as no country in the world uses a purple flag. The purple color historically used to come from sea snails making it very hard to come by and such only royals used this color.<br \/><br \/>The flag and the visual identity will inform and inspire Monster&#8217;s new suite of products starting today.<\/blockquote><h3>Provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/monster_logo_detail.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Monster.com by Siegel+Gale\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/monster_logo_detail_detail.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Monster.com by Siegel+Gale\" \/>\n<figcaption>Detail of logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Monster.com has always stood out for its TV advertising &mdash; from the excellent <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=myG8hq1Mk00\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">yes-man commercial<\/a> to more humorous fare like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4LRKyDH_h28\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this<\/a> &mdash; and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=monster.com+mascot&#038;tbm=isch&#038;ei=rbnDU93sKoSiyATA9IDQCA#q=monster.com+mascot&#038;tbm=isch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">its monster mascot<\/a>, sometimes used as part of the logo in the past, has served as a quirky identifier for the oddly-named company. But, as far as logos and wordmarks go, Monster&#8217;s late 1990s grunge-inspired typography has never really inspired awe or reflected the global importance of the service &mdash; put another way: it&#8217;s not a font you would use in your resume. The new logo does away with the original dot-com-boom aesthetic and literally plants a flag to signal a new era for the company. Typeset (weirdly as &#8220;MonsteR&#8221;) in a simple, geometric sans serif and set on a purple flag, the new logo makes for an attractive visual more in tune with the goal of seeking a job or employer. I enjoyed the concept and execution far more in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/current_lets_its_bold_flag_fly.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wolff Olins&#8217; work for Current<\/a> in 2011 but it&#8217;s interesting to see the type-on-a-flag approach applied to a global company as opposed to a small, edgy television channel.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/monster_stationery.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Monster.com by Siegel+Gale\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stationery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/monster_cover.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Monster.com by Siegel+Gale\" \/>\n<figcaption>Intro book cover.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/monster_cover_samples.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Monster.com by Siegel+Gale\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sample publication covers.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/monster_taxi.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Monster.com by Siegel+Gale\" \/>\n<figcaption>Taxi top.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/monster_outdoor_ad_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Monster.com by Siegel+Gale\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/monster_outdoor_ad_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Monster.com by Siegel+Gale\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/monster_outdoor_ad_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Monster.com by Siegel+Gale\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sample outdoor ads.

It looks particularly nice when it falls on top of photography as in the sample publication covers above. It&#8217;s also interesting that there is a logo version for whether the wind is coming from the East or West, which may be a far more daring move in itself than changing the logo. Other than that, the applications are a lot of purple, a lot of the same sans serif, and a lot of hopeful-looking photography, all of which is fine and decent, tempering down the previous monster-driven aesthetic. Overall, it&#8217;s really a drastic change for the company and it will help drive a slew of new, empowering messaging&hellip; I just wish it had a little more bite somewhere, either in the copywriting or some of the applications.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1999, Monster.com has become one of the (if not the) leading online employment resources, hosting over 200 million registered users worldwide since it started, with approximately one million job postings at any time, and providing support through more&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,36,26],"tags":[340,476,249],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3330"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3330"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3330\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3330"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3330"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3330"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
