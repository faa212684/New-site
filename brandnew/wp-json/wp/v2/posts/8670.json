They <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=KsccD4aBALk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ARE<\/a> pretty amazing (emphasis mine). The identity, designed by Sabadell, Spain-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/xavimiranda\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Xavi Miranda<\/a>, seems so obvious after he arrived at the result but it&#8217;s so perfectly clever and an infinitely satisfying typographic interpretation of what the group does. It&#8217;s the kind of design solution that would need to be included in future editions of <em><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2VxGmzg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A Smile in the Mind<\/a><\/em>. The selected sans serif is perfect with its &#8220;M&#8221; where its middle point touches the baseline, making it perfect for stacking and it&#8217;s the one identity where the trend of repeating the same line of text is actually meaningful. Overall, MMMM MMMM MMMM, delicious. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/58761401\/6M\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">68 Lenguas by Estudio Albino<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_68lenguas.jpg\" alt=\"68 Lenguas by Estudio Albino\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/mezcal68lenguas\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">68 Lenguas<\/a> (68 Tongues, as in languages) is an artisanal mezcal from Oaxaca, Mexico, where there about a hundred other artisanal mezcal brands. This one stands out for its logo and packaging designed by Guadalajara, Mexico-based <a href=\"https:\/\/albinoestudio.myportfolio.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Estudio Albino<\/a>. I am particularly in love with the logo that references <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mixtec\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mixtec<\/a> art in a unique way by embedding a &#8220;68&#8221; in the eyes of a human\/animal mask. The logo is complemented by a mix of of eccentric typefaces &#8212;\u00a0that blackletter &#8220;68&#8221; has me doing the rock and roll hand gesture &#8212; all laid out neatly and with plenty of white space in the label. I would buy this for the paper wrapper alone. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/albinoestudio.myportfolio.com\/68-lenguas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">The Drawing Room and St. Regis Bar by .Oddity Studio<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_stregis.jpg\" alt=\"The Drawing Room &amp; St. Regis Bar by .Oddity Studio\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">The Drawing Room and the St. Regis Bar are located in the luxury <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marriott.com\/hotels\/hotel-information\/restaurant\/hkgxr-the-st-regis-hong-kong\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">St. Regis hotel<\/a> in Hong Kong. The identity, designed by local firm <a href=\"https:\/\/odditystudio.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">.Oddity Studio<\/a>, establishes an elegant and high-end visual language that creates a unified yet distinct look for each of the two establishments, sharing a penchant for elegant radial lines and geometric motifs and patterns with everything deployed in gold foil stamp over a selection of sumptuous colored cloth covers. There is a design rationalization at the project page but I&#8217;m perfectly okay without it and just looking at the result. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/78728429\/The-Drawing-Room-Bar-at-St-Regis-Hong-Kong\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"A wide variety of styles and clients this week, with work from Sabadell, Guadalajara, and Hong Kong&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[51,66,11,73,26],"tags":[1307,782,633,261,1815,395],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8670"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=8670"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8670\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=8670"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=8670"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=8670"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
