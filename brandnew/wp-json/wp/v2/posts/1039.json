I&#8217;m no fashion hobbyist &mdash; my daily jean-and-t-shirt attire can confirm that &mdash; but I am a regular reader of <a href=\"http:\/\/thesartorialist.blogspot.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Sartorialist<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/putthison.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Put This On<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/svpply.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Svpply<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fashionista.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fashionista<\/a>. The latter providing that new school journalism that mixes sarcasm and irony with a deep understanding of the topic at hand. As part of the <a href=\"http:\/\/breakingmedia.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Breaking Media<\/a> network of blogs, Fashionista has grown to be one of the most read blogs in the industry, attracting 400,000 unique visitors a month. After living and publishing with a blackletter logo since 2007, Fashionista decided it was time to rethink it as it migrated its back-end from Movable Type to WordPress.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>The old logo was this oversized, domineering, gothic lettering thing that said &#8220;spiky, aggressive, old-school news brand.&#8221; That&#8217;s not what Fashionista is. The editors of Fashionista are excellent journalists who will be critical when it&#8217;s called for, but they&#8217;re also unashamedly fashion lovers. They might poke fun from time to time, but they&#8217;re not spiky or unnecessarily aggressive. And they&#8217;re also inherently new-generation when it comes to how they go about their business &mdash; they use a blog platform, Flip cameras, smartphones and various social media to deliver their content and engage their audience &mdash; so unless we were being very ironic with the gothic, old-school newspaper font thing it just wasn&#8217;t really appropriate. I love a bit of irony as much as the next guy, but even if that was the original intention it also gets tired when it&#8217;s a logo that tens of thousands of people re-visit every single day. I&#8217;m also a big believer that the logo and furniture on the site should be a little subservient to the content &mdash; it&#8217;s the content that engages and the content travels well beyond the site too &mdash; so we also needed something a little less imposing.<br \/>&mdash; Jonah Bloom, CEO\/Editor-in-Chief, Breaking Media<\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fashionista_texture.jpg\" alt=\"Fashionista\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The redesign was done by <a href=\"http:\/\/felixsockwell.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Felix Sockwell<\/a> &mdash; a regular commenter on Brand New &mdash; who created a lovely, custom wordmark that feels far more appropriate for Fashionista than the old logo did. In my opinion, fashion identity can be oversimplified to two categories: Bodoni or Didot for high-end fashion, and blackletter for street fashion. But I digress. Considering that, according to their media kit, 91% of their readers are women, the new logo caters more to that audience not by being simply girly but by being softer and more meaningful. The subtle dimensionality gives the logo a very nice boost and it&#8217;s something that looks great on screen, but could easily translate in one color in print. The concept of it being like a piece of thread is far more relevant to fashion than just a typeface choice, and few others do the single-line treatment like Felix can. Below is one of the alternate ideas as well as various sketches to get to the final logo.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fashionista_sketch_01.gif\" alt=\"Fashionista\" \/><\/p>\n<blockquote>The moment I saw Felix&#8217;s work on his blog I felt like he had a style that could be right for Fashionista. He&#8217;s done quite a bit of work for women&#8217;s brands and I like that he tends to create lettering that flows. I asked for a few different ideas, ideas that could work not only for a website but for, say, a storefront, and what really blew me away was that Felix didn&#8217;t just interpret that as &#8220;a few different looks&#8221; he actually came up with ideas &mdash; one of which involved bringing products into the logo dynamically, something we may still play with. The version we ended up going with originated from the idea of a piece of thread. We liked that notion because the craft of sewing is still so key to fashion design, but we also didn&#8217;t want it to be too overt and as Felix played with treatments to move away from that being obvious he hit on something that also had a neon-diner-sign quality to it, which appealed to me because I love 1930s &ndash; 60s diners and that sort of Americana. I also love that because it&#8217;s white out of black, like a neon strip on a backboard, it allows us to change it throughout the year &mdash; and make that background a color relevant to the season.<br \/>&mdash; Jonah Bloom<\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fashionista_sketch_02.jpg\" alt=\"Fashionista\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fashionista_sketch_03.jpg\" alt=\"Fashionista\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fashionista_sketch_04.jpg\" alt=\"Fashionista\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fashionista_sketch_05.jpg\" alt=\"Fashionista\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fashionista_sketch_06.gif\" alt=\"Fashionista\" \/><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_100224_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_100224_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_100224_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_100224_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,68,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1039"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1039"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1039\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1039"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1039"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1039"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
