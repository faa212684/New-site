Made through CO2 extraction that preserves whole-plant ingredients and natural components better than other, cheaper methods, their products use only natural ingredients, no synthetics, and they even provide a QR code on the packaging that will reveal lab reports &#8212; in general, they seem to be legit about being a good company trying to do good by the CBD industry by &#8220;taking action against misinformation, deceptive labelling, and soft truths&#8221;. The identity and packaging for Healist Naturals has been designed by Leeds, UK-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.robot-food.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Robot Food<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>We saw science and nature as fundamental pillars of the identity and Healist as the sweet spot in between, harnessing the two. For the brand to be its most impactful, this balance would have to be represented throughout the visual and verbal identity, starting with the creation of the &#8216;H&#8217; marque and demonstrated in the reveal of the split packaging.<br \/><br \/>In a category of cowboys, we needed to reinforce the efficacy of Healist&#8217;s all-natural ingredients. From a clean, clinical white as the brand&#8217;s primary colour to lab inspired iconography and detail, science forms the base of the brand, and is used as a consistent, reassuring structure on which the potential of nature and our bodies can be explored.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.robot-food.com\/work\/healist\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Robot Food project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/healist_brand_story.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Healist Naturals by Robot Food\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brand statement.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>&#8220;The &#8216;H&#8217; marque captures Healist&#8217;s spirit. One pillar represents science, the other nature, while a central dot joins the two and is symbolic of equilibrium,&#8221; says Steph Oglesby, design director at Robot Food.<\/blockquote><h3>Robot Food provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/healist_logo_plain.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Healist Naturals by Robot Food\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo, on its own.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/healist_logo.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Healist Naturals by Robot Food\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo, with botanics.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video controls controlsList=\"nodownload\" poster=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/healist_logo_animation.jpg\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/healist_logo_animation.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo animation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The logo, in plain clothes, is fine for the most part and definitely has a clean clinical feel that is reminiscent of high-end cosmetics, which is not an entirely bad thing. The rationalization on the &#8220;H&#8221; &#8212; &#8220;One pillar represents science, the other nature, while a central dot joins the two and is symbolic of equilibrium&#8221; is a little eye-roll-inducing but, sure, it&#8217;s well played and it gives the logo an ownable trait. When the &#8220;H&#8221; gets garnished with the ingredients&#8230; I dunno&#8230; I want to like it and I appreciate the effect, especially with the highly-detailed illustrations, but the floatiness of the ingredients is kind of weird. Still, on its own and as used on the website, the logo is pretty effective in signaling a clean, crisp product.<\/p>\n<blockquote>Healist&#8217;s product architecture is made up of four benefit ranges, each with its own collection of formats. For greater ease and clarity, we use master illustrations alongside benefit specific colours and iconography to pull each range apart. Each benefit icon nods to the circular focal point of the &#8216;H&#8217; marque and representative of the desired effect of each respective benefit.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.robot-food.com\/work\/healist\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Robot Food project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/healist_icons.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Healist Naturals by Robot Food\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icons.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/healist_guidelines.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Healist Naturals by Robot Food\" \/>\n<figcaption>Guidelines.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>With science as a base, we chose to bring nature to life as an adaptable living layer. Every ingredient is carefully considered and chosen for its known benefits &#8211; many of which have been around for hundreds if not thousands of years. We took inspiration from botanical drawings to create Healist&#8217;s master illustration style, illustrating each key ingredient across the Healist range.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.robot-food.com\/work\/healist\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Robot Food project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/healist_illustrations_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Healist Naturals by Robot Food\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/healist_illustrations_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Healist Naturals by Robot Food\" \/>\n<figcaption>Illustrations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The illustrations are pretty great and a nice respite from the minimalist trend.

Again, it&#8217;s nice and the slipcover is a beautiful gesture, but the rest feels very tried and true.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/healist_kit.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Healist Naturals by Robot Food\" \/>\n<figcaption>Kit.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/healist_packaging_advertising_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Healist Naturals by Robot Food\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/healist_packaging_advertising_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Healist Naturals by Robot Food\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/healist_packaging_advertising_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Healist Naturals by Robot Food\" \/>\n<figcaption>Out of home advertising.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/healist_packaging_advertising_print.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Healist Naturals by Robot Food\" \/>\n<figcaption>Print advertising.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/healist_packaging_social.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Healist Naturals by Robot Food\" \/>\n<figcaption>Social media.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">The additional applications, mostly advertising, are all fairly nice and convincing &#8212; the first set of posters shown are particularly attractive, mixing all of the identity elements in the right dosage.
