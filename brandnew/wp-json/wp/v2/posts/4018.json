Local designers <a href=\"http:\/\/www.marcal.net\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mar&ccedil;al P.<\/a> and Enric Cano turned that tagline into one of my favorite logos of recent memory with the name of the restaurant typeset on a curve with a heart on each end looking exactly like a sausage link. It&#8217;s almost dumb in its simplicity and concept but it&#8217;s so perfect. You could argue this would work with any other sausage-related logo but what makes this work is the length of the name and the name itself which has such an awesome sound to it, specially if you read it in English, as a verb: &#8220;I&#8217;m looking forward to the weekend, I am going butifarring&#8221;. The shorthand &#8220;B&#8221; monogram with the hearts is cute too and the applications are okay. It&#8217;s all about that logo, really. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/26151311\/Butifarring-Restaurant-(2013)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">The Kitchen by Rubber Design<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_honesttogoodness.jpg\" alt=\"The Kitchen by Rubber Design\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px;\">The Kitchen is the prepared-foods division of Whole Foods Market (sorry no link). I first saw this project as an entry in the 2013 Brand New Awards but the judges didn&#8217;t select it and for some reason everybody talked me out of Salvaging it. I stumbled on it the other day and remembered that I really liked it so since there is no one to veto my Friday Likes, here is this project from San Franscico, CA-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rubberdesign.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rubber Design<\/a>. It&#8217;s not a showstopper but it has some really great details and nuanced typography, particularly in the wrapping paper. You could argue it&#8217;s very hipstery but I think this is on the tier above hipsterism from which the lazier hipstery design derives its hipsterism. Or something. The limited color palette looks great on the the kraft materials and I love me a good squiggle. There are some additional, mid-Century-esque illustrations that only appear as posters and they are outstanding &mdash; I wish that aesthetic would have made its way into the other applications. Nonetheless this is good.

Now, <a href=\"http:\/\/lg2boutique.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">lg2boutique<\/a>, has released images of the interior design of the park&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/parcolympique.qc.ca\/centresportif\/en\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sports Center<\/a> and it&#8217;s just as stunning. The inline font is the main element and it looks great used big across the venue along with the rings of the logo. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s the color correction or not but the paint job and all the materials (from the seats to the floor tile) complement the identity&#8217;s color palette perfectly. Just really simple, beautiful work, perfectly executed. <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/26611989\/Parc-Olympique-Space-layout-of-the-Sports-Center\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/strong><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"From small to big we&#8217;ve got plenty of hearty selections this week, with work from Barcelona, San Francisco, and Montr&eacute;al&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[729,564,1166],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4018"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4018"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4018\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4018"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4018"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4018"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
