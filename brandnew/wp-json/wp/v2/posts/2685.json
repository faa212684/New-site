Some other <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/yt\/press\/statistics.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">facts<\/a> that would make Grumpy cat smile: More than 1 billion unique visits a month, over 6 billion hours of video watched each month, and 100 hours of video are uploaded every minute. Yet with all those people paying attention, YouTube hasn&#8217;t formally acknowledged a new logo that they have introduced on their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/youtube\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Facebook page<\/a> (76 million likes) and their <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/YouTube\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Twitter page<\/a> (32 million followers) but not on their main website. I rarely post a logo change without official confirmation but I am thinking that this is a full-on change in the making.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"red_100\">Update Aug. 30:<\/span> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2013\/8\/29\/4671362\/youtube-brand-new-logo-design\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Verge received confirmation from YouTube<\/a> that it is NOT changing its logo. &#8220;Our main logo is a core part of YouTube and is not going away. We are increasingly using our play button for apps and icons.&#8221; So, instead of going with a single, nicer logo they are just going to create confusion. That makes sense.<\/strong><\/p><!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/youtube_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo for YouTube\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/youtube_ios_icon.png\" alt=\"New Logo for YouTube\" \/>\n<figcaption>App icon.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/youtube_pattern.png\" alt=\"New Logo for YouTube\" \/>\n<figcaption>Pattern on Twitter page.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>I&#8217;ve never been a fan of the YouTube logo. It&#8217;s fine and much less annoying than most of the start-ups that went on to dominate the internet (i.e., PayPal, eBay, Google, etc.) so I have no qualms in seeing it go away. In exchange, they are establishing their big play button inside its own recognizable shape as the main identifier for YouTube, which is a perfect strategy since every time you watch a YouTube video it&#8217;s the first thing you see. It&#8217;s similar to Twitter going with the blue bird.<\/p>\n<p>The minimal shading inside the play button might feel familiar to those who went through <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_49.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the Google Visual Assets Guidelines<\/a> I posted in June that showcase Google&#8217;s commitment to visual simplicity and sophistication &mdash; this new YouTube logo and the pattern fall exactly within this aesthetic. It&#8217;s what a lot of people are calling the &#8220;Flat&#8221; trend &mdash; I call it the &#8220;Let&#8217;s Drop the Bullshit Volumizing and Do a Good Logo&#8221; trend, but I guess it&#8217;s just a matter of semantics &mdash; and it feels nice to have more and more visual simplicity on the web. The typography is unassuming and appropriately playing a supporting role. I do wish someone closed up the kerning on both sides of the &#8220;T&#8221; and on the &#8220;Y&#8221; before Maru uses them as tunnels to jump through but it&#8217;s a perfectly acceptable wordmark. Overall, Google and YouTube seem to be going in the right direction and I&#8217;ll take this new logo over the old one any day of the week.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"I am pretty sure everybody here knows what YouTube is: a cat-video discovery engine founded in 2005 by three former employees of PayPal and purchased for 1.65 billion cats dollars by Google.
