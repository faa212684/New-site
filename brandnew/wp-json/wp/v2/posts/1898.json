Earlier this month <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/rts.php\">we covered RTS<\/a>, the French language TV and radio channel. Now comes the German language radio and TV stations, established in 1931 and previously known as SR DRS (Schweizer Radio: Radio der deutschen und r&auml;toromanischen Schweiz, &#8220;Swiss Radio: Radio of the German and Romansh Switzerland&#8221; in English) which has been renamed <a href=\"http:\/\/www.srf.ch\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SRF<\/a> (Schweizer Radio und Fernsehen, &#8220;Swiss Radio and Television&#8221; in English). The logos for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.srf.ch\/Nachrichten\/Archiv\/2010\/11\/09\/Publizistisches-Angebot\/Fernsehprogramme\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the television channels<\/a> remain the same but the six radio stations have all gotten new logos.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/srf_logo_all.png\" alt=\"SRF Logo, Before and After\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Radio station identities aren&#8217;t necessarily industry breaking news but as part of this overall rebranding of SRG SSR it&#8217;s an interesting look at a very broad implementation challenge. While the RTS logos turned out to be a hot mess, these six logos are relatively better and for the most part have a consistent language that, at first glance, looks well resolved and unified but upon further analysis there are a lot of strange things going on.<\/p>\n<p>The main lock-up is hard to argue against: A big square, with &#8220;RADIO&#8221; and the SRF tag underneath. Cool, no problem. The second part also checks out: Big, white number or letter in center of square. Okay, next: sliced and bended numbers or letters. This is where things start to fall apart, with the &#8220;1&#8221; having none, the &#8220;2&#8221; and &#8220;4&#8221; a vertical slice but no bends, the &#8220;3&#8221; a diagonal slice and no bends, the 4&#8243; with a bend, the &#8220;V&#8221; with an insinuated slice and no bends, and &#8220;Musik Welle&#8221; with none. Then there are shadows: &#8220;1&#8221; has none but it has a glow, &#8220;2&#8221; has a very long outer shadow, &#8220;3&#8221; has an inner short and hard shadow, &#8220;4&#8221; has some subtle outer shadow, &#8220;V&#8221; has a very small inner shadow, and &#8220;Musik Welle&#8221; has none.<\/p>\n<p>There are glimmers of goodness in there though. The &#8220;2&#8221; and &#8220;4&#8221; have a very nice play with the name of the station and I wish they would have extended that idea into the &#8220;V&#8221; station and the word &#8220;Virus&#8221;. The long shadow in &#8220;2&#8221; seemed like an interesting way of adding tension inside the logo, but that execution never repeats. And &#8220;Musik Welle&#8221;, as weird and out of place as it seems, has a great flair to it that somehow works well in that blue box.<\/p>\n<p>Overall, it&#8217;s not terrible but it could have definitely used more policing in establishing parameters to work within.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.8am.ch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nick Lobeck<\/a> for the tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_120326_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_120326_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"574\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,63,26],"tags":[703,480,613],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1898"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1898"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1898\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1898"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1898"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1898"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
