The logo and idents for Drama have been designed by London-based <a href=\"http:\/\/dixonbaxi.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DixonBaxi<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>We developed a creative strategy that focussed the positioning of the channel and also reflected the two sides to drama. The shows tend to take place in beautiful, pastoral landscapes while they seem to also be the host of unsavoury crimes, tragedy, romance, comedy and suspense. Looking at both the emotional and functional elements of brand we refined it down to the overlap between the &#8216;idyllic&#8217; and &#8216;intrigue&#8217; and the natural tension between these two narratives.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/dixonbaxi.com\/uktv-drama-a-new-channel-brand-on-freeview\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DixonBaxi case study<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/drama_uktv_logo_detail.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Idents for Drama (TV) by DixonBaxi\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The D logo was created as a premium mark and punctuation for the brand. The two dimensional into 3D form and the play between light and shade is also a reference to the two sides to drama and in our case the idyllic and the intrigue.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/dixonbaxi.com\/uktv-drama-a-new-channel-brand-on-freeview\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DixonBaxi case study<\/a><\/h3>\n<p>Much like <a href=\"http:\/\/dixonbaxi.com\/uktv-yesterday-rebrand-2\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">their previous work for Yesterday<\/a>, another UKTV channel, DixonBaxi focuses on the channel&#8217;s initial letter with a heavy dollop of three-dimensionality. Luckily, they are very good at this and the purple-colored &#8220;D&#8221; has some sexy and killer curves accentuated with some dramatic lighting. It&#8217;s hard to tell what the actual 3D shape of the &#8220;D&#8221; is&hellip; some sort of half M&ouml;bius strip. The &#8220;DRAMA&#8221; wordmark is fine, although a little inconsistent with the &#8220;R&#8221; standing out too much and the &#8220;M&#8221; being the only letter having rounded corners.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"http:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/69188243?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=ffffff\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Full set of idents.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The 10 idents, 14 channel stings and graphics package elements take place in everyday, real life settings. Warm, familar, local. They feature a series of beautiful, cinematic single shots which in combination create a sense of drama &#8212; always seen through our lens. Although familiar scenes, they have a delicious ambiguity which plays on our tension between &#8216;idyllic&#8217; and &#8216;intrigue&#8217;. There is an edge, but it&#8217;s never dangerous or too foreboding. A gentle menace, a romantic yearning, a battle of wits. It&#8217;s still safe, lovable and enjoyable&#8230; with a twist.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/dixonbaxi.com\/uktv-drama-a-new-channel-brand-on-freeview\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DixonBaxi case study<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"http:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/69207379?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=ffffff\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>3-second &#8220;Stings&#8221; that tell a story using only two shots.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">The idents and stings are excellent, creating tiny little dramas that set the tone for the shows and give the channel some sort of grounding in the twenty-first century so that it doesn&#8217;t feel like you are always watching TV in the 1970s. I love the way the logo appears on the idents and how the shading animates, giving it a reason to exist beyond just decoration.
