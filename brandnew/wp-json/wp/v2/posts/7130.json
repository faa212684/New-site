They source their cacao beans from cooperatives and grower-centered organizations that focus on quality and sustainability that in turn work with the farmers themselves and come from countries like Peru, Dominican Republic, and Tanzania. One big difference with Raaka chocolates is that they skip the roasting process, going from bean to bar, which allows the final product to be less Milky Way and more true to the cacao and its origins. (To better understand their process and ogle at some chocolate-making photos see <a href=\"https:\/\/www.raakachocolate.com\/pages\/unroasted\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a>.) Their finished product is available in stores around New York and Whole Foods nationwide. Recently, Raaka introduced a new identity and packaging designed by Brooklyn-based <a href=\"https:\/\/trabuc.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Andrea Trabucco-Campos<\/a> and San Francisco, CA-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simonblockley.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Simon Blockley<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/raaka_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Raaka by Andrea Trabucco-Campos and Simon Blockley\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo had the right intention by adopting an organic, unfinished, and raw aesthetic but it may have leaned too hard into it, looking more like a scribble from the opening titles of <em>Se7en<\/em> than a tantalizing logo for delicious chocolate. The new logo maintains the basic structure of the old one but is beautifully rendered in a contemporary, single-thickness, script-like style that looks great. I would typically advocate for slight differences in repeating characters when it comes to script logos but, in this case, keeping the &#8220;a&#8221;s the same makes the logo stronger and more interesting as they yield a consistent rhythm. I also like how it almost looks like a font (and would pay good money to use it myself).<\/p>\n<blockquote>A long time ago, I had fallen in love with the lowercase &#8220;a&#8221; that I found on the cover of a book I collected by Stephen Rogers Peck. The typeface was Trooper Roman, which prompted me to look deeper into the genre with classics like Tom&#8217;s Roman, Times Modern and Perpetua Super. They share a heritage of editorial use,  maintaining an elegant tone.<br \/><br \/>Alku, Raaka&#8217;s new custom typeface, is an interpretation of this rich typographic genre for Raaka: starting from the lowercase &#8220;a&#8221; I loved, all the other shapes are harmonized with it. Alku is more condensed, with lowered contrast, optimized for setting the titles of each bar.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/trabuc.co\/Raaka\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Andrea Trabucco-Campos project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/raaka_custom_font_00.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Raaka by Andrea Trabucco-Campos and Simon Blockley\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/raaka_custom_font.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Raaka by Andrea Trabucco-Campos and Simon Blockley\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/raaka_custom_font.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Raaka by Andrea Trabucco-Campos and Simon Blockley\" \/>\n<figcaption>Custom font.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The custom serif is also great, building on the growing use of bold serifs while giving this one a unique flair in some of the characters.

As a bean-to-bar maker, we&#8217;re able to purchase cacao directly from farmer-owned cooperatives and grower centric organizations and establish meaningful, collaborative relationships with each one. But these relationships don&#8217;t fit the conventional certifications that most chocolate-loving folks are a familiar with, which can make telling, and therefore visualizing and contextualizing this story pretty challenging.<br \/><br \/>Lucky for us, Andrea and Simon were up for the challenge. They worked patiently and diligently with us to bring our new Transparent Trade model to life on the inside of every wrapper. Now, when someone opens up any Raaka bar, they can learn about the cacao producer we sourced the beans from, what we paid for them, how that stacks up against market prices, and what the supply chain between us and each grower looks like. We believe that the more we can educate customers about the cacao and chocolate supply chain and processes, the more we can create a positive, progressive, and equitable industry for all. That starts with transparency. That starts with us.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.raakachocolate.com\/pages\/new-look\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Raaka news page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/raaka_packaging_interior.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Raaka by Andrea Trabucco-Campos and Simon Blockley\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/raaka_packaging_interior_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Raaka by Andrea Trabucco-Campos and Simon Blockley\" \/>\n<figcaption>Interior wrap.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/raaka_packaging_bars.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Raaka by Andrea Trabucco-Campos and Simon Blockley\" \/>\n<figcaption>Deliciousness.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/raaka_packaging_hero.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Raaka by Andrea Trabucco-Campos and Simon Blockley\" \/>\n<figcaption>Hero shots.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/raaka_packaging_caps.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Raaka by Andrea Trabucco-Campos and Simon Blockley\" \/>\n<figcaption>Caps.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/raaka_staaf_stuff.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Raaka by Andrea Trabucco-Campos and Simon Blockley\" \/>\n<figcaption>Staff swag.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">The t-shirts and hats for the staff are fantastic too.
