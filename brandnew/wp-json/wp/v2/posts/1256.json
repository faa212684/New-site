Facing the challenge of being considered behind the times, the school recently changed to its current name from the previously old-fashioned moniker of Danmarks Biblioteksskole (Danish Library School) and introduced a complete new identity by Danish studio <a href=\"http:\/\/www.make.dk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Make<\/a>.<!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/IVA_ReBrand_Before_2.jpg\" alt=\"IVA\"><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/IVA_ReBrand_Before_3.jpg\" alt=\"IVA\"><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Sample materials of previous identity, including brochures, newspaper ads, stationery and printed matters.<\/p>\n<blockquote>A new visual identity was introduced in 2010 that captured the new brand positioning and name change. The brandmark was based on the Fibonacci sequence which is employed across the boundaries of art, science and mathematics. It was supported with a flexible visual system that incorporates imagery from the ever-expanding fields of human knowledge.<br \/>&mdash; Make project description<\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/iva_logo_variations.jpg\" alt=\"IVA\"><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/IVA_ReBrand_After_8.jpg\" alt=\"IVA\"><\/p>\n<p>An interesting aspect of this visual evolution is that it correlates with the perception of the practice of library sciences: Where the clich&eacute; is an old lady with thick glasses resolving dusty books and organizing indecipherable index cards, the reality is that library organization has become an increasingly complex and technologically innovative practice. In this regard, the overly governmental and academic look of the old identity is the kind of identity an institution in the twenty-first century wants to ditch.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/iva_pins_tote.jpg\" alt=\"IVA\"><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/iva_t-shirt.jpg\" alt=\"IVA\"><\/p>\n<p>Although I am generally wary of golden ratio- or Fibonacci sequence-inspired logos, this new identity has enough personality to stand on its own. It has a certain confidence to it, as if this logo had been in use for the last two decades. The imagery-holder technique has been done before and this one doesn&#8217;t offer anything particularly new &mdash; the awesome rainbow foil stamp version below notwithstanding &mdash; but it does manage to convey a certain connectivity between the real and the archived world. The typography is almost invisible, not calling too much attention to itself and just doing its job of stating the name and spelling out what the name stands for. The applications are varied and simple adding to that confident look. Overall, a definite improvement.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/iva_brochure.jpg\" alt=\"IVA\"><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/iva_brochure_03.jpg\" alt=\"IVA\"><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/iva_brochure_02.jpg\" alt=\"IVA\"><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/IVA_ReBrand_After_5.jpg\" alt=\"IVA\"><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_101202_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_101202_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_101202_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_101202_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,29,26],"tags":[397,179,105,398],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1256"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1256"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1256\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1256"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1256"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1256"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
