It is <a href=\"https:\/\/corporate.target.com\/article\/2018\/05\/new-brands-for-next-generation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the latest<\/a> in Target&#8217;s big-time investment in developing new, exclusive, in-house brands (like ones previously featured on Brand New: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_197.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Modern by Dwell<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/new_name_logo_and_packaging_for_a_new_day_by_collins.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A New Day<\/a>). Heyday offers over 150 products, in eye-catching colors, that include cell phone cases, headphones, speakers, and all kinds of cables and connectors. The new identity and packaging for Heyday has been designed by New York, NY- and San Francisco, CA-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wearecollins.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Collins<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>Target&#8217;s Creative Team invited COLLINS to develop the brand strategy, identity, and design program. Our goal was to expand Target&#8217;s relationship with their guests through new, high-quality products that addressed the need for novelty, simplicity, and joy.<br \/><br \/>Simple design and packaging framing the product&#8217;s vibrant colors, lively form, and inventive details were the answer. We wanted to help Target&#8217;s guests find more delight in the everyday products that connect them with friends and family. To help do that we&#8230;<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wearecollins.com\/work\/heyday\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Collins project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/heyday_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Heyday by Collins\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Based on what looks like Lineto&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/lineto.com\/The%20Fonts\/Font%20Categories\/Text%20Fonts\/Brown\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brown<\/a>, the new logo might not be a surprise to anyone, building on the avalanche of geometric sans wordmarks but it does offer one satisfying twist on the minimalist approach by using the same glyph for the &#8220;h&#8221; as the &#8220;y&#8221;s &#8212; taking the minimalism to an extreme but also cleverly maintaining all the characters in the logo with a round structure (whereas normally a &#8220;y&#8221; would introduce an angled character). Given the simplicity of the products, the logo could not have upstaged them in any way and a more peculiar icon emerged in the process anyway&#8230;<\/p>\n<blockquote>&#8230; We brought to life a new signature brand character, Heyday, and his now trademarked smile by anthropomorphizing an otherwise overlooked hang tab, giving the brand a lighthearted wink&#8230;<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wearecollins.com\/work\/heyday\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Collins project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/heyday_packaging_00.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Heyday by Collins\" \/>\n<figcaption>New hangtag.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>In the case of Heyday, all products are displayed hanging from a plastic tab on rods in a peg board (as opposed to sitting on shelves) and Collins has amusingly transformed the utilitarian device into the packaging&#8217;s most notable, memorable, and distinctive design element: a funky, weird, hang tab that smiles at you from every product. I can imagine this increased the production cost of the packaging so props to Target for taking the challenge on to produce these or, maybe at their scale, it doesn&#8217;t make a difference to their bottom line &#8212; still, it&#8217;s a great feature that sort of rewards physical shopping at a brick and mortar store.<\/p>\n<blockquote>&#8230; Created a playful packaging program that makes it easy for consumers to navigate and select their favorite products and options.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wearecollins.com\/work\/heyday\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Collins project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/heyday_packaging_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Heyday by Collins\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/heyday_packaging_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Heyday by Collins\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/heyday_packaging_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Heyday by Collins\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sample packaging, front and back.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The packaging is lovely and minimal in warm gray and white boxes accentuated by the logo in yellow. At first I wasn&#8217;t too keen on the color selection but based on the colors of the products it&#8217;s the one color that wasn&#8217;t in their inventory and the one color that stands out against the products and the gray backs. The typography throughout is fine, if perhaps a little too undesigned, especially with everything set in lowercase, it&#8217;s almost as if someone forgot to format it.<\/p>\n<blockquote>&#8230; Developed a new language of over 100 helpful iconographic symbols and icons to quickly communicate the benefits and features of each product.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wearecollins.com\/work\/heyday\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Collins project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/heyday_icon_set_a.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Heyday by Collins\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icon set.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/heyday_icon_set_on_packaging_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Heyday by Collins\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/heyday_icon_set_on_packaging_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Heyday by Collins\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icons on packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Lovely set of non-gratuitous icons!<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/heyday_logo_on_product_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Heyday by Collins\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/heyday_logo_on_product_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Heyday by Collins\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo on product.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/heyday_product_photography.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Heyday by Collins\" \/>\n<figcaption>Product\/model photography.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/heyday_packaging_groups_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Heyday by Collins\" \/>\n<figcaption>And more packaging shots&#8230;<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/heyday_packaging_groups_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Heyday by Collins\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/heyday_packaging_groups_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Heyday by Collins\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/heyday_packaging_groups_04.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Heyday by Collins\" \/>\n<figcaption>Packaging, non-stop.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">Overall, this is a great system that feels youthful and contemporary while being perfectly in tune with Target&#8217;s approach to exclusive brands that strike a solid balance of being attractive, covetable, and affordable.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Launched this Summer, Heyday is a new range of tech accessories and electronics designed by and available exclusively at Target.
