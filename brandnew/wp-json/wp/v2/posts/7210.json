Nicknamed Furac\u00e3o (&#8220;Hurricane&#8221; in English), it is not the winningest team in Brazil and has only won one league championship in 2001 but it did win 2018&#8217;s Copa Sudamericana, the second-most prestigious club competition in South American football. In December, the team introduced a new identity designed by S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ozdesign.com.br\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Oz<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/clube_athletico_paranense_logo_evolution.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Club Athletico Paranaense by Oz\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo evolution.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The new brand carries not only the history of the club, but all its differentials and aspirations for the future, resulting in a unique brand, unlike anything in Brazilian football currently.<br \/><br \/>We are looking for a design whose simplicity allows it to be reproduced from memory by any fan, unlike most traditional shields. This minimalism and graphic synthesis &#8211; eliminating unnecessary visual adornments &#8211; is a striking feature of international contemporary design.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.novamarcaatleticopr.com.br\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brand microsite (Google-translated)<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/clube_athletico_paranense_logo_concept.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Club Athletico Paranaense by Oz\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo concept.

Also that &#8220;C&#8221; was almost inexistent being so closely placed to the &#8220;A&#8221;. The new logo takes a more contemporary approach and breaks away from baroque lettering and circular badges to introduce a relatively more minimalist visual device that starts off in the shape of a shield but then breaks away by extending the lines upwards for a rare asymmetric design. It looks more like a wing than a hurricane but, in the end, it does communicate some kind of extreme motion. I don&#8217;t love it but I don&#8217;t hate it either&#8230; it&#8217;s fine. The &#8220;CAP&#8221; lettering could have been great if they had not added the extra little strokes, which only create visual noise and have no relation to anything else anywhere. The team&#8217;s name underneath is mostly fine. All three elements together, though, I&#8217;m not sure they are the most convincingly cohesive.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/clube_athletico_paranense_logo_animation.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Club Athletico Paranaense by Oz\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo animation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>I do dig this animation.

A proprietary typography is a powerful tool in building a solid identity, since all communications will be done in a personalized way.<br \/><br \/>In the case of Athletico Paranaense the importance is even greater. The main expression of identity of a football club is undoubtedly its uniform. The number on the back of the players therefore has a relevant role in the image. In this way it becomes a great differential the numbers have a unique design, different from those of all the opponents with which you will face in the field.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.novamarcaatleticopr.com.br\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brand microsite (Google-translated)<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/clube_athletico_paranense_font_01.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Club Athletico Paranaense by Oz\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/clube_athletico_paranense_font_02.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Club Athletico Paranaense by Oz\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/clube_athletico_paranense_font_03.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Club Athletico Paranaense by Oz\" \/>\n<figcaption>Custom font.

In general though, it&#8217;s a little awkward, and I keep thinking it&#8217;s more for a corporation than a soccer team. The numbers are kind of cool. I  wish they had instead turned the blackletter of &#8220;CAP&#8221; and &#8220;furac\u00e3o&#8221; into a full font.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/clube_athletico_paranense_uniforms_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Club Athletico Paranaense by Oz\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/clube_athletico_paranense_uniforms_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Club Athletico Paranaense by Oz\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/clube_athletico_paranense_uniforms_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Club Athletico Paranaense by Oz\" \/>\n<figcaption>Uniforms.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The uniforms look fine. The logo works nicely in the corner and the big stripes are a good extension of the shield.
