The company was founded in 2007 by Betsy &amp; Bryan Babcock at their farm-stay B&amp;B in Franklin, NY with a flock of 5 hens. Guest at the B&amp;B consistently praised the delicious taste of the eggs they served at breakfast. Betsy &amp; Bryan realized that their eggs were tastier because their hens got to roam open pasture, foraging and grazing. Before long, Betsy &amp; Bryan began collecting similarly raised eggs from their friends and neighbors to package and sell them to local stores. As demand grew, Handsome Brook Farm built a network of small farms in the local Amish and Mennonite community to supply eggs. From this perch, the company hatched its core values: ethical treatment of animals, fair treatment of farmers, affordable pricing and sustainable agriculture. These principles remain critical to the company today. While the original B&amp;B is now closed, the company&#8217;s farm network has grown to include more than 70 small family farms from New York to Oklahoma. Handsome Brook Farm is currently the best-selling organic pasture raised egg in the U.S. and is available at more than 3,500 points of sale nationally.&#8221;<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/handsome_brook_farms_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Handsome Brook Farms by Redscout\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/handsome_brook_farms_logo_on_egg.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Handsome Brook Farms by Redscout\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo on egg.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\" style=\"background:black\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/handsome_brook_farms_logo_on_video.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo on video.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/handsome_brook_farms_business_cards.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Handsome Brook Farms by Redscout\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.
