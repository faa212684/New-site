After a couple of years of research, development, and testing, Dreem is now a consumer platform offering the <a href=\"https:\/\/dreem.com\/en\/product\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dreem Band<\/a>, a lightweight headband &#8212; designed by <a href=\"https:\/\/fuseproject.com\/work\/rythm\/dreem\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fuseproject<\/a>, who designed it to &#8220;feel like loungewear instead of tech&#8221; &#8212; that uses sensors to track your sleep and bone conduction to flow music, at a cost of half of an iPhone X, providing fresh analytics every morning. Aiming to become a consumer brand, Dreem introduced this month a new identity designed by London, UK-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.venturethree.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">venturethree<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>Built on the ambition to &#8220;wake the world up to sleep&#8221;, the brand challenges the traditional perception of sleep as a passive activity, empowering us to take action and reap the rewards as we wake up to brighter, healthier lives. With a simple, contemporary feel, the brand translates Dreem&#8217;s deep understanding of neuroscience and technology into a bright, optimistic human experience.<\/blockquote><h3>venturethree provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/dreem_brand_position.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Dreem by venturethree\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brand positioning.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The identity, with bespoke letterforms and a wave symbol inspired by &#8220;pink noise&#8221;, blends technological precision with the beautiful impact sleep has in our lives. With active photography, a bright colour palette and a bold and uplifting tone of voice, the brand breaks with convention to showcase sleep as a dynamic, life-enhancing experience everyone can get better at.<\/blockquote><h3>venturethree provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/dreem_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Dreem by venturethree\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video controls controlsList=\"nodownload\" poster=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/dreem_logo_animation.jpg\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/dreem_logo_animation.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo animation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/dreem_logo_expressions.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Dreem by venturethree\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/dreem_logo_expressions_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Dreem by venturethree\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo expressions.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo was fine for a non-consumer brand and it had a slightly creepy, <em>Black Mirror<\/em>-esque evil corporation look with the cryptic &#8220;E&#8221;s facing each other that would have not engendered the highest degree of consumer trust or desirability. The new logo is quite good, introducing a wavy &#8220;m&#8221; as its identifying device &#8212; a nice metaphor for the wave-like pattern of people&#8217;s sleep. When used in the wordmark, the &#8220;m&#8221; turns the otherwise minimalist geometric sans serif into something more interesting and memorable, integrating the funky letterform quite well with the rest of the characters. On its own, it becomes a groovy abstract icon that, for now, holds no recognizability or equity, but depending on the product&#8217;s popularity has the potential to become if not Apple&#8217;s apple perhaps at least Zune&#8217;s &#8220;Z&#8221;. I like how it works in both instances and I&#8217;ll admit that I&#8217;m a sucker for the red-to-hot-pink gradient and both the full logo and icon look great on it.<\/p>\n<blockquote>The challenge for the brand was twofold. In the first instance, how do you convince people to let a &#8216;brain company&#8217; yielding complex neuroscience enter one of the most intimate aspects of our lives? Secondly, how can we credibly cut through the clutter and apathy created by an exploding sleep category full of gimmicks and empty promises? The answer was finding a balance. Balance between scientific conviction and human empathy, between disrupting everyday behaviour whilst promising the calm sleep brings to our lives. Sleep is a truly complex problem, so we built the Dreem brand around a beautifully simple proposition and story: be better at sleep and wake up to a brighter, healthier, happier tomorrow.&#8221;<\/blockquote><h3>venturethree provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/dreem_ads.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Dreem by venturethree\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/dreem_ads_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Dreem by venturethree\" \/>\n<figcaption>Ads.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/dreem_hero_photo_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Dreem by venturethree\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/dreem_hero_photo_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Dreem by venturethree\" \/>\n<figcaption>Product\/model photography.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/dreem_app.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Dreem by venturethree\" \/>\n<figcaption>App.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/dreem_product.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Dreem by venturethree\" \/>\n<figcaption>Product and app.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The ads and photography do a great job in presenting this in an as-non-threatening-, non-invasive-as-possible way, with an interesting use of light gray backgrounds (which we don&#8217;t see often, if you think about it), muted photography (with lovely touches of hot pink on the edges of the product or the models), and non-shout-y typography treatments.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video controls controlsList=\"nodownload\" poster=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/dreem_brand_animation.jpg\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/dreem_brand_animation.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Identity presentation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">This is an extremely hard product to brand as it&#8217;s not the kind of attractive tech you &#8220;wear&#8221; in public &#8212; from expensive Beats to the iPhone to your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/new_logo_for_palm.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">phone&#8217;s phone<\/a> &#8212; and the idea of wearing something on your head all night, every night isn&#8217;t the most appealing.
