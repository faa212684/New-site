At age 18, he moved to New York City to attend Parsons School of Design. In 2005, after two years at Parsons, he decided to pursue the launch of his own fashion label, which predominantly began with a knitwear collection. In Fall 2007, Wang presented a complete women&#8217;s ready-to-wear collection on the New York catwalk for the first time, to critical acclaim.  His lines are now stocked globally in more than 700 stores and other venues. Wang launched his full women&#8217;s collection in 2007; the collections are selling to over 700 stores worldwide, and the brand has 16 stores in 7 countries.&#8221; (<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Alexander_Wang_(designer)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wikipedia<\/a>)<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/alexander_wang_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo for Alexander Wang\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/alexander_wang_logo_animation_01.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<hr \/>\n<div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/alexander_wang_logo_animation_02.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<hr \/>\n<div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/alexander_wang_logo_animation_03.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo animations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/alexander_wang_cover_image.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Alexander Wang\" \/>\n<figcaption>Triple-a treatment.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/alexander_wang_collection_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Alexander Wang\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/alexander_wang_collection_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Alexander Wang\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/alexander_wang_collection_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Alexander Wang\" \/>\n<figcaption>Images from a new collection.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/alexander_wang_backdrop.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Alexander Wang\" \/>\n<figcaption>Backdrop.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"(Est. 2005) &quot;Alexander Wang (born December 26, 1983) is an American fashion designer.
