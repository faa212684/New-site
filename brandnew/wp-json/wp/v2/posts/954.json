The uiversity has been named after Carl Linnaeus, an eighteenth century naturalist and physician, who is widely credited as the father of modern taxonomy (and apparently, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sciencedaily.com\/releases\/2009\/06\/090616080137.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the inventor of the index card<\/a>). The new identity has been designed by (one of my favorite design firms) <a href=\"http:\/\/www.stockholmdesignlab.se\/#\/1112\/library\/clients\/linnaeus-university\/linnaeus-university\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Stockholm Design Lab<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/linnaeus_wordmark.gif\" alt=\"Linnaeus University Wordmark\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Swedish, above, and English wordmarks.<\/p>\n<p>As the designers explain on their web site, the icon is inspired by a sketch that Linnaeus had made on one of his earliest publications. The result is what I can only call an optimistic tree. It is rendered very simply and abstractly, it could be a leafy tree or it could be an apple tree, but either way it feels like it&#8217;s bursting. If I had one complaint it would be the way the trunk connects with the top-left circle, which makes it look like an ornament. The way it is used on the web site, small, gives it a certain seriousness. The typography is simple and impeccable and I love how in the Swedish version the accent over the &#8220;e&#8221; is replaced by a dot instead of an actual accent, giving it a nice rhythm. And I am a sucker for the &aelig; ligature, so it&#8217;s nice to see it make an appearance in the English version. Judging from the web site alone, this is a highly sophisticated and contemporary identity and I&#8217;m sure print and other applications will be equally fruitful.<\/a>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to Urban Gustavsson for the tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_20091023_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_20091023_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"574\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,29,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/954"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=954"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/954\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=954"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=954"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=954"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
