At the request of friends, our family started cooking up a few stockpots of homemade banana pepper mustard to share. The hand packed jars went quickly, with smiles all around, and it wasn&#8217;t long until the idea formed to sell our unique sauce through local specialty stores. The response was overwhelming. Word of the spicy and sweet creation grew quickly in Butler County and beyond, as did sales. We soon found ourselves driving daily throughout Western Pennsylvania to deliver yesterday&#8217;s batch. It was clear we had something people had been looking for &#8212; a tangy and spicy condiment with a balance rarely found in a pepper sauce. Over fifteen years later, Miller&#8217;s award-winning banana pepper mustard is still crafted with the same care and attention to detail as when we first made it for our friends. From local concession stands to national grocery chains, our undeniable passion for making a quality condiment with spirit and versatility continues.&#8221;<\/p><!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/millers_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Miller&amp;apos;s by Hampton Hargreaves\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/millers_logo_alternate.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Miller&amp;apos;s by Hampton Hargreaves\" \/>\n<figcaption>Badge.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/millers_packaging_before_after.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Miller&amp;apos;s by Hampton Hargreaves\" \/>\n<figcaption>Packaging, before and after.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/millers_packaging_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Miller&amp;apos;s by Hampton Hargreaves\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/millers_packaging_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Miller&amp;apos;s by Hampton Hargreaves\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/millers_packaging_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Miller&amp;apos;s by Hampton Hargreaves\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/millers_packaging_04.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Miller&amp;apos;s by Hampton Hargreaves\" \/>\n<figcaption>New packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/millers_business_cards.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Miller&amp;apos;s by Hampton Hargreaves\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/millers_letterhead.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Miller&amp;apos;s by Hampton Hargreaves\" \/>\n<figcaption>Letterhead.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/millers_buttons.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Miller&amp;apos;s by Hampton Hargreaves\" \/>\n<figcaption>Buttons.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/millers_tshirt.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Miller&amp;apos;s by Hampton Hargreaves\" \/>\n<figcaption>T-shirt.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/millers_tote.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Miller&amp;apos;s by Hampton Hargreaves\" \/>\n<figcaption>Tote bag.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"&quot;Miller&apos;s began in 2002 as a humble experiment.
