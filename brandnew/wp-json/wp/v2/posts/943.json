Since then, along with the explosion in popularity of professional car racing, ISC has become one of the most intrinsic organizations of this sport, owning thirteen major motorsports arenas in the U.S. This week they introduced a new logo that replaces a 12-year-old, going-on-fifty logo.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/isc_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"ISC Logo, Detail\" \/><\/p>\n<blockquote>&#8220;As the leading promoter of major motorsports entertainment, we felt it was time to refresh and modernize our corporate logo while maintaining certain attributes of the previous version to reflect our proud heritage,&#8221; stated ISC Chief Executive Officer Lesa France Kennedy. &#8220;The new logo reflects the Company&#8217;s continuing growth and innovation in motorsports entertainment.&#8221;<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/ir.iscmotorsports.com\/phoenix.zhtml?c=113983&#038;p=irol-newsArticle&#038;ID=1338657&#038;highlight=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press Release<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p>For a company that hosts a good amount of a sport worth billions of dollars, the old logo was unacceptable by any given standard. It was unprofessional, unsightly and, to a certain degree, unreadable. The new logo isn&#8217;t anything that will earn a place in the canon of identity design, far from it, but it&#8217;s at least professional, moderate to see and readable. In fact, it would have been quite an improvement had the designers held back in the unnecessary gradient that swooshes across the icon. The typography is simple and strong &mdash; although I would have gone with monoweight letterforms &mdash; and the icon is a decent evolution of the previous one, even if the spacing in the frame is too thin. With a few more pushes in execution this could have been a great redesign.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to Dak Dillon for the tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_20091008_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_20091008_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"574\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,26,87],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/943"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=943"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/943\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=943"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=943"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=943"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
