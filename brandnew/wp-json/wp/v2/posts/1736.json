Last known as DnB NOR, from the 2003 merger of Den norske Bank (DnB) and Gjensidige NOR, DNB currently has more than 2.3 million retail customers and over 200,000 corporate customers with 200 locations across the country. A first peek at the new logo was released earlier this year in June with <a href=\"http:\/\/static.e24.no\/drpublish\/images\/article\/2011\/06\/09\/20066993\/1\/590\/104649.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this unfortunately dopey picture<\/a> but the official release of the new identity was earlier this month. The identity has been designed by Oslo-based <a href=\"http:\/\/anti-ink.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Anti<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/xn--snhettadesign-cnb.no\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sn&oslash;hetta Design<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>The bank in one line: DNB, the bank for all of Norway.

If anything, it seemed too aloof and contemporary for a bank of this size. When I first saw the new logo I thought it was particularly bland and basic. I still think it&#8217;s a little underdeveloped but the application gives it a little push. It&#8217;s not extremely exciting, but there is a nice visual consistency achieved through the extension of the lines of the &#8220;N&#8221; that works much better in the context of bigger pieces where the logo can bleed than it does in the static logo. I also like the teal color selection that provides a serious and sophisticated look. I am guessing the image of the building above is just a Photoshop rendering but that&#8217;s a great extension (pun intended) of the logo. Overall, a definite improvement.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to Aleksander Rist for first tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_111128_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_111128_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_111128_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_111128_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,37,26],"tags":[441,481,42,645],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1736"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1736"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1736\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1736"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1736"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1736"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
