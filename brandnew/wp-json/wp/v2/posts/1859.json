Jaguar is part of Jaguar Land Rover, which in turn is owned by Tata Motors. This week, Jaguar introduced a new marketing campaign created by Spark44 &mdash; a communications agency owned in part by Jaguar Land Rover &mdash; that &#8220;is driven by the belief that Jaguar makes the world&#8217;s most instinctively rewarding performance cars,&#8221; and aims &#8220;to increase awareness of the brand amongst a new audience in line with the brand&#8217;s ambitious future plans.&#8221; With it came a revised logo and corporate typeface.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>The campaign, created with Spark 44, the international communications agency that&#8217;s part-owned by Jaguar Land Rover, will feature print, TV, digital advertising and a new look that contemporizes the aesthetics of the brand at every customer touch point. The Jaguar brand will have new corporate identification and a new font, created exclusively for the brand. The dramatic alteration, including significant changes to the brand symbols of the &#8220;leaper&#8221; and &#8220;growler,&#8221; is the most extensive change Jaguar has made to its visual identification in 40 years.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jaguar.com\/us\/en\/about_jaguar\/news_pr\/jna_alive_press_release\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press Release<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/jaguar_logo_detail.jpg\" alt=\"Jaguar\" \/><\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"574\" height=\"292\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/OyoL_IsLpwM\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">New &#8220;Machines&#8221; TV spot.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/jaguar_ad.jpg\" alt=\"Jaguar\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">New print ad. Such a dumb, trite concept.<\/p>\n<p>I have always liked the Jaguar logo, for no particular reason other than it&#8217;s well executed, seems well managed, and it&#8217;s never tried too hard. With this last version it is trying <em>so<\/em> hard to be cool and relevant it&#8217;s become annoying and, worse, noticeable. Not so much in the jaguar itself, or &#8220;Leaper&#8221;, which has always featured some kind of metal finishing, but in the typography. Whereas the previous wordmark looked like a luxury, fashion-line brand, the new one has lost all sophistication in exchange for an overly extended, industrial look that cheapens its appearance. It reminds me of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.google.com\/search?client=safari&#038;rls=en&#038;q=dodge+logo&#038;oe=UTF-8&#038;um=1&#038;ie=UTF-8&#038;hl=en&#038;tbm=isch&#038;source=og&#038;sa=N&#038;tab=wi&#038;ei=hhhOT5SBLOjisQK_2Lwg&#038;biw=1289&#038;bih=585&#038;sei=ihhOT5XvIOXpsQLThpz6Dw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the Dodge logo<\/a>, which I don&#8217;t associate with hundred-thousand-dollar cars. The sample of print advertising I found does not help their cause either: I mean, seriously, a sonogram? They seem to have lost track of their audience or what a luxury brand should look and talk like. The TV spot is more successful in establishing Jaguar as an integral part of innovation and industrial evolution as well as defining a slightly edgier personality. Overall, there is a lot of confused messaging and execution. I won&#8217;t be buying a Jaguar anytime soon &hellip; not out of principle of their poor branding but because I can&#8217;t afford it.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_120229_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_120229_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_120229_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_120229_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_120229_config_03.xml&#038;xyz=poll_120229_votes_03.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv3\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv3\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[59,9,26],"tags":[694,695,42],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1859"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1859"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1859\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1859"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1859"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1859"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
