They are one of four candidate cities alongside Paris, France; and Rome, Italy respectively. Los Angeles was chosen by the United States Olympic Committee on August 28, 2015 after the Los Angeles City Council voted unanimously to back the bid. This is the second city that has been submitted by the USOC for the 2024 Summer Olympics. Boston, Massachusetts was originally chosen to be the American bid, but withdrew on July 27, 2015 due to potential cost overruns. Los Angeles also originally bid for the USOC&#8217;s nomination in late 2014, when Boston was chosen over Los Angeles, Washington, DC, and San Francisco.&#8221; (<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Los_Angeles_bid_for_the_2024_Summer_Olympics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wikipedia<\/a>)<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/los_angeles_2024_bid_city_logo.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for LA 2024 Candidate City by 72andSunny\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/los_angeles_2024_bid_city_logo_grid.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for LA 2024 Candidate City by 72andSunny\" \/>\n<figcaption>Underlying grid, taken from video below.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/c182Pzlae5I\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo unveil video.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"&quot;The Los Angeles bid for the 2024 Summer Olympics and Summer Paralympics is an ongoing attempt to bring the 2024 Summer Olympics to the city of Los Angeles.
