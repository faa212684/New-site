They have launched with two buildings, one near Madrid and the other not so near in A Coru\u00f1a, with the goal of selling 2,000 residences each year by 2019 and starting with the capital to build 7,000 residences across Spain. One key thing for our non-Spanish speaking audience: the name dospuntos is &#8220;dos puntos&#8221; joined together and dos puntos is how the colon punctuation mark (:) is called in Spanish, literally two dots (or more grammatically correct, two periods &#8212; the semicolon we call &#8220;punto y coma&#8221;, period and a comma). The new identity has been designed by the Madrid office of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.brandunion.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brand Union<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>The visual identity uses different iconic and relevant elements, that along with the logotype, build a differentiating look and feel, supporting the strategy and business approach:<br \/>\n&#8211;  A logotype that is relevant but as direct and self-explanatory as possible<br \/>\n&#8211;  An iconic and flexible graphic device &#8211; our own &#8220;floor plan&#8221;, articulates our visual communication<br \/>\n&#8211;  A colour palette that has three main colours building consistency but also flexibility, attending to different locations and customer profiles, as well as being differential from competitors<br \/>\n&#8211;  A typographic family that enables our conversation with our customers and partners, less corporate and more editorial, as we want to speak, but also to listen to them<br \/>\n&#8211;  A full range of icons, a defined image style&#8230; all building in the same direction: a specific personality that defines us<\/blockquote><h3>Brand Union provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/dos_puntos_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for dospuntos by Brand Union\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail, with tagline &#8220;Decide your Home&#8221;.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video controls><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/dos_puntos_logo_animation.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo animation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The colon name is a clever choice and the company does a good job in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dospuntos.casa\/nuestra-marca\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">rationalizing it<\/a> as it marking the start of a conversation or as the jumping for a list of wishes when it comes to one&#8217;s home, as in &#8220;My favorite neighborhoods are:&#8221;, &#8220;I want my house to have:&#8221;, etc. The logo &#8212; with the first &#8220;o&#8221; in the logo jumping on top of the second &#8220;o&#8221; to form a colon, leaving the &#8220;d&#8221; hanging loose &#8212; is quite daring, not because it&#8217;s edgy or controversial but because it sacrifices readability and takes a gamble that, gasp, the audience is smart enough to get it. This is one of those logos that ends up in <em><a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/29WUzLh\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A Smile in the Mind<\/a><\/em> because it takes a chance, it makes a visual connection that brings a spark of joy to your world. I think it&#8217;s a brilliant logo, especially bold as an introductory logo to a company just launching. This is another case where a geometric sans serif serves the concept and purpose and where the use of lowercase helps with the readability by keeping all the characters more uniform.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/dos_puntos_stationery.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for dospuntos by Brand Union\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stationery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/dos_puntos_folder.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for dospuntos by Brand Union\" \/>\n<figcaption>Folder detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/dos_puntos_moleskine.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for dospuntos by Brand Union\" \/>\n<figcaption>Journal.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/dos_puntos_tote.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for dospuntos by Brand Union\" \/>\n<figcaption>Tote.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The identity introduces a thick floor plan graphic that, although I see its relevance, is very heavy-handed and lacks some sophistication or better execution. It&#8217;s like it&#8217;s there but not there, and maybe there are some walls maybe not, and maybe it serves as a frame or maybe not, and lines just stick in from the edges&#8230; Not very convincing. The introduction of a serif helps add a different tune to the system but they also went heavy-handed by using it extra large and it&#8217;s as if everything is competing for your attention.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/dos_puntos_print_ads.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for dospuntos by Brand Union\" \/>\n<figcaption>Print ads.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/dos_puntos_billboard.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for dospuntos by Brand Union\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/dos_puntos_outdoor_ad.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for dospuntos by Brand Union\" \/>\n<figcaption>Outdoor ads. (LOL at the creeper dog.)<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Perhaps the best case scenarios are the different ads above, particularly the mini billboard with the two &#8220;o&#8221;s from the logo specifying the location of the residence. But still, too many random thick black lines for my taste.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/dos_puntos_office_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for dospuntos by Brand Union\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/dos_puntos_office_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for dospuntos by Brand Union\" \/>\n<figcaption>Office.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/dos_puntos_welcome_matt.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for dospuntos by Brand Union\" \/>\n<figcaption>Welcome mat.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">The office graphics show commitment to the system by having large serif typography in its walls and this could have been really cool but I think they got carried away by size matters and everything is big and oversized. Overall, I love the logo and the color palette is convincing but the applications suffered from over-designing or designing in the wrong direction. I mean, this is not bad by any means, we&#8217;ve seen worse, but with such a strong cornerstone in the logo I wish that sense of surprise carried through.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Launched this year, dospuntos is a new residential real estate developer in Spain with the premise (and promise) to do things differently and with a new generation of home-owners in mind.
