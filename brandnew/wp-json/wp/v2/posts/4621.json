It has a festiveness that most logos in general try to avoid in part because, sure, it can seem childish or not serious enough but in this case it works to convey the celebration aspect of the Olympics. At first, I thought the human figure in the center was meant to be an athlete celebrating but it&#8217;s a depiction of the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Liberty_Statue_(Budapest)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Freedom Statue<\/a>, which makes it work even better as it shows a landmark locals (and previous visitors) will recognize while still conveying a victory-esque message, similar to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/new_logo_for_la_2024_candidate_city_by_72andsunny.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LA2024<\/a>. The depiction of the Danube underneath is effective and the one distinctive element of Budapest you would expect to show up. The idea of making the logo out of pieces of the Olympic rings is very clever.<\/p>\n<p>Execution-wise&#8230; I&#8217;m torn. I like the overall vibe and it&#8217;s very different from the other 2024 candidate city logos (see image at end of post) but I wish it were less Adobe Illustrator-y. Especially in the river lines, you can feel the jarring cuts&#8230; It&#8217;s, like, you can&#8217;t get your full Gestalt on.
