This past September BBYO introduced a new identity designed by Washington D.C.-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.levinedc.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Levine &amp; Associates<\/a>.<\/p><!--more-->\n<blockquote>The refreshed BBYO brand &#8212; an updated logo along with the release of the organization&#8217;s new five-year strategic plan &#8212; was launched this week. The logo&#8217;s design, says Portnoy, is meant to convey a &#8220;sense of tradition with modernity.&#8221; The iconic menorah symbol was maintained, while asymmetrical lengths were added to the branches and heights of the flames to convey individuality through self-exploration.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jta.org\/news\/article\/2011\/09\/22\/3089536\/estee-portnoy-wants-bbyo-to-be-like-mike\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">From article on Estee Portnoy, chairman of BBYO&#8217;s board of directors and business manager and spokeswoman for Michael Jordan<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bbyo_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"BBYO\" \/><\/p>\n<p>For a teen-focused organization the old logo was the equivalent of taking a teen&#8217;s phone and chewing gum away and stuffing him or her in a room watching C-SPAN. Its use of the Menorah &mdash; one of the more well-known symbols of Judaism, a candelabrum with 7 arms, one for each day of the week &mdash; as the &#8220;Y&#8221; was slightly clever but mostly awkward. It also emphasized the distinction between BB (B&#8217;nai B&#8217;rith, the organization that used to run it) and YO (Youth Organization) and now that BBYO is independent it didn&#8217;t help to have that visual distinction. The new logo is a great evolution, especially the icon with its asymmetric (yet symmetric) approach that gives the otherwise static object some dynamism. The typography isn&#8217;t particularly good and shaping the top of the &#8220;b&#8221;s like the flames is a little too cute for me, but it&#8217;s not terrible.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bbyo_type.gif\" alt=\"BBYO\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bbyo_color_palette.gif\" alt=\"BBYO\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bbyo_brochures.jpg\" alt=\"BBYO\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The applications for brochures and flyers are very teen-ish. Doesn&#8217;t get me very excited, but I&#8217;m not the target audience and I feel like anything that tries to be cool, as this is, ends up looking a little flat in the eyes of teens. But the system is solid and seems adaptable to BBYO. I do have to give props for the choice of an off-the-beaten-path typeface selection in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.typesupply.com\/portfolio\/typefaces\/torque\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Torque<\/a>, it&#8217;s the one element that gives this identity some edge.
