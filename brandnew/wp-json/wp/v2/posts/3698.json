Grabbitt&#8217;s core idea is acquisition, so we created a personified logotype where the i is grabbing the tt. This ligature and ownable naming device will unify all their future products. The iconography helps illustrate the different acquisitions and also adds playfulness to the brand&#8217;s voice.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/dia.tv\/grabbitt\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DIA project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/grabbitt_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Grabbitt by DIA\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/grabbitt_logo_animation.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Grabbitt by DIA\" \/>\n<figcaption>Ligature animation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/grabbitt_logo_variations.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Grabbitt by DIA\" \/>\n<figcaption>Name variations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo already had the ligature idea in place but was very haphazardly done and had a very weird F1-racing-like icon above.
