The former houses a collection of varied items from around the world including drawings by Picasso and Matisse and the latter focuses on Canadian art.

The <a href=\"http:\/\/jmbgallery.ca\/JMBWeb\/RELEASE%20-%20Art%20Museum%20launch.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">press release<\/a> says their &#8220;identities will be sustained within the larger institution&#8221; but I&#8217;m not sure if they mean &#8220;identities&#8221; literally as in keeping the logos or metaphorically as is in keeping the names.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The museum sought a new brand identity that would emphasize its placement within the city and its engagement with both the university community and greater Toronto public. [We] created a brand identity program that is built upon an angled logo and functions across a range of promotional collateral including brochures, programs, posters, banners and a website. The logo is set at the same 16.7 degree as the street grid of Toronto, firmly situating the museum in its Toronto location.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/underlinestudio.com\/art-museum-university-of-toronto\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Underline project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/art_museum_toronto_logo.png\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, Identity for Art Museum at the University of Toronto by Underline Studio\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/art_museum_toronto_logo_animation.gif\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, Identity for Art Museum at the University of Toronto by Underline Studio\" \/>\n<figcaption>Angle explanation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The new logo is typeset in a slightly obscure choice of Neubau&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/neubauladen.com\/product\/nb-international-pro\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NB International Pro<\/a> that has the plainness of Helvetica from afar but reveals more personality up front, which is good as the logo is regularly used large in the applications. The logo is placed at an angle that matches that of Toronto&#8217;s grid, a clever idea that helps add some more interest to an otherwise dry logo. The left leg of the &#8220;A&#8221; is <em>almost<\/em> straight and I wonder if it would have made sense to modify it slightly so that it sits at a perfectly vertical angle. Also, the bottom left corner of the &#8220;A&#8221; should have aligned with the top left corner of the &#8220;M&#8221;. It&#8217;s so close it looks like an oversight.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s interesting that the logo only goes by &#8220;Art Museum&#8221; instead of its full name of &#8220;Art Museum at the University of Toronto&#8221;. It&#8217;s a bold move&#8230; kind of like a hamburger joint just being named &#8220;Hamburger Joint&#8221;. &#8220;Art Museum&#8221; sounds like a category more than a specific place. I&#8217;m not saying it&#8217;s bad, it&#8217;s just interesting and surprising.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/art_museum_toronto_materials_all.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, Identity for Art Museum at the University of Toronto by Underline Studio\" \/>\n<figcaption>Various materials.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/art_museum_toronto_business_cards.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, Identity for Art Museum at the University of Toronto by Underline Studio\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/art_museum_toronto_showroom_exhibit.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, Identity for Art Museum at the University of Toronto by Underline Studio\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brochure for inaugural exhibition, &#8220;Showroom&#8221;.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/art_museum_toronto_brochures.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, Identity for Art Museum at the University of Toronto by Underline Studio\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brochures.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/art_museum_toronto_signage.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, Identity for Art Museum at the University of Toronto by Underline Studio\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/art_museum_toronto_signage_door.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, Identity for Art Museum at the University of Toronto by Underline Studio\" \/>\n<figcaption>Signage.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">The applications have a deadpan simplicity broken only by the angled logo, which is enough of a visual approach to establish a distinguishing identity for the organization. What really makes the identity work, though, is the color palette that provides a literally vibrant energy to the materials and stands apart from the more typical black and white coloring of museums. Overall, this is a pleasing identity with potential for a range of engaging applications based on the angle of the logo (or other elements down the road).<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established this past January, 2016, the Art Museum at the University of Toronto is a new institution that combines the existing Justina M.
