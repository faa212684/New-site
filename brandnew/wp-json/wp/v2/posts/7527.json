The concept that the height variations are based on the height of kids as they grow makes it all the more endearing and the surprise that the letters turn into a small and less-small kid holding hands is a delight. Neither wordmark nor icon are exactly &#8220;pretty&#8221; but they have more personality than most pretty logos out there.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bokino_identity_elements.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Boki\u00f1o by Bedow\" \/>\n<figcaption>Identity elements.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bokino_color_palette.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Boki\u00f1o by Bedow\" \/>\n<figcaption>Color palette.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>Using social media as their primary channel it was important to find a visual element that is easily recognizable, flexible and communicates books.

Sure, this isn&#8217;t the identity for a corporation or product on a shelf, with a huge responsibility, but even if a small hint of this kind of playfulness seeps into projects like that, it would be a win.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Launched this year, Boki\u00f1o is a new digital platform for children&apos;s books created to serve as a source of inspiration for parents and everyone else who is looking for children&apos;s and youth books for kids up to 12 years old&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[12,82,26],"tags":[262,462,311,855,224,530],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7527"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=7527"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7527\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=7527"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=7527"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=7527"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
