Gemini has been created by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, aka the Winklevoss twins, of not-Facebook fame, who&#8217;ve most recently been part of the venture capital world through <a href=\"https:\/\/winklevosscapital.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Winklevoss Capital<\/a>. I&#8217;m not even going  to attempt to explain <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bitcoin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bitcoin<\/a> &mdash; perhaps try this <a href=\"http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Bitcoin\/comments\/1xd9bk\/whats_your_best_elevator_pitch_for_bitcoin\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Reddit thread<\/a> on summarizing it as an elevator pitch (&#8220;It is nerd gold&#8221;!) &mdash; but the main gist is that it&#8217;s virtual money with a lot of potential in value and usability (even though you can&#8217;t purchase more Candy Crush lives with it). The problem with bitcoin is that it has suffered from very shady business practices and a Deep Internet vibe, which Cameron Winklevoss touches on in this <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.gemini.com\/welcome-to-gemini\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">introductory blog post<\/a> to Gemini. This is where these two gentleman come in, providing an assured presence and a trusted name, which even applies to their <a href=\"https:\/\/winkdex.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">WinkDex<\/a>, an index of global bitcoin pricing. Long story short, with the announcement came the introduction of their identity, designed by New York, NY-based <a href=\"http:\/\/gemini.bighuman.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Big Human<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>To the surprise of no one, the name Gemini was inspired by the fact that the founders of the exchange are twins. However, what made it really stick was this broader idea of partnership, which is an essential quality of any trading platform. For an exchange to happen, a partnership must be made.<br \/><br \/>We rode this theme into the design of the symbol as well. The symbol is a concise illustration of two &#8216;coins&#8217; intersecting to create a third space in the middle. The resulting image is a classic 1+1=3 analogy, reminiscent of partnership. This concept is reinforced when animated, as all it takes is two lines intersecting to create the symbol.<\/blockquote><h3>Big Human provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/gemini_logo_animation.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Gemini by Big Human\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo animation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/gemini_logo_lockups.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Gemini by Big Human\" \/>\n<figcaption>Lock-up and color alternatives.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The name Gemini is definitely appropriate given that it&#8217;s Latin for &#8220;twins&#8221; and has all sorts of metaphorical yarns to spin with. The logo has a nice simplicity to it, starting with the line icon made out of two intersecting coins, looking almost like an abstract Zodiac sign (of which Gemini is one of) as well as an infinity symbol. It&#8217;s very buttoned up and serious, able to play in the financial world without a hitch. The wordmark, in what looks like a slightly modified (extended) Gotham, does nothing more or less of what it&#8217;s supposed to do, i.e., spell out the name. The logo is both appealing and unexciting. The latter not meant as an insult.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/gemini_icons.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Gemini by Big Human\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icons.

We felt this was a necessary addition due to the fact that Gemini bridges the gap between the forward-thinking tech world and Wall Street.<\/blockquote><h3>Big Human provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/gemini_poster_ad_small.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Gemini by Big Human\" \/>\n<figcaption>Poster.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">Not much in terms of application. The presence of the company, through their website and the one mock-up ad above, indicates this is going to be very business-y, very serious, with a touch of techie vibe to convey that this is indeed not your grandparent&#8217;s stock exchange.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Announced last month, Gemini will be the first bitcoin exchange-traded fund in the U.S., fully regulated by and compliant with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and based in New York.
