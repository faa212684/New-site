Today, Ricard is the number one best-seller in the French spirits sector and the best-selling anise-based spirit in the world, selling more than 40 million liters annually. Ricard is a brand of Pernod Ricard, a global spirits and wine company that also owns brands like Absolute, Chivas Regal, Martell, and Pastis 51 (the second best-selling pastis originally produced by Pernod). Last year, Ricard introduced a new identity &#8212; but not a new bottle (yet) &#8212; designed by Paris, France-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yorgo.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Yorgo&amp;Co<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>Redesigning a legendary french brand was a delicate task.

Its half-there, half-not-there slabs were quirky in both good and bad ways, making it unique but also kind of weird. Its holding shape was fine but a little old-fashioned, which made sense since, this is an old-fashioned brand. The new logo attempts to change that and, even though it&#8217;s drawn from the brand&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=ricard+vintage+posters&#038;safe=active&#038;source=lnms&#038;tbm=isch&#038;sa=X&#038;ved=0ahUKEwjE2cXWisncAhWj5IMKHa7CBIUQ_AUICigB&#038;biw=1572&#038;bih=869\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">vintage posters<\/a>, introduces a more contemporary vibe with a bold, extended wordmark.

It&#8217;s too bad that a new bottle wasn&#8217;t part of this launch because that would have made this transformation much more impactful. Overall, to me &#8212; someone that doesn&#8217;t drink the product and isn&#8217;t as familiar with its history or existing identity &#8212; this seems like a great evolution that takes the brand from a traditional-looking old spirit to something more youthful and engaging without going the full Let&#8217;s-Attract-Millennials approach.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Introduced in 1932, Ricard is a pastis &#8212; an anise and licorice-flavored aperitif &#8212; originally conceived by Paul Ricard, a student of fine arts, 23 years old at the time.
