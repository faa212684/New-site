Based in Stockholm, Sweden, the platform has attracted over 75,000 users and provides a &#8220;studio&#8221; to produce, remix, and record music directly on a browser; access to thousands of sounds, loops, effects, and instruments; and a like-minded community to share and collaborate with. At the end of last year, Soundation introduced a new identity designed by Stockholm-based <a href=\"https:\/\/kurppahosk.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kurppa Hosk<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>Kurppa Hosk designed an experience that communicates the brand&#8217;s new ambitions: to facilitate musical creativity around the world. The design overhaul showcases a visual language that is consistent across all channels and touchpoints. Two interconnected rectangles in 45\u00b0 angles signal precision and can be used separately throughout the identity.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/kurppahosk.com\/work\/soundation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kurppa Hosk project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/soundation_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Soundation by Kurppa Hosk\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\" style=\"padding-bottom: 64.25%;\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/soundation_icon_construction.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Icon construction.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The icon in the old logo I&#8217;m guessing was the hole where you put an audio jack &#8212; I&#8217;m also guessing there is a technical term for that hole &#8212; but I&#8217;m not sure what the notch cut-out in the outer ring was meant to be. In any case, it wasn&#8217;t too exciting nor did it feel like cool things would happen if you used Soundation. The new logo has a much more trendy, music scene aesthetic that I think would be more inviting to the type of audience they are looking for. The abstract &#8220;S&#8221; icon is cool and hip and paired with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.swisstypefaces.com\/fonts\/suisse\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Suisse Int&#8217;l<\/a> it takes on a covetable European-ish, cool-kid vibe. If this were for a corporation or consumer product it would be all kinds of gratuitous but for this particular service, it feels appropriate.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/soundation_identity_elements_poster.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Soundation by Kurppa Hosk\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/soundation_identity_elements.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Identity elements poster and video.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/soundation_business_card.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Soundation by Kurppa Hosk\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business card.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/soundation_stationery.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Soundation by Kurppa Hosk\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stationery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/soundation_posters.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Soundation by Kurppa Hosk\" \/>\n<figcaption>Posters.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The identity makes some interesting uses of the 45-degree angles but for the most part &#8212; the very Swiss flush-left-ragged-right type, the bright colors, the dramatic type size changes &#8212; it&#8217;s stuff we&#8217;ve seen many times before in many decades prior. To me, what makes this a little better throughout the applications is the abstract &#8220;S&#8221; icon which stands out nicely in all the layouts and odd things created.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/soundation_website.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Soundation by Kurppa Hosk\" \/>\n<figcaption>Website.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/soundation_dunno_megaphone.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Soundation by Kurppa Hosk\" \/>\n<figcaption>Not sure.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/soundation_dunno_posters.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Soundation by Kurppa Hosk\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/soundation_dunno_stickers.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Soundation by Kurppa Hosk\" \/>\n<figcaption>Also not sure, but things that are flat in a 3D world.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/soundation_records_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Soundation by Kurppa Hosk\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/soundation_records_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Soundation by Kurppa Hosk\" \/>\n<figcaption>Record and&#8230; floppy disks.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/soundation_stickers.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Soundation by Kurppa Hosk\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stickers.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/soundation_shirt.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Soundation by Kurppa Hosk\" \/>\n<figcaption>Shirt.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/soundation_tote.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Soundation by Kurppa Hosk\" \/>\n<figcaption>Tote.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">Overall, this may not be entirely groundbreaking but it feels very appropriate and relevant to the client and their audience and it creates a sense that if you use Soundation cool things will happen&#8230; like megaphones shattering glass posters, so count me in.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 2009, Soundation is a powerful and high-quality online music production service for upcoming and established producers.
