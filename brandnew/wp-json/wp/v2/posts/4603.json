Geisha, Technology, Kawaii, Neon. After an initial trip to Tokyo to find the true essence and mystery of Japan, we analyzed the culture from 3 differing vectors: Value, Art and Experience. As a result, the sum of these conclusions gave us: NATSUKI; the perfect combination between Tradition and Rupture. Minimalism and Superflat, which derive from Medieval Japan, succeeded in its conversion into 21st century Japan.<br \/><br \/>This served as a brand inspired by the neon lights of Tokyo and the phases of the moon. The result is a proposition for symbolistic and contemporary graphics that successfully transports us from the center of Nippon metropolis without moving ourselves from the space designed in collaboration with Philippe Starck.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.erretres.com\/?portfolio=natsuki-tokyo-cuisine-2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Erretres project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<p>This is another of those cases where the scope of the resulting identity trumps the &#8220;smallness&#8221; of the client &#8212; a single restaurant &#8212; to qualify for a Review on Brand New and after you are done scrolling through all the work I think you&#8217;ll agree.

I&#8217;m by no means a Kawaii connoisseur so I don&#8217;t know if any unspoken rules are being broken or the veracity of its application into this identity system but I do know, for a fact, that these geisha balls bring me joy. Lots of it. They are an effusive bunch with great personality and a solid backstory supported by a smart design process. They are also 100% unexpected in the realm of Japanese restaurant identities where most go for either a minimal aesthetic or illustrations of sushi.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/natsuki_07_wordmark_all.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Natsuki by Erretres\" \/>\n<figcaption>Wordmark variations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/natsuki_08_wordmark_grid.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Natsuki by Erretres\" \/>\n<figcaption>Wordmark detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The wordmark has maybe a little too much mumbo jumbo rationale behind it &#8212; you&#8217;ll have to check that at the project page &#8212; where the phases of the moon and the neon lights are supposed to be the reasoning. I would accept &#8220;It&#8217;s made of circles, like the geishas&#8221; as an appropriate answer. It&#8217;s a good complement to the colorful balls and, used mostly in gold, provides a hint of luxury.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/158036589?title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Brand video.

It&#8217;s possible your heart rate goes up just from stepping into it while your retinas age about 10 years ahead of the rest of your body but it&#8217;s fun to see a project take it up to 11, from research to execution. The only reasonable next step in this project is to make plush toy versions of the geishas and I would totally buy one of each.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Opened in 2007, Ramses Life is a gastronomy and event venue in Madrid, Spain, located in the high-traffic roundabout at Puerta de Alcala.
