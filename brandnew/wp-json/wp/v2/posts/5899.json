One of Facebook Free Basics&#8217; top five most visited sites, Springster celebrates the diverse, inspirational and convention defying experiences of girls through entertaining and educational content and stories written for and by girls. Springster helps girls find meaning and strength in each other&#8217;s experiences. In so doing, it creates positive change in girls&#8217; lives by building their knowledge, resilience and self-belief. By tracking real time usage, comments and user engagement, Springster uses a new impact methodology to measure how online behaviour can shape offline action and lead to shifts in girls&#8217; knowledge, attitude and behaviour. Our vision is to enable 100 million girls to find their voice online.&#8221;<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/springster_logo.png\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Springster by DesignStudio\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video controls><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/springster_logo_animation.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo animation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video controls><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/springster_brand_film.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Identity elements.
