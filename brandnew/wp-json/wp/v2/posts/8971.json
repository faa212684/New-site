The new logo is an amazing evolution that takes everything that was bad about the old one and makes it great. The balance of the elements is infinitely better, starting with the removal of the inner stroke, allowing the ball to be bigger, which in turn allows the lion to be more prominent. Including the club&#8217;s motto, &#8220;Ready&#8221; &#8212; which was shortened from &#8220;Aye Ready&#8221; (meaning &#8220;Always Ready&#8221; in Scots) &#8212; inside the ball was also a great move. The lion itself is great evolution, building in a lot of new detail that improves dramatically on the old &#8212; I am not convinced by the shaded version (used outside of the logo) as it adds unnecessary detail and the two marks around its ribs make it look like it hasn&#8217;t eaten in some time. The other highlight of the logo (and identity) is the new custom typeface, which is a lovely flared sans serif that fills up the crest quite nicely. The updated red and blue have that aggressive vibration that can often be off-putting but, as a way to make the logo and brand feel more electrifying, it works. The single-color versions of the logo are pretty hot too.<\/p>\r\n<blockquote>Partnering with internationally renowned typographer and lifelong Rangers&#8217; fan Craig Black, together we explored Ibrox, delving through the archives to craft a custom font, Rangers Display, which perfectly captured Ranger&#8217;s heritage and personality. With serif kicks that echo those of the bluebells at Ibrox&#8217;s iconic gates, the new typeface also takes cues from Ibrox&#8217;s entrance floor mosaic in addition to various letterheads used over the years.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/seesawcreative.co.uk\/work\/rangers-f-c-brand-evolution\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See Saw project page<\/a><\/h3>\r\n<figure class=\"full\">\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/rangers_football_club_type_process.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Rangers Football Club by See Saw Creative\" \/>\r\n<figcaption>Custom typeface process.<\/figcaption>\r\n<\/figure>\r\n<figure class=\"full\">\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/rangers_football_club_type_01.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Rangers Football Club by See Saw Creative\" \/>\r\n<hr \/>\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/rangers_football_club_type_02.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Rangers Football Club by See Saw Creative\" \/>\r\n<hr \/>\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/rangers_football_club_type_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Rangers Football Club by See Saw Creative\" \/>\r\n<figcaption>Custom typeface.<\/figcaption>\r\n<\/figure>\r\n<p>The custom typeface designed in collaboration by <a href=\"https:\/\/craigblackdesign.com\/project\/rangers-football-club\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Craig Black<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/stitzstudio.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Stitzlein Studio<\/a> is lovely and the numerals are great.

The energy is palpable, no question about it, but I feel like maybe it&#8217;s all too much? Gradients, close-ups of the lion, thick lines, thin lines, concentric lines, oddly-floating players&#8217; heads. I mean, I appreciate the boldness and Goes-up-to-11 attitude but, at least for now and as presented, it feels overwhelming and a little inconsistent in its looseness. When the visuals get dialed down, as in the stadium images further below (even in the multi-panel banner), the system is more enjoyable.<\/p>\r\n<figure class=\"full\">\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/rangers_football_club_social_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Rangers Football Club by See Saw Creative\" \/>\r\n<hr \/>\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/rangers_football_club_social_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Rangers Football Club by See Saw Creative\" \/>\r\n<figcaption>Social media.<\/figcaption>\r\n<\/figure>\r\n<figure class=\"full\">\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/rangers_football_stadium_graphics_00.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Rangers Football Club by See Saw Creative\" \/>\r\n<hr \/>\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/rangers_football_stadium_graphics_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Rangers Football Club by See Saw Creative\" \/>\r\n<hr \/>\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/rangers_football_stadium_graphics_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Rangers Football Club by See Saw Creative\" \/>\r\n<hr \/>\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/rangers_football_stadium_graphics_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Rangers Football Club by See Saw Creative\" \/>\r\n<figcaption>Stadium graphics.<\/figcaption>\r\n<\/figure>\r\n<figure class=\"full\">\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/rangers_football_club_tshirts.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Rangers Football Club by See Saw Creative\" \/>\r\n<hr \/>\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/rangers_football_club_merch.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Rangers Football Club by See Saw Creative\" \/>\r\n<figcaption>Merch.<\/figcaption>\r\n<\/figure>\r\n<figure class=\"full\">\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/rangers_football_club_logo_flag.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Rangers Football Club by See Saw Creative\" \/>\r\n<figcaption>Flag.<\/figcaption>\r\n<\/figure>\r\n<p class=\"end\">Overall, this is highly energetic and I think once the dust settles and the application of the visual language becomes more controlled and absorbed in lower doses, this is going to be plenty fun all while supporting the fantastic evolution of the crest as it has been primed for use for another 30 years.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1872, Rangers Football Club is a Scottish professional football club based in Glasgow, Scotland, playing in the Scottish Premiership, the top division of the Scottish Professional Football League.
