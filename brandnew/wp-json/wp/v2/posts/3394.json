More than 1,100 institutions that range from elementary schools to universities to corporations contract Brightspace products to teach a combined 15 million people. With 800 employees in offices around the world, the company operates now as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.d2l.com\/about\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">D2L<\/a> with Brightspace being the consumer product brand name &mdash; its identity has been designed by Brooklyn, NY-based <a href=\"http:\/\/hyperakt.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hyperakt<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>Hyperakt&#8217;s approach was based on a single strategic insight: Brightspace enables a pathway to lifelong learning. This insight informed our creative vision of Brightspace guiding users down their unique paths. We aimed to mirror Brightspace&#8217;s \ufb02exible platform, which adapts to learners&#8217; needs and provides personalized solutions for educators and students.<br \/><br \/>The Brightspace mark needed to resonate as credible and approachable to a large spectrum of learners and educators. It also needed to encompass what learning with Brightspace looks like and feels like. We designed an iconic &#8220;B&#8221; made up of lines that mirror the myriad twists and turns of learning. The mark is paired with a customized logotype, to provide maximum legibility and impact across all sizes and applications.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/hyperakt.com\/items\/brightspace\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hyperakt project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/brightspace_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Brightspace by Hyperakt\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/brightspace_wordmark_explained.gif\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Brightspace by Hyperakt\" \/>\n<figcaption>Starting with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.myfonts.com\/fonts\/g-type\/chevin-pro\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Chevin<\/a>, Hyperakt shows how the wordmark was customized. <\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>I&#8217;m always fascinated by these giant companies with a huge influence that I have never heard of and I&#8217;m always proportionally amused by what terrible logos they use to get there. Set in Verdana bold italic and punctuated by some random molecule, the old logo was pretty terrible and looking at the name all I can think of is <a href=\"www.youtube.com\/watch?v=wiyYozeOoKs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2 legit 2 quit<\/a>. The new logo is a most welcome change that better represents this level of company. The &#8220;B&#8221; monogram is attractive and engaging, forming a &#8220;B&#8221; without being completely prescriptive about it. Somehow it also reminds of an open book. The wordmark goes very well with the monogram and has a lovely rhythm to it.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/brightspace_logo_subbrands.png\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Brightspace by Hyperakt\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sub-brands.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/brightspace_business_card.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Brightspace by Hyperakt\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business card.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The brand extends into a visual language of twisting, transforming paths. Custom iconography helps explain and introduce Brightspace&#8217;s proprietary approach to online learning, while bright fresh colors evoke positive energy and optimism. Bright colors are also positive in learning environments.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/hyperakt.com\/items\/brightspace\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hyperakt project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/brightspace_icons.png\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Brightspace by Hyperakt\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icons.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/brightspace_icons_animation.gif\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Brightspace by Hyperakt\" \/>\n<figcaption>Animated logo surrounded by icons.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/brightspace_brochure.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Brightspace by Hyperakt\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/brightspace_brochure_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Brightspace by Hyperakt\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brochure.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/brightspace_pins.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Brightspace by Hyperakt\" \/>\n<figcaption>Pencils and pins.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">Hyperakt does a great job developing icons for their projects and these not only complement the monogram really well but extend the visual style into other applications and can become the leading visual device in each item. Most of the applications are renderings but show the extent to which the line-y approach can generate a consistent identity without simply repeating the logo over and over. Overall, a very friendly, approachable, yet professional update.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1999 as Desire2Learn, Brightspace is an &quot;integrated learning platform&quot; that offers software and online solutions for teaching students from K-12 through higher education and for training employees at all kinds of professional organizations.
