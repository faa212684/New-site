We have brought it to life in our visual identity through what we call the Smart Layer. The Smart Layer is made up of a grid of particles, these particles are an expression of the network.

That&#8217;s a lot of stuff to see. I assume you&#8217;ve made it this far. I thought it was important to see everything before delving into the opinion as when I first saw this launch I had only seen the little that was available online and it didn&#8217;t quite inspire me. I had even already written a review that was 50\/50 positive\/negative. Seeing everything together makes a big difference. I was initially concerned about all the dots: The logo is made of dots, the custom font is made of dots, the icons are made of dots, the background patterns are made of dots. In that regard the identity becomes repetitive pretty fast. Wolff Olins explains that all these dots are born out of the &#8220;Smart Layer,&#8221; a grid of particles, particles that visualize the 4G network; kind of like The Matrix but with less doom and gloom. So when you watch the brand video at the very top, you can see the particles at work, everywhere and responding to its environment and people and things around it. It&#8217;s a pretty cool effect. From these dots are born the logo, custom type, and icons.<\/p>\n<p>The logo is simple, sure enough, but it&#8217;s also kind of awkward encased in an 8-shape; its symmetry drains it of energy in its static form. Luckily, the Smart Layer and the particles are what give life to the logo and the rest of the identity. I absolutely love how the typography and icons engorge and clog up and react as well as how the logo comes together and makes its centers, both of them, hollow. It&#8217;s hard to convey the movement statically as seen in the EE site (and photographic images directly above) where the icons look like blobs mid-formation and the dot background look like it&#8217;s snowing year-round. The potential is clearly as a great living identity but in its static form it still needs to figure out how to capture the same energy. Nonetheless, this is identity at its most ambitious: building a brand through a visual language and parts that make up the bigger story rather than placing all the weight on a logo&#8217;s shoulders.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_120912_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_120912_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"285\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_120912_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_120912_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"285\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_120912_config_03.xml&#038;xyz=poll_120912_votes_03.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"285\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv3\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv3\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,26,89],"tags":[579,399,228,180],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2120"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2120"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2120\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2120"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2120"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2120"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
