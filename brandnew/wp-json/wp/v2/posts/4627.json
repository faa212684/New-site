The system is available in 1,000 cities (and London), processing nearly 242,000 daily orders and, in 2015, it generated $2.4 billion in gross food sales for the restaurants listed. Grubhub has offices in Chicago, New York, and London, and sub-brands include Seamless, MenuPages, Allmenus, Restaurants on the Run, DiningIn, and Delivered Dish. Earlier this year, Grubhub introduced a new identity designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wolffolins.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wolff Olins<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/grubhub_old.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Grubhub by Wolff Olins\" \/>\n<figcaption>Old look.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>We identified a strategy to help Grubhub create an even better business, including an evolved way of thinking about delivered food and redesign of the brand experience &#8212; to elevate the category overall. We saw an opportunity for Grubhub to take a lead role in the next stage of the food revolution, elevating takeout as a dining choice and connecting with the special moments in everyday life that matter to diners &#8211; from moms feeding ravenous families after school to helping young couples have a spontaneous, and special, evening in.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.wolffolins.com\/work\/56\/grubhub\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wolff Olins project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/grubhub_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Grubhub by Wolff Olins\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/grubhub_logo_animation.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Grubhub by Wolff Olins\" \/>\n<figcaption>Full and shorthand logo variations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/grubhub_app_icon.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Grubhub by Wolff Olins\" \/>\n<figcaption>App icon.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo was really bad with some half-baked wobbly rendering and very nonsensical capitalization as grubHub. The new logo represents the growth and maturity of the company with, perhaps, a more boring logo but, undoubtedly, a more professional one. The new logo maintains the condensed aesthetic of the old one with a very nice, very competent, very well typeset wordmark. No frills. The shorthand &#8220;GH&#8221; comes at an angle that feels like the angles of the curve in the old logo but other than that it feels a little off and odd as nothing else in the identity has that angle again but it&#8217;s a nice monogram lock-up for sure and it works as a distinctive app icon.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/grubhub_app_online.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Grubhub by Wolff Olins\" \/>\n<figcaption>App and desktop.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>To convey Grubhub&#8217;s exciting new food-focused vision, we developed a vibrant and comprehensive new identity system for the brand &#8211;&#8216;the new language of food&#8217;. The visual and verbal identity was designed to evoke a sense of celebration around food and bring a playful personality to eating moments throughout the day. Plus, the system is tailor-made for a mobile first world, where food-related content dominates social feeds.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.wolffolins.com\/work\/56\/grubhub\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wolff Olins project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/grubhub_illustrations_01.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Grubhub by Wolff Olins\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/grubhub_illustrations_02.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Grubhub by Wolff Olins\" \/>\n<figcaption>Illustrations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>While the logo establishes the seriousness of the operation, a range of funky illustrations and lettering add some flavor to the identity.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/grubhub_emojis_2.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Grubhub by Wolff Olins\" \/>\n<figcaption>Emojis, or as they call it, &#8220;mmmojis&#8221;.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/grubhub_texting.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Grubhub by Wolff Olins\" \/>\n<figcaption>Texting within the app.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/grubhub_texting_02.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Grubhub by Wolff Olins\" \/>\n<figcaption>Normal texting.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/grubhub_window_stickers.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Grubhub by Wolff Olins\" \/>\n<figcaption>Window stickers.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/grubhub_ad_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Grubhub by Wolff Olins\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/grubhub_ad_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Grubhub by Wolff Olins\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/grubhub_ad_subway.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Grubhub by Wolff Olins\" \/>\n<figcaption>Advertising.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/grubhub_subway.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Grubhub by Wolff Olins\" \/>\n<figcaption>Subway takeover.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/160924920?title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>TV spot.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">The shaky and wobbly lettering works best when it&#8217;s used on its own against flat colors than when it&#8217;s overlaid on photographs as in the billboard, where the lettering looks almost unfinished and like being from a completely different project. The subway advertising image shows it at its best and makes the brand feel vibrant and bold. Even then, at times, the illustrations feel like they limit the range of restaurants and target audience Grubhub represents: Like, the illustrations seem appropriate for a 20-something eating tacos or burgers on the weekend, not a 40-year-old ordering a nice pasta dinner after a long day at work. Nonetheless, there is a good energy to the identity and advertising and with a solid logo as the foundation, the stuff around it can easily change over the years.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 2004, Grubhub is the leading online and mobile food ordering platform in the U.S., allowing users to order online from over 40,000 takeout restaurants listed.
