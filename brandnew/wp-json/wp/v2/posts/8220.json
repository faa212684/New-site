We have since expanded to 22 cafes in New York and Philadelphia, and a roastery in Long Island City, yet our mission remains unchanged: to serve excellent coffee with warm hospitality in every one of our communities. At Joe, we believe the secret to a great coffee experience relies just as much on the coffee as it does the barista, which is why we foster and promote the continued education and success of our baristas through industry-leading professional training. As an early pioneer of artisan coffee to New York more than 16 years ago, we are proud to continue to innovate, grow, and lead as the specialty coffee movement expands.&#8221;<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/joe_coffee_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Joe Coffee Company by Godfrey Dadich Partners\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/joe_coffee_old_packaging.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Joe Coffee Company by Godfrey Dadich Partners\" \/>\n<figcaption>Samples of OLD packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/joe_coffee_packaging_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Joe Coffee Company by Godfrey Dadich Partners\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/joe_coffee_packaging_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Joe Coffee Company by Godfrey Dadich Partners\" \/>\n<figcaption>Packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/joe_coffee_cups.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Joe Coffee Company by Godfrey Dadich Partners\" \/>\n<figcaption>Cups.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/joe_coffee_tote.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Joe Coffee Company by Godfrey Dadich Partners\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/joe_coffee_merch.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Joe Coffee Company by Godfrey Dadich Partners\" \/>\n<figcaption>Merch.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"(Est. 2003) &quot;Joe Coffee Company was founded in 2003 by Jonathan Rubinstein as a singular specialty coffee house in Manhattan&apos;s West Village with the simple vision of brewing high quality, unique coffees and creating a welcoming space for our community&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,25,85],"tags":[292,772,597,1764,115,53,33],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8220"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=8220"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8220\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=8220"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=8220"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=8220"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
