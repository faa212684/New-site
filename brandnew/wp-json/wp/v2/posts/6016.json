I was approached by DigitasLBi &#8212; CAH&#8217;s agency &#8212; earlier this month to help them spread the prank. I realize Black Friday is not April Fools and that perhaps I shouldn&#8217;t be testing y&#8217;all&#8217;s trust but Black Friday is a horrible tradition and I didn&#8217;t mind playing an itty bitty tiny role in lampooning it. We won&#8217;t make a habit of posting fake things on Black Friday, so no worries. So, yeah, this was a fake but it was as real as it gets, in terms of putting Prongles on shelves&#8230; if you really want a pair of Prongles, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ebay.com\/sch\/i.html?_from=R40&#038;_trksid=p2380057.m570.l1313.TR0.TRC0.H0.Xprongle.TRS0&#038;_nkw=prongles&#038;_sacat=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">there are plenty on eBay.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211;<\/p>\n<p>Launched in 2011, <a href=\"https:\/\/cardsagainsthumanity.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cards Against Humanity<\/a> is a party game &#8212; self-described as being &#8220;for horrible people&#8221; &#8212; where there is a stack of black cards and a stack of white cards. The black cards contain a question or fill-in-the-blank sentence that is read by a different player each round, and the white cards contain answers that the other players submit and compete for being the funniest&#8230; or most offensive. Cards Against Humanity started as a game by eight friends for their own enjoyment but after posting it online to download for free, it caught on, then it moved into a Kickstarter project, and is now sold on Amazon, Target, and online, shipping all over the world. There are now expansion packs, theme packs, and localized packs for the UK, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. Despite the huge success of the game, the company announced today that it will no longer be in the card games business but instead move into the potato chip business because their research &#8220;shows that the snack food industry is bigger and more profitable than the board games industry&#8221;. The identity and packaging for the company&#8217;s new name, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.originalprongles.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Prongles<\/a>, rolling out nationally at Target today, has been designed by Chicago, IL-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.45irving.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">45 Irving<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><p>As some of you might know, Cards Against Humanity is known for pulling Black Friday pranks &#8212; Black Friday, for our international readers, is one of the year&#8217;s most horrible days <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Isyvv7LskTI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">where people trample each other at the crack of dawn<\/a> to save a few hundred dollars on electronics &#8212; like selling <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dailydot.com\/unclick\/cards-against-humanity-bullshit\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sterilized bullshit<\/a> (literally, shit from a bull) or asking their audience to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.slate.com\/blogs\/business_insider\/2015\/11\/30\/cards_against_humanity_black_friday_prank_convinced_tons_of_people_to_donate.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pay $5 for nothing<\/a> (literally, not a thing). I received embargoed PR images for Prongles earlier this week and I wasn&#8217;t going to post it because I assumed it was just this year&#8217;s prank and all the images looked like easy-to-pull-off renders and fake sketches. Even the POP display shown further down in the post seemed like it was a one-off prototype BUT&#8230;<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/prongles_disbelief.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Packaging for Prongles (previously Cards Against Humanity) by 45 Irving\" \/>\n<figcaption>Me and my Prongles purchase.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>This morning, as I trampled with fellow Black Friday-ers &#8212; we needed a new washer for our house &#8212; I decided to go see if it was for real and, sure enough, Prongles were being sold at the Target in Bloomington, IN, so it wasn&#8217;t like Cards Against Humanity just plopped them in their local Targets in Chicago but these are actually getting nationwide distribution. Prongles is real. The CAH site is not selling cards anymore and Target has even pulled off any remaining inventory from their shelves. So, here are those embargoed images that I guess had a good reason for being embargoed.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/prongles_sketches_02.png\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Packaging for Prongles (previously Cards Against Humanity) by 45 Irving\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sketches.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/prongles_logo.png\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Packaging for Prongles (previously Cards Against Humanity) by 45 Irving\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/prongles_logo_grid.png\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Packaging for Prongles (previously Cards Against Humanity) by 45 Irving\" \/>\n<figcaption>Underlying grid.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/prongles_logo_colors.png\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Packaging for Prongles (previously Cards Against Humanity) by 45 Irving\" \/>\n<figcaption>Color variations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Instead of coming up with a fully original product name, Cards Against Humanity keeps pushing the envelope &#8212; I actually really respect that they are sticking with their stick-it-to-the-establishment schtick &#8212; by adopting a name and logo that is probably 24 hours away from a cease and desist letter from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pringles.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pringles<\/a>. This approach will surely yield more sales because of the novelty and satirical bent. The new logo is a cheap rip of the <a href=\"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/thumb\/7\/71\/Pringles.svg\/1200px-Pringles.svg.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pringles logo<\/a>, inferior in every way possible, its only saving grace being the idea of the &#8220;e&#8221; eating the &#8220;s&#8221; but that &#8220;s&#8221; looks like an intestine so the execution cancels out the concept. They also managed to find a crappier font than Comic Sans for &#8220;Original&#8221;, which is not even spaced properly in that counterspace between the &#8220;P&#8221; and the &#8220;l&#8221;. The color variations on the logo are almost laughable, since they all get muddied up with the black stroke. But, I guess, as a logo to potentially confuse people into buying Prongles instead of Pringles, it&#8217;s not bad.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/prongles_cans.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Packaging for Prongles (previously Cards Against Humanity) by 45 Irving\" \/>\n<figcaption>Packaging, all flavors.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/prongles_cans_detail_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Packaging for Prongles (previously Cards Against Humanity) by 45 Irving\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/prongles_cans_detail_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Packaging for Prongles (previously Cards Against Humanity) by 45 Irving\" \/>\n<figcaption>Packaging, detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The packaging, sold in <a href=\"https:\/\/images.kglobalservices.com\/www.pringles.com_it\/it_it\/product\/product_3311829\/prod_img-3311847_pringles_original_190g_en.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the same kind of tube as Pringles<\/a>, does look quite different from it, featuring a hog mascot, named Brayden, along with the standard-issue bursts and patterns of mainstream packaging.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/prongles_character_detail_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Packaging for Prongles (previously Cards Against Humanity) by 45 Irving\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/prongles_character_detail_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Packaging for Prongles (previously Cards Against Humanity) by 45 Irving\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brayden, the Prongles hog.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>That&#8217;s Brayden, the Prongles hog!
