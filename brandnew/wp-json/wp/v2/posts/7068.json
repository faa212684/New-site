The idea of using paper-cut children was perhaps good but the execution of them on a cube ruined the concept and resulted in a very awkward icon. The new icon is a charming, colorful abstraction of a child figure that uses the easily recognizable traits of a band-aid &#8212; or adhesive bandage, since Band-Aid is a trademark name &#8212; to create an instant connection between healing and kids.<\/p>\n<p>The execution is excellent, using a simple pattern change at the intersection of the two shapes to create the soft-padded-y part of the band-aid. The proportions of the icon are spot on, with the head just slightly bigger than the thickness of the &times; and nicely nestled between it. You would expect these things to be the case but it would be pretty easy to get them wrong. The pattern variations of the icon are great and pairing the icon with a heart graphic as part of the identity makes for an endearing, easy to understand message without using any words. The wordmark, in GT Walsheim, is fine but the all-lowercase approach in a name that&#8217;s almost a complete sentence on its own, especially one that contains a proper noun (Montr\u00e9al), is not entirely convincing.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/montreal_childrens_hospital_foundation_business_guidelines_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Montreal Children&amp;apos;s Hospital Foundation by Cossette\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/montreal_childrens_hospital_foundation_business_guidelines_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Montreal Children&amp;apos;s Hospital Foundation by Cossette\" \/>\n<figcaption>Guidelines.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/montreal_childrens_hospital_foundation_stationery.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Montreal Children&amp;apos;s Hospital Foundation by Cossette\" \/>\n<figcaption>Letterhead.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/montreal_childrens_hospital_foundation_business_cards.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Montreal Children&amp;apos;s Hospital Foundation by Cossette\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/montreal_childrens_hospital_foundation_business_guidelines_stuff_guerir_heal.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Montreal Children&amp;apos;s Hospital Foundation by Cossette\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/montreal_childrens_hospital_foundation_business_guidelines_stuff_aimer_love.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Montreal Children&amp;apos;s Hospital Foundation by Cossette\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/montreal_childrens_hospital_foundation_business_guidelines_stuff_sunir_bond.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Montreal Children&amp;apos;s Hospital Foundation by Cossette\" \/>\n<figcaption>Various materials.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Rh4j48QU0SA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Manifesto-y video.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>[On October 31, students from Montr\u00e9al primary school \u00c9cole Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy collected donations to organize a blowout Halloween party for kids at the Hospital. &#8220;When you see five to eight-year-olds willing to trade their princess or Harry Potter costume for a hospital gown to help other children, it makes us adults want to chip in too,&#8221; said Vicky Morin, creative director at Cossette.<br \/><br \/>Thanks to the generosity of the students and the people who donated to the cause, the children at the Hospital enjoyed a magical event that included shadow puppets, an oversized pi\u00f1ata and giant interactive costume, a message from Foundation spokesperson and hockey player PK Subban, and a wheelchair race.<\/blockquote><h3>Cossette provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/tCux8fA8bmQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Halloween feel-good video.
