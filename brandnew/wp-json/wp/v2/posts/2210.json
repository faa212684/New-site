Earlier this month, Galavisi&oacute;n introduced a new logo designed by New York, NY-based <a href=\"http:\/\/pmcddesign.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PMcD Design<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>[The] new look reflects the fun, fresh and modern attitude of today&#8217;s Hispanic American audiences. The new brand identity maintains the familiar &#8220;G&#8221; mark and orange color palette, but now with a clean, contemporary and unique design that is dynamic, fluid, and all embracing.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/corporate.univision.com\/2012\/hispanic-consumer\/marketing-insights\/galavision-presents-new-brand-image\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press Release<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/galavision_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"Galavisi&oacute;n Logo\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">On the detail views above and below, the monogram changes into a 3D version.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/galavision_logo_vertical.gif\" alt=\"Galavisi&oacute;n Logo\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The old logo was absolutely hideous. There really isn&#8217;t any other way to put it. The awful &#8220;G&#8221; that spears some kind of olive-like shape and the tittle-less wordmark, all drenched in a drab orange and blue color palette didn&#8217;t quite make for much of a memorable mark. The new logo is better. But only because of the aforementioned qualities of its predecessor. The new monogram is an abstract interpretation of a &#8220;G&#8221; that comes in two varieties: flat and 3D, just like its parent company &mdash; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/logo_gigante.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">see review here<\/a>. Except&hellip; here the perspectives don&#8217;t match. On the flat logo we see the &#8220;G&#8221; from the front and on the 3D we see it rotated slightly on two different axis, giving you completely different views. Both, however, are equally poor. The 3D view in its graphic &#8220;explicitness&#8221; leaves nothing to the imagination and all it is is an extruded shape with a minor bevel. The flat view, which could be sort of interesting in that the right-side shape could be perceived as the inner funnel of the &#8220;G&#8221; is not supported in the 3D view, so it really doesn&#8217;t make sense at all.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/galavision_type_comparison.gif\" alt=\"Galavisi&oacute;n Logo\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Then there is the typography. It tries to follow Univision&#8217;s lead with a geometric sans serif but instead of doing it right and even borrowing the damn &#8220;vision&#8221; characters Galavisi&oacute;n shares with it, they do something that sort of looks like it but it&#8217;s actually just a much poorer rendition of it. Just compare the &#8220;s&#8221;s. Awful. Underneath the wordmark is a descriptor, available in both English and Spanish flavors, set in Helvetica, which has nothing to do with the type above it. Lastly, the descriptor is set in a shade of gray just about 10% or 15% lighter. Why?Either make them the same or obviously different. Overall, this is only better by comparison but in the end it&#8217;s just a random &#8220;G&#8221; monogram with second-rate typography.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.emblemetric.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">James I.
