Like its sister channel, MTV, VH1 has mutated into a reality TV channel &mdash; i.e., <em>Mob Wives<\/em>, <em>Basketball Wives<\/em>, <em>Hollywood Exes<\/em>, <em>Mama Drama<\/em>, <em>Rehab with Dr. Drew<\/em>, etc. &mdash; where sometimes you might catch a music video or two. Over the weekend, and to start off the new year with a large rebrand, VH1 introduced a new logo and on-air look that signify what the channel has, reportedly, always been: &#8220;The Ultimate Mash Up&#8221;. No <strike>design credit given or<\/strike> press release issued but you can follow the launch with the <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/search?q=%23plussed&#038;src=hash\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">#plussed<\/a> hash tag. The logo and on-air package have been designed by New York, NY-based <a href=\"http:\/\/gretel.tv\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gretel<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/vh1_2013_logo_history.gif\" alt=\"VH1 Logo and On-Air\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">VH1&#8217;s logo over the years.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/vh1_2013_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"VH1 Logo and On-Air\" \/><\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"574\" height=\"323\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/WXDlS9SuONU\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">New logo introduction.<\/p>\n<p>All I can say is good effin&#8217; riddance. The old logo is one of my most despised of all time and although in execution on-air it was more or less salvaged by clever animation, the underlying structure was always bunk. The new logo is&hellip; interesting. I like that it references the very first logo in its history both visually and by re-introducing the hyphen as a plus. When I first saw the logo I immediately got it that the &#8220;H&#8221; formed a plus but it poses a slight readability problem in that it reads as &#8220;VI + 1&#8221;. The logo and new on-air typography have that unpolished look that seems to be a new trend with letterforms that have harsh cuts and small rounded corners that just take the edge off the sans serif without going into rounded sans serif territory. The on-air looks promising and full of potential but I wonder how long the &#8220;flat&#8221; look will last and\/or how many takes on plus signs the audience can endure. Overall, I can&#8217;t help but be pleased by the change and this cements VH1 as the Pepsi to MTV&#8217;s Coca-Cola where the former has gone through six logo changes while the latter remains relatively unchanged.<\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"574\" height=\"323\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/X_tV4RTms1w\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Promo for new reality shows using the new logo and look.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/vh1_2013_promo.jpg\" alt=\"VH1 Logo and On-Air\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Behind-the-scenes on the promo.
