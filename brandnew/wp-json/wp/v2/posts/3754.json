Most of the BBC&#8217;s national television and radio news output came from here. On 16 July 2012, the BBC agreed to sell the site to Stanhope plc for \u00a3200 million. The building closed on 31 March 2013 and will be redeveloped to include flats, office space, a cinema and hotels. Studios 1, 2 and 3 along with part of the basement and offices will be refurbished and leased back to the BBC on a 15 year lease.<br \/><br \/>Developers Stanhope said in April 2014 that the new <a href=\"http:\/\/televisioncentre.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Television Centre<\/a> development would &#8220;pay homage to the original use of the building&#8221; and retain original features of the buildings including the &#8216;doughnut&#8217;, atomic dot wall and Helios statue. The new Television Centre will be opened up to the public and will offer entertainment and leisure facilities, including a new branch of members&#8217; club Soho House, offices aimed at the creative sector and approximately 1,000 new homes, together with pedestrian access through the site providing connectivity with the local area, including Hammersmith Park.
