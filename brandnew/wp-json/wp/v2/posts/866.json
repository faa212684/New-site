For offset and other specialty quality printers, companies like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.vistaprint.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Vistaprint<\/a> hold a similar position: cheap, fast, mediocre quality. If you have ever printed anything with a quality printer and anything with Vistaprint you know the difference but, let&#8217;s face it, most civilians (non-designers) people don&#8217;t &mdash; which is worth more than $400 million in 2008 revenue for Vistaprint, according to their 10-k. And <a href=\"http:\/\/www.graphicartsonline.com\/info\/CA6468782.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Graphic Arts Online<\/a>, lists it as the 40th top printer in North America.<\/p><!--more--><p>But we are here to talk about their logo, which very much appropriately looks as if it was designed by LogoWorks or one of its ilk. For a public company with such high stakes you would think they might opt for something a little more sophisticated than fountains of CMY(no K) gushing out of their name. The previous logo didn&#8217;t set a very high standard but at the very least it didn&#8217;t call too much attention to itself, with the thin lines and small type. This one demands that you see it, and it&#8217;s not a pretty sight. The typography looks like the bastard child of Tobias Frere-Jones&#8217; Interstate and Avenir, and those have to be the smallest, relatively speaking, tittles (dots over the &#8220;i&#8221;s) I have seen lately. What&#8217;s even sadder is that you could flip the logos and have the old one replace the new one and it wouldn&#8217;t make a difference, they are both equally underwhelming. <\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/coroflot.com\/mindiola\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">John Mindiola III<\/a> for the tip.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,71,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/866"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=866"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/866\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=866"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=866"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=866"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
