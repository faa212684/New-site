Recently, Contact Energy introduced a new identity designed by the Wellington, NZ, office of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.designworks.co.nz\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Designworks<\/a> who worked with San Francisco, CA-based <a href=\"http:\/\/jessicahische.is\/energized\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jessica Hische<\/a> to develop the wordmark.<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/contact_sketches.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Contact Energy by Designworks\" \/>\n<figcaption>Wordmark process by Jessica Hische.

I&#8217;m sure there were a dozen positive meanings for what the swooshes meant but, in terms of logos with apparent meaning, it had none. The italic typography was sort of interesting. The old logo simply looked like other energy company logos are meant to look (except this one wasn&#8217;t blue). The new logo is a fine piece of lettering, I love me a good brush script as much as the next craft beer maker but it feels too far-fetched to use it for an energy company. It&#8217;s obvious (and highly commendable) that Contact wants to look friendlier and more approachable than other energy companies and is looking to visually differentiate itself but this wordmark makes the company look small, like a boutique energy company where you pay for your energy on an iPad using a Square and take it home in a mason jar with a letterpress label on it and a candy-cane-colored ribbon tied around it. If I were buying marshmallows I would love this and think it&#8217;s perfect.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/contact_stationery.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Contact Energy by Designworks\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stationery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/contact_signage_patterns.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Contact Energy by Designworks\" \/>\n<figcaption>Signage prototype and patterns.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/contact_brochure.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Contact Energy by Designworks\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brochure.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/contact_annual_report.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Contact Energy by Designworks\" \/>\n<figcaption>2013 annual report.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/contact_livery.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Contact Energy by Designworks\" \/>\n<figcaption>Livery prototype.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/contact_tshirt_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Contact Energy by Designworks\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/contact_tshirt_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Contact Energy by Designworks\" \/>\n<figcaption>T-shirt prototypes.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">In application, the identity continues to strive for a more festive and lighthearted style. Again, the execution looks great and fun but it&#8217;s hard to marry the two opposites. The brochure and annual report start to become the proper blend of serious and fun with a nice color palette and interesting use of bold serif. Perhaps I&#8217;m just jaded when it comes to big companies gunning for a family-style identity and this is indeed a solid direction to go in. It&#8217;s a valiant effort but if you are a big, serious energy company I don&#8217;t think there is any reason to shy away from that and build an accessible identity that still establishes a certain kind of dominance and distance between company and customer.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1996, Contact Energy is one of the leading energy generators and retailers in New Zealand, providing electricity, natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas to around 566,000 customers with the help of over 1,100 employees.
