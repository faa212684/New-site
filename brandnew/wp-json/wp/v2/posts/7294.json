The identity, designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/rice-creative.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rice Creative<\/a>, brings to life Publik Office&#8217;s mission to &#8220;Boldly Occupy Space&#8221; by transforming the logo&#8217;s underline into spacious rectangles that, well, boldly occupy spaces. It&#8217;s a very straightforward identity but the very few elements in play are very well balanced and presented to create a distinct look. I&#8217;m not a fan of Helvetica and much less its condensed counterpart but I can acknowledge the limitations of my own blanket dismissal of anything Helvetica because this logo, in Helvetica Neue Condensed, looks quite good. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/71530453\/Publik-Office\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Easy Peasy by CFC<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_easypeasy.jpg\" alt=\"Easy Peasy by CFC\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">Easy Peasy is a new cosmetic brand recently launched by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.apgroup.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amore Pacific<\/a>, a well-known Korean skincare product company. (I couldn&#8217;t find a direct link to the product line but it looks legit.) The identity, designed by Seoul, Korea-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.contentformcontext.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CFC<\/a>, has a fun 1980s vibe with the thick squiggly line running across packaging and the color palette of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?safe=active&#038;biw=1360&#038;bih=843&#038;tbm=isch&#038;sa=1&#038;ei=ZixUXN6CJ8_8jwSsl6IY&#038;q=patrick+nagel&#038;oq=patrick+nagel&#038;gs_l=img.3..0l2j0i67j0l7.18571.21898..22213...2.0..0.112.976.14j1......1....1..gws-wiz-img.nO8Hbnvtm9c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Patrick Nagel paintings<\/a> but, at the same time, it is not so heavily 80s as to be its only merit. The condensed typography is playful and bouncy while the heart-face icon thing in the corner adds another spark. This looks geared towards a younger audience and, in that regard, it works perfectly. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/71716287\/EASY-PEASY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Hexarem by BANGBANG<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_hexarem.jpg\" alt=\"Hexarem by BANGBANG\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hexarem.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hexarem<\/a> in Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec, provides executive compensation advisory services to companies. Meaning, I think, that they figure out how much of a lot of money to pay to officers and executives. Ergo, it&#8217;s fancy. The identity, designed by local firm <a href=\"https:\/\/bangbang.ca\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BANGBANG<\/a>, features an icon made from combining various &#8220;H&#8221;s into a hexagon shape that yields a very elegant and intriguing graphic element. Paired with the somewhat off-kilter serif, it creates a corporate but not <em>too<\/em> corporate vibe while the color palette of pink, gray, and green creates a sophisticated vibe with a bit of opulence through the use of copper ink. I&#8217;m not a big fan of the &#8220;H&#8221; pattern but I don&#8217;t mind it too much. What I want to know, though, is where does one procure giant copper paper clips? <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/bangbang.ca\/blogs\/projets\/hexarem\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"A relatively wacky project splits two more buttoned-up projects this week, with work from Ho Chi Minh City, Seoul, and Montr\u00e9al&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[51,36,11,26],"tags":[1374,1511,1107,1525,886],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7294"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=7294"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7294\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=7294"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=7294"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=7294"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
