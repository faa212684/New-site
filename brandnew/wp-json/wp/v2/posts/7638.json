It currently operates two hotels, one in London and one in Amsterdam, and will be opening two more, one in Brussels and one in Manchester. With a green and sustainable mindset, Qbic has developed its own custom room furniture that integrates a giant bed frame (including a bed and nooks and crannies for stuff) with a bathroom and all the necessary electrical wirings, allowing them to install a room in pretty much any space. An eye for quirky furniture and decor, makes these hotels a lot more attractive than your average budget hotel and a lot more memorable than your average large chain hotel. Recently, Qbic introduced a new identity designed by London, UK-based <a href=\"https:\/\/raggededge.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ragged Edge<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>Ragged Edge helped create a strategic platform that could inform every part of the Qbic experience, internally and externally. &#8220;We wanted to take Qbic&#8217;s desire to\u00a0do good, and amplify it into something bigger and more emotional&#8221; says Max Ottignon, Co-founder, Ragged Edge. &#8220;This led us to &#8216;Welcome Character&#8217;, a brand idea that&#8217;s as distinct in the category as it is relevant to guests who want to be treated as individuals, not room numbers.&#8221;<\/blockquote><h3>Ragged Edge provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/qbic_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Qbic by Ragged Edge\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo looked fully like it belonged to any of the generic budget hotels that are a dime a dozen in Europe and provided no indication that this one was any different. Visually it was more or less (less, actually) fine and inoffensive. The new logo, with its relatively flamboyant &#8220;Q&#8221; is far more unique, interesting, and reflective of the personality of the hotels. I really like the big, bold, curly tail of the &#8220;Q&#8221;, especially how it fills the counter space of the round letter to balance out the negative space (otherwise it would look like a giant hole) and the rounded-corners of A2-TYPE&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.a2-type.co.uk\/boing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Boing<\/a> work well to soften the logo.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/qbic_logo_with_patterns.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Qbic by Ragged Edge\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo with patterns.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The new visual identity is inspired by the hotel&#8217;s\u00a0physical layout, and the coming together of\u00a0different people and ideas.

And perhaps that&#8217;s not a terrible thing; being a small hotel that runs through applications quickly &#8212; thinking of those key cards in particular &#8212; it would be eas(ier) to introduce a new identity around the new logo. The color palette is nice and deserves a mention for not being the typical purple-red-blue color palette of the late-2010s.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/qbic_signage.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Qbic by Ragged Edge\" \/>\n<figcaption>Signage.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/qbic_checkin_area.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Qbic by Ragged Edge\" \/>\n<figcaption>Check-in area.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/qbic_spin_sign.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Qbic by Ragged Edge\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sign.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>While Qbic&#8217;s rooms are for overnight guests, the shared space is for everyone.

The thin typewriter font for the logo is hipstery and fun while the blob patterns take on more figurative expressions and the funky rotating physical sign from the check-in area makes another appearance. The exterior signage with the thin stroke of the logo translated into a physical thing looks great.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/qbic_motley_signage.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Qbic by Ragged Edge\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/qbic_motley_signage_exterior.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Qbic by Ragged Edge\" \/>\n<figcaption>Interior and exterior signage.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">Overall, this is a good-looking update that is a better representation of the hotel experience and\nmakes for a nice system that conveys that Qbic hotels are a place where you can get a good night&#8217;s sleep and some decent avo toast.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 2009, Qbic is a small chain of low-cost, boutique, urban hotels.
