Its signature beer, a pilsner (or pislen in Portuguese), is the fourth most popular beer behind powerhouse brands from AmBev (Skol, Brahma, Antarctica).

The logo with the flared serifs was a decent piece of lettering but suffered from poor stroking and I wouldn&#8217;t be doing my job if I didn&#8217;t point out the Amazon River-wide kerning gap between the &#8220;AV&#8221; pair. The new logo maintains the flared serif approach but goes with a more condensed structure and tilts the typography upwards, giving it a quick burst of energy. Given how difficult these set of letters are to kern, at an angle no less &#8212; you try it hotshot &#8212; this is very well resolved and a very convincing wordmark with great rhythm. The new logo implements a slightly oversized crown drawing that becomes a key device throughout the packaging. It&#8217;s a nice, simple depiction of a crown and I like how the thick line interacts with the thin line by interlocking and generating two sharp shadows (that look best on dark backgrounds).<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/itaipava_can_before_after.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Itaipava by Futurebrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Can, before and after.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/itaipava_bottle_before_after.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Itaipava by Futurebrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Bottle, before and after.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/itaipava_cans.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Itaipava by Futurebrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>New cans.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/itaipava_cans_hero_shot.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Itaipava by Futurebrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Can hero shot.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/itaipava_cans_ice_2.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Itaipava by Futurebrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Can sweaty shot.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/itaipava_bottles.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Itaipava by Futurebrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Bottles.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/itaipava_bottles_hero_shot.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Itaipava by Futurebrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Bottle hero shot.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/itaipava_range.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Itaipava by Futurebrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>From can to pint.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old cans and bottles weren&#8217;t terrible in their overall impression but once you got into the details it didn&#8217;t quite hold up. Every illustration element &#8212; hops, crown, mountains, other crown &#8212; was in a different style and the only thing holding them together was, literally, a holding shape that, itself, had a different style. Yet somehow, as a whole (and when seen from afar or as a small JPG), it worked. The new packaging does a fresh restart instead of trying to maintain shelf consistency and is all the better for it.<\/p>\n<p>The angle of the logo drives the layout of the packaging with a strong diagonal giving the cans and bottle labels a bold, gold top; a large logo, and then plenty of luxurious white space. On the cans and labels, the combination of the crown, the diagonal, and the fully white space where there is no line pattern it looks like an implied sword (or a Latin cross) both of which are not bad subconscious images to see in a beer. Maybe it&#8217;s the very effective product shots but I really like the overall vibe of the new look.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/itaipava_stuff_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Itaipava by Futurebrand\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/itaipava_stuff_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Itaipava by Futurebrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Additional applications.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">The renders of additional products and accompanying objects are entertaining &#8212; that fridge! with the angled ventilation at the bottom! &#8212; but start to feel a little repetitive, which is not a terrible thing as it&#8217;s all about consistency but it&#8217;s almost like Russian nesting dolls with the same thing inside the same thing. Overall, a major improvement that brings both energy and finesse to the packaging and the larger presence of the brand.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"First brewed in 1994, Itaipava is a line of beers available in Brazil produced by Grupo Petr\u00f3polis.
