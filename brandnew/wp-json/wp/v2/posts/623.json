Earlier this month, Intuit unveiled (internally) a new logo that replaces the android with a more broadly humanized representation of, well, humans.<\/p><!--more--><p>There isn&#8217;t much information yet on the rebranding, as the web site still has the old logo and no press release has been released. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thetechgap.com\/2008\/04\/a-new-look-for.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TechGap.com does have some information on the matter<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote>&#8220;The brand will be rolled out gradually on the Web and in conjunction with product launches beginning in the fall,&#8221; according to Rich Walker, Intuit media relations. &#8220;This refreshed brand will place new and broader emphasis on the Intuit name. It will serve as our corporate brand and as the master brand for our small and mid-sized business products.&#8221;<\/blockquote>\n<p>The site also mentions that New York-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lippincott.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lippincott<\/a> designed the new identity, which is a vast improvement from the previous one which feels dated to a time when people had just discovered computers. The new logo does verge on the cliche, with the &#8220;t&#8221;s taking the shape of stick figures, but somehow manages to make it work semi-convincingly. I am not a fan at all of the upper and lower case combination, but the letterforms are at least unified in weight, making the shifts less jarring.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/intuit_sign.jpg\" alt=\"Intuit Sign\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>What looks like a cell phone picture of what could be the internal unveiling of the logo. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/mtnbkr1\/2382692289\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Photo from mtnbkr1&#8217;s Flickr account<\/a>.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The image above shows a nice detail when the logo exists as an object, with the dots being produced as spheres, instead of just extruding them as tubes. Until I wrote this post I had no idea that Intuit was also the maker of QuickBooks, the current administrative tool of UnderConsideration LLC, which points to both the fact that I don&#8217;t pay enough attention to this aspect of running a business (luckily, my wife and partner does!) and that Intuit as a brand is generally overshadowed by its products that probably enjoy more market recognition than their parent company. This new identity feels more poised to be a visual cue in branding the company&#8217;s popular products.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/designblotter.tumblr.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Michael<\/a> and Simone for the tip.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,26,88],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/623"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=623"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/623\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=623"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=623"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=623"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
