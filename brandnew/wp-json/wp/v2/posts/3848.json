By <a href=\"http:\/\/www.catk.de\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CATK<\/a>.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The previous logo wasn&#8217;t too terrible but it definitely did not convey a friendly presence representing a company focusing on alternative, earth-conscious source of energy. With its sharp and blunt monogram and red and black color palette it was a pretty bad match. The new logo solves all those shortcomings and then some. The new KK monogram is built from four identical triangles that hint to the shape of a windmill blade without being an exact replica. The soft corners make for a very pleasant contour that avoids the harshness of most &#8220;K&#8221;s. I really like the lock-up with the name, placing &#8220;Wind Solutions&#8221; almost like an exponent (or power-to-the-n) <em>and<\/em> that both designer and client resisted the need to spell out the &#8220;KK&#8221; again, trusting that people will be able to read the monogram and name as a whole.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kk_wind_solutions_01_business_cards.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for KK Wind Solutions by Heydays\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kk_wind_solutions_03_letterhead.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for KK Wind Solutions by Heydays\" \/>\n<figcaption>Letterhead.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kk_wind_solutions_03_guidelines_cover.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for KK Wind Solutions by Heydays\" \/>\n<figcaption>Guidelines cover.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kk_wind_solutions_04_guidelines_pattern.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for KK Wind Solutions by Heydays\" \/>\n<figcaption>Guidelines sample page explaining the pattern.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>At the core of the identity is the basic triangle shape that makes up the monogram, which is used in multiple ways, from a dense and regulated pattern that mimics wind patterns to a more randomly placed pattern to large full-bleed uses. Surprisingly they all work equally good and never feel disparate or inconsistent.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kk_wind_solutions_05_journal.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for KK Wind Solutions by Heydays\" \/>\n<figcaption>Notebook.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kk_wind_solutions_06_tape.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for KK Wind Solutions by Heydays\" \/>\n<figcaption>Tape.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kk_wind_solutions_07_sign.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for KK Wind Solutions by Heydays\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sign.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kk_wind_solutions_08_door.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for KK Wind Solutions by Heydays\" \/>\n<figcaption>Frosted.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kk_wind_solutions_09_hardhat.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for KK Wind Solutions by Heydays\" \/>\n<figcaption>Hard hat.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kk_wind_solutions_10_confetti.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for KK Wind Solutions by Heydays\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo confetti!<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">Overall, this is a great non-literal logo and lively identity that nail the corporate gravitas without sacrificing personality.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1981 and headquartered in Ikast, Denmark, KK Wind Solutions specializes in electrical systems for wind turbines providing development of state-of-the-art systems and lean manufacturing as well as overseeing their distribution, installation, and maintenance.
