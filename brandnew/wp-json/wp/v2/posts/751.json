The graphic concept had potential but it suffered a rather lackluster execution, especially in the integration of the typography. And while the intent of the new logo to symbolize <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Marianne\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Marianne<\/a> in an energetic illustration in the french color palette (and at least that of <a href=\"http:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/Sovereign- state_flags\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">29 other sovereign-states<\/a>) is moderately interesting, it suffers from a similar deficiency in execution. The line work is neither loose enough to retain energy nor standardized enough to coalesce the diverse elements. One of those elements is the typographic treatment, which while appropriately informal and playful in the tag-line &#8220;Rendez vous en france&#8221;, is overworked and over-manipulated in &#8220;france&#8221;. A previous version of the new logo (shown below), released in June of 2008, had more breast definition and was deemed too risqu&eacute; &mdash; though maybe being excessively something would have been better than excessively nothing.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/france_logo_previous.gif\" alt=\"Previous iteration\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Previous version of the new logo&hellip; NSFW?
