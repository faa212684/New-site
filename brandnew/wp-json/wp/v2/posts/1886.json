YLE runs four television channels, six radio stations, and has a strong online presence. Last year it announced it would be adopting a new logo and this past week the changes took effect in the on-air graphics. The identity was designed in-house with lettering of the logo provided by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.typogra.fi\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Saku Hein&auml;nen<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>YLE&#8217;s branding will receive a turquoise tinge, an amalgamation of the company&#8217;s two current colours: blue and green. At the same time, the new colour is brighter and fresher.<br \/><br \/>The new look is intended to reflect YLE&#8217;s values of Finnishness, dependability, versatility and independence. Most of the work on the redesign was done by YLE&#8217;s own graphics department.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/yle.fi\/uutiset\/news\/2011\/12\/yle_to_get_new_look_3117107.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">News item<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/yle_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"YLE\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/yle_logos_all.gif\" alt=\"YLE\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve scrolled this far you can see exactly what the problem was with the previous 14 logos and their respective identities: it was a big, confused mess where each entity went whichever way it wanted and, amazingly, they all went to where they got beaten with the ugly stick. If you&#8217;ve scrolled this far you can also see what the problem is with the new 14 logos: they are all now consistently boring and devoid of any personality of their own. I am all for consistency and unification of identities but this is far too clinical. Judging from the brief look at the on-air package available <a href=\"http:\/\/areena.yle.fi\/video\/1330887434960\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a> there isn&#8217;t much visual distinction made there either. In defense of the new main logo, though, it&#8217;s a nice piece of typography with interesting shapes and counterspaces but the life is sucked out of it trapped in that square. I may obviously be missing some cultural references or context and perhaps this is the way the Finnish like their public broadcast to look, but it just seems like a missed opportunity after all the effort it will take to phase out all the old stuff for the new.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to Timo Toivonen for first tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_120316_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_120316_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"574\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,66,26],"tags":[108,419,42,189],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1886"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1886"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1886\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1886"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1886"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1886"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
