In 2015, it was granted Taught Degree Awarding Powers by the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education and earlier this year it was awarded University status by the Privy Council; the only applicant to receive the status this year. Now known as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ucs.ac.uk\/home.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">University of Suffolk<\/a>, it is the only tertiary education institution in Suffolk, UK, and counts with nearly 5,000 students across five sites in Suffolk county. The new identity has been designed by Leeds, UK-based <a href=\"http:\/\/onlystudio.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Only Studio<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>Following extensive consultation with stakeholders, our priority became crafting a bold, contemporary and flexible system to accommodate the many faces of the University. A forward facing angle is used throughout the identity to reflect progressive change, and to create reference to the University&#8217;s location in the South East of England within the logo itself. The device is paired with a modern palette and confident typographic applications.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/onlystudio.co.uk\/university-suffolk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Only Studio project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/university_of_suffolk_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for University of Suffolk by Only Studio\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo was cheesy, looking more like a place to learn HTML1 than a university or, as it were, a funnel for two universities. There wasn&#8217;t anything offensive about it and it was relatively properly done but it came across as a cheap alternative to education. The new logo is remarkably confident in its minimalism. A square with a triangle highlighted by a cut? That&#8217;s bold. Especially for a new university with a new name. Even without being overly familiar with the geography of the UK the moment I saw the logo I thought it was pointing to its relative location. It&#8217;s not a logo that makes me smile or jump for joy in any way; it&#8217;s as dry as a textbook cover but I really like the simplicity and proper balance it has with the wordmark, which has the perfect length of characters to break into a nice, pleasantly ragged two lines of text typeset in Commercial Type&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/commercialtype.com\/catalog\/graphik\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Graphik<\/a>.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/university_of_suffolk_posters_01.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for University of Suffolk by Only Studio\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/university_of_suffolk_posters_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for University of Suffolk by Only Studio\" \/>\n<figcaption>Various posters.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>As you would expect, the angle of the logo is a recurring element in the identity but it&#8217;s used in a fairly subtle way that doesn&#8217;t become grating in long doses. The angle is offset by bold typography, sometimes angled vertically. Again, nothing earth-shattering, just well done, well balanced, and nicely color-coordinated in black, yellow, white, and shades of gray. The one thing that bothers me is that the headline typography is set in a similar sans serif that&#8217;s different but not quite different from the logo, <a href=\"https:\/\/vllg.com\/incubator\/sharp-sans-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sharp Sans<\/a>. It looks great &#8212; that isn&#8217;t the problem &#8212; but, to me, it short-circuits the relationship between logo and applications.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/university_of_suffolk_prospectus_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for University of Suffolk by Only Studio\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/university_of_suffolk_prospectus_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for University of Suffolk by Only Studio\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/university_of_suffolk_prospectus_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for University of Suffolk by Only Studio\" \/>\n<figcaption>Prospectus.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The prospectus is what sold me on posting this project.
