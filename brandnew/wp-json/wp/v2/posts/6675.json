With a population of approximately 140,000, Rybnik is in the process of positive transformation and as part of the effort has introduced a new identity designed by Krak\u00f3w, Poland-based <a href=\"https:\/\/otwarte.com.pl\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">StudioOtwarte<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>&#8220;Rybnik&#8221; means a fish pond &#8211; historically, the city was famous for fish farming, hence the image of a pike in the coat of arms. However, the way in which the coat of arms was drawn made it impossible to simplify and use it in modern media. That is why it had to be drawn from scratch for the new visual identity. Drawn with a thicker line, the simplified &#8220;heraldic logo&#8221; can now be freely scaled and placed on various backgrounds and reproduced in different techniques.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/otwarte.com.pl\/pl\/portfolio\/Rybnik\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">StudioOtwarte project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video controls controlsList=\"nodownload\" autoplay loop muted playsinline><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/rybnik_icon_evolution.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Icon evolution.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/rybnik_icon_colors.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Rybnik by StudioOtwarte\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icon color variations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>Together with the logo, we have developed a system of markings for all municipal institutions and units of the Municipal Office. In the logotype and urban materials, we used Favela typeface designed by Mateusz Machalski. Blue colour from the municipal coat of arms was complemented by additional &#8220;Silesian&#8221; colors: black, red and yellow.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/otwarte.com.pl\/pl\/portfolio\/Rybnik\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">StudioOtwarte project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video controls controlsList=\"nodownload\" autoplay loop muted playsinline><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/rybnik_logo_system.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/rybnik_logo_system_a.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Rybnik by StudioOtwarte\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo system.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The new and old logos are based off of Rybnik&#8217;s coat of arms, which depicts a pike fish with a couple of floral patterns. Conceptually, not much to work with but, visually, it&#8217;s an interesting composition and intriguing combination of visuals &#8212; it&#8217;s not everyday you get to work with a fish that has, like, a 40:1 ratio and is set at a 45-degree angle. The old logo was hard to use with its thin lines, the fish had few discernible features, and the wordmark was too light and shy.<\/p>\n<p>The new logo introduces a much more deliberate and proud rendition of the fish, with strong facial features &#8212; I never thought I would be rhapsodizing about a pike&#8217;s face &#8212; and cool fins and swimmy parts. The floral patterns are much improved as well and in its main color combination, the white fill of the two elements stands out subtly and elegantly from the light blue background while the black strokes serve as a great accent. The new wordmark is bold and engaging with a low x-height that provides a good rhythm to the combination of characters.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/rybnik_grid_system.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Rybnik by StudioOtwarte\" \/>\n<figcaption>Grid system.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/rybnik_grid_system_layouts.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Rybnik by StudioOtwarte\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sample layouts.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The main lock-up of the logo places the wordmark vertically in relationship to the icon, which gives it a contemporary edge while making sure that the name of the city is the most visible and helping establish it as a better-known destination. The layouts are clean and simple with the extended typeface setting the connection with the logo.<\/p>\n<blockquote>The leitmotif of Rybnik&#8217;s visual identity are the illustrations inspired by stained-glass windows from the Rybnik Town Hall. Figures in stained glass windows depict allegories of industries traditionally associated with Rybnik: metallurgy, industry and commerce, urban community, mining and agriculture.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/otwarte.com.pl\/pl\/portfolio\/Rybnik\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">StudioOtwarte project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/rybnik_illustrations_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Rybnik by StudioOtwarte\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/rybnik_illustrations_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Rybnik by StudioOtwarte\" \/>\n<figcaption>Illustrations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The introduction of the illustrations makes for a great addition to the system as a further element of distinction to the destination and they will make for some pretty neat souvenir applications.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/rybnik_illustrations_tshirts.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Rybnik by StudioOtwarte\" \/>\n<figcaption>T-shirts.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/rybnik_city_icons.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Rybnik by StudioOtwarte\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icons.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/rybnik_stationery.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Rybnik by StudioOtwarte\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stationery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/rybnik_pencils.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Rybnik by StudioOtwarte\" \/>\n<figcaption>Pencils.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/rybnik_notebooks.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Rybnik by StudioOtwarte\" \/>\n<figcaption>Notebooks.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/rybnik_banners.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Rybnik by StudioOtwarte\" \/>\n<figcaption>Banners.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/rybnik_mug.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Rybnik by StudioOtwarte\" \/>\n<figcaption>Mug.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/rybnik_chairs.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Rybnik by StudioOtwarte\" \/>\n<figcaption>Lawn chairs.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">This identity does a great job of modernizing a quaint Polish town through the use of a clean and efficient design system while reveling in its history by maintaining the coat of arms as the core element and by celebrating and breathing new life into <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rybnik.eu\/mieszkaj\/aktualnosci\/aktualnosc\/nowa-identyfikacja-wizualna-rybnika\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the wicked stained glass decorations in its town hall<\/a>.
