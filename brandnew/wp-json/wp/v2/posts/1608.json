The AHA also publishes a bimonthly magazine, <em>Zymurgy<\/em>, and holds both a national-level homebrewers conference and competition. In turn, the AHA is a division of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.brewersassociation.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brewers Association<\/a>, a &#8220;not-for-profit trade association dedicated to promoting and protecting amateur and professional craft brewers.&#8221; So: small, beer, awesome. Earlier this month the AHA introduced a new logo designed in-house.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>The new logo incorporates several graphic elements that represent the fundamentals of the hobby, including a hop cone, a barley stalk and a tall glass of beer, on a circular background that evokes the shape of a bottle cap. AHA Director Gary Glass explains the design process: &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t easy, and the AHA staff and our graphic design team took the redesign seriously. We&#8217;re thrilled with this new visual representation of the AHA, our members and the broader homebrewing community.&#8221;<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.homebrewersassociation.org\/pages\/community\/news\/show?title=aha-announces-new-logo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Community News<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/aha_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"AHA Logo\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The old logo looked like it was homebrewed in a dark basement or on a dare by someone to use Mistral. Sarcasm aside, the logo felt more like a corporate mark for a brewing company than something that individuals could rally around. Plus the typography and barley illustration were just not pleasant. The new logo, although not perfect, is a vast improvement. I love that the holding shape is the shape of a bottle cap and the slightly extended typeface sits neatly in the circle. The barley and hop illustrations are a bit funky, but I think drawing any kind grain stalk is always hard. I would have tried to integrate the bottom of the tall glass a little better with the circle but it provides a strong centerpiece of attention to the logo. Overall, this is like a great beer-infused seal that would look great on t-shirts and is much more appropriate for the audience.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to Peter Kananen for the tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_110824_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_110824_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"574\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,79,26],"tags":[184,350,128,33],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1608"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1608"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1608\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1608"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1608"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1608"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
