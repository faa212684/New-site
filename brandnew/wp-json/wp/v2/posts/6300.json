The identity, designed by New York, NY-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.boyburnsbarn.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BoyBurnsBarn<\/a>, wastes no time in making the visual connection between the name of the establishment and the squat shape of the duckpin pin to draw a logo that&#8217;s, well, a duck-pin &#8212; it&#8217;s kind of satisfying in its straightforwardness of concept. The logo is complemented with a groovy, feathered monogram and a slew of funky typefaces that add some vintage\/hipster flavor to the place and give it a chic eccentricity.<span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.boyburnsbarn.com\/work\/the-painted-duck\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Souk by Mildred &amp; Duck<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_souk.jpg\" alt=\"Souk by Mildred &amp; Duck\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.soukmelbourne.com.au\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Souk<\/a> is a restaurant in Melbourne, Australia, serving Middle Eastern cuisine with flavors and dishes from Arabia, North Africa, and Anatolia.  The identity, designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/mildredandduck.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mildred &amp; Duck<\/a>, takes a few cues from the Middle East, most notably a logo that is meant to be read from right to left. I had to read the designers&#8217; description to understand why the logo was &#8220;flipped&#8221; as it wasn&#8217;t immediately clear when I first saw it. It&#8217;s a daring move but it pays off with what a cool wordmark it is. The identity also introduces a variation on the evil eye mark which adds a funky element to an already funky place filled with neon signs and plenty of attention to detail, including the logo debossed on custom-made plates. It&#8217;s all nicely thought out and has a great, weird vibe.  <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/mildredandduck.com\/souk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/the-brandidentity.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Via The Brand Identity<\/a><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">The Harbinger by Fuzzco<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_theharbinger.jpg\" alt=\"The Harbinger by Fuzzco\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theharbingercafe.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Harbinger<\/a> is a coffee house and bakery in Charleston, SC, making everything from scratch, all from a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/theharbingercafe\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mega-Instagram-able<\/a>, rustic location. The identity, designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/fuzzco.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fuzzco<\/a>, has a similar vibe with a funky combination of a script wordmark (which looks like crumble pie), a nature-y illustration (which looks like the start of a mushroom trip; not that I would know), and a super weird angled font that even though it has no logical business there it&#8217;s super awesome. It&#8217;s a little bit of everything, all blended in through the same blue, and oddly working together nicely. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/fuzzco.com\/work\/the-harbinger\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Some maximalist projects today for various food establishments with work from New York, Melbourne, and Charleston&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,85,26],"tags":[1065,597,564],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6300"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=6300"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6300\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=6300"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=6300"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=6300"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
