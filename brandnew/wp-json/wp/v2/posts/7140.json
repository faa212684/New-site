The identity, designed by Gold Coast, Australia-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.verg.com.au\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Verg<\/a>, is a lovely and energetic mix of lettering, iconography, and illustrations that come together very nicely in the cans. At first, the elements of each can seem like they won&#8217;t blend together but everything from the three bands in the background to the sideways logo to the badge to the hatchwork-y vehicle illustrations were meant to be together. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/72837461\/Slipstream-Brewing-Co\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Trinity Park Conservancy by Matchbox Studio<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_trinity_park_conservancy.jpg\" alt=\"Trinity Park Conservancy by Matchbox Studio\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/trinityparkconservancy.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Trinity Park Conservancy<\/a> is a nonprofit organization that supports and implements the recreational, economic development, and environmental stewardship components of the Trinity River Corridor Project that spans 20 miles along Dallas, TX. The identity, by local firm <a href=\"https:\/\/matchboxstudio.com\/work\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Matchbox Studio<\/a>, features a great drawing that blends a bird, a leaf, and some water-y waves into a single monoweight icon. It&#8217;s a very nicely balanced, asymmetrical icon that looks great on its own on t-shirts and caps but also pairs very well with the thin serif wordmark. It&#8217;s almost like a throwback logo of a simple icon, a smart font choice, and no bells or whistles. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/65916679\/Trinity-Park-Conservancy-Branding?tracking_source=curated_galleries_list\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Lucky Pickle Dumpling Co. by Eric&amp;Todd<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_lucky_pickle.jpg\" alt=\"Lucky Pickle Dumpling Co. by Eric&amp;Todd\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/luckypickledumpling.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lucky Pickle Dumpling Co.<\/a> is a new-ish, small-ish dumplings and noodle place in New York, NY. The identity, designed by Columbus, OH-based <a href=\"https:\/\/ericandtodd.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Eric&amp;Todd<\/a>, revolves around pickles. Or, well, illustrations of pickles paired with everything from the waving cat thing to pickles with shrimps, pickles with chicken, and pickles with unicorn-pigs. Playful and a little ludicrous with a deadpan execution, the illustrations make for a funky irreverent identity. As a bonus, there are high-fiving dumplings, and basketball-hooping noodle bowls. The supporting typography is nice too. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/ericandtodd.com\/work\/lucky-pickle\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"A range of illustration-leaning projects this week, with work from Gold Coast, Dallas, and Columbus&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,79,85,26],"tags":[325,292,1122,564],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7140"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=7140"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7140\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=7140"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=7140"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=7140"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
