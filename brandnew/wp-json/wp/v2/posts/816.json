Hart Brewing changed its name to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pyramidbrew.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pyramid Breweries<\/a> in 1996. This month, they will start selling their beer in newly designed bottles and boxes and introducing a new logo.<\/p><!--more--><p>The previous logo was strangely enough too specific to Egyptian pyramids, and I can&#8217;t tell if it was done ironically or not, there just doesn&#8217;t seem to be any strong reason for such an American-like beer and company to go after that look. So while the old logo looked more like a cover of <em>Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves<\/em> the new logo is unabashedly more American, even more Northwestern-ish and even Midwestern-ish, a working man&#8217;s and woman&#8217;s beer. The lines are cleaner, the type is bolder and the colors are more interesting. There is a slight disconnect in the style and line-width between the pyramids and the ribbon but overall it works well together. As the bottles below show, the logo looks better on a dark background, where the rays behind the pyramids, shine a little brighter.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pyramid_breweries_old.jpg\" alt=\"Pyramid Breweries Bottles, Old\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Old bottle design, and previous name, Pyramid Hefe Weizen, for the flagship beer now named Pyramid Haywire.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>There is also a new bottle and six-pack designs that use some hyper-stylized illustrations that introduce a completely different feeling from the logo. It may be someone else&#8217;s idea of good beer packaging, but it&#8217;s not mine and it feels like beginner&#8217;s beer, as opposed to beer from a 25-year-old brewery. Too much X-Games, not enough blue ribbon award winning.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pyramid_breweries_bottles.jpg\" alt=\"Pyramid Breweries Bottles, New\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pyramid_breweries_packs.jpg\" alt=\"Pyramid Breweries Packs, New\" \/><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,51,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/816"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=816"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/816\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=816"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=816"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=816"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
