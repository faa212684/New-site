But for those who are patiently waiting to be inspired to live their best lives the wait is now almost over. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.oprah.com\/own\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Oprah Winfrey Network<\/a> (OWN) will launch in January of 2011, coinciding a little bit better with Oprah putting a lid on her talk show, which goes off the air in late 2011 after 25 years of televised emotional tugs. OWN is set to replace the Discovery Health Channel and will be owned 50\/50 by Discovery Communication and Oprah&#8217;s production company Harpo. Earlier this month OWN unveiled its new look. For the third time.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/own_previous_logos.gif\" alt=\"Oprah Winfrey Network\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This post could have technically been a &#8220;Before\/After&#8221; rather than a &#8220;New&#8221; since the orange logo, above right, was used for a while. Nothing too exciting but not too offensive either. The logo to the left was used at launch, back in 2008, and was just a derivative of the <em>Oprah<\/em> logo. The new one has a voice of its own, for sure.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/own_logo_detail.jpg\" alt=\"Oprah Winfrey Network\" \/><\/p>\n<p>I fear I might be alone in this, but there is something I like about this logo. It&#8217;s not particularly pretty, or perfectly executed, or highly original, but there is something refreshing about the odd color combination, the sans serif living within the serif, even the dimensionality seems to signal the bigger-than-life personality of the woman behind the network. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I could live without the shading and towering effects but as far as mainstream, chicken-soup-for-the-soul-programming networks go this is fairly adventurous. As with most TV identity reveals, we will have to wait to see how it evolves and how it animates. Expect a follow-up post in January 2011. Unless the launch is delayed.
