What we decided makes the most sense is to have a Twitter not just for Brand New but for all of UnderConsideration, including the other blogs as well as our forays into client-driven work or publishing. The goal is to provide some insight about what goes on at UC headquarters &mdash; basically whatever me and Bryony are up to &mdash; and share what we are working on and doing.
