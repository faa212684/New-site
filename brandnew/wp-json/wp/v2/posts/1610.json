The prominent commercial development company has since  grown to include a variety of national and international clients. It  recently rebranded in order to better connect to its expanding audience  and more accurately communicate its offerings. According to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.studiodumbar.com\/main.php\">Studio Dumbar<\/a>, the company responsible for the redesign, the new logo is  intended to be a &ldquo;living identity&rdquo; &#8212; flexible enough to adjust to each  application, and symbolic of the unique strategy behind each project.<\/p> <!--more--><blockquote>OVG has a very  specific, authentic company culture, which has a lot to do with the  personality and charisma of Coen van Oostrom, the founder. In its way of  working, OVF is solid, reliable, well organized. The spirit of the  company is agile, entrepreneurial, fast-adapting, eager to find new,  better solutions. This unique combination is what makes the difference.<br \/><br \/>The new visual identity of OVG reflects this unique combination of  talents. The logo is like an icon, expressing straightforwardness,  reliability and strength. Projected on various shapes, the style becomes  a living identity, dynamic and adapting to new situations, just like  OVG&#8217;s approach to the projects it develops.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.studiodumbar.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Studio Dumbar Website<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p>The previous logo was not an accurate representation of the growing company. The  illustrated portrait suggested a one-man business (or possibly someone  selling designer eyewear). The lowercase type treatment felt informal,  especially in contrast to the rigid structure of the squared box. Least  successful was the lowercase tagline, which was awkwardly tracked out.<\/p>\n<p>The new  wordmark feels fresh and architectural, from the type treatment to the  way the identity is transformed in each iteration. The shade of blue, a  nod to the previous logo, is bright and contemporary. The only misstep  seems to be the choice of Futura as a secondary typeface, which, with  almost perfectly circular letterforms, conflicts with the condensed,  mathematical feel of the logo.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/OVG_logos.jpg\" width=\"574\" height=\"566\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Some current logo iterations<\/p>\n<p>The logo iterations are abstract but, as Studio Dumbar implied,<strong> <\/strong>each  appears to be tailored to a specific project; for instance, on the  annual report cover below, the kink in the &ldquo;O&rdquo; reflects the unique shape  of the bridge. It seems that OVG will have to develop a custom logo for  each project they take on, a difficult strategy to maintain in the long  term<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/OVG_annualreport.jpg\" width=\"574\" height=\"723\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Cover and interior page of an annual report<\/p>\n<p>The redesign includes a new tagline, &ldquo;re\/developers,&rdquo; which is intended  to draw attention to the development of both new and existing  properties. The new message is far more interesting than the previous,  more descriptive tagline, &ldquo;projectontwikkeling&rdquo;, (which translates from  Dutch as &ldquo;project development&rdquo;). Presumably, the use of English in the  tag is meant to appeal to international clients.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/OVG_Applications.jpg\" width=\"574\" height=\"714\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Additional applications<\/p>\n<p>Modeled type  seems to be popular these days, what with the creation of the new  <a href=\"http:\/\/current.com\/\">Current TV<\/a> identity, recently reviewed <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/current_lets_its_bold_flag_fly.php\">here<\/a>, and even Pentagram&#8217;s  identity for the <a href=\"http:\/\/pentagram.com\/en\/new\/2011\/06\/new-work-london-design-festiva-2.php#more\">2011 London Design Festival.<\/a> While perhaps not unique,  the type-driven look works well for the OVG brand. The identity lends  itself to animation, something Studio Dumbar assures me is on the way. I  look forward to seeing it.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_110825_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_110825_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_110825_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_110825_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_110825_config_03.xml&#038;xyz=poll_110825_votes_03.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv3\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv3\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":9,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,36,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1610"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/9"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1610"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1610\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1610"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1610"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1610"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
