A big part of its operation is education through eight training centers across the U.S., from New York to California. This month Counter Culture Coffee introduced new packaging designed in-house along with new naming for the year-round coffees.<\/p><!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/counter_culture_coffee_old_bags.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for Counter Culture Coffee done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sample of old packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>Conceived and developed by Counter Culture&#8217;s in-house design team, with work beginning in earnest in February 2014, the rebrand progressed at an accelerated pace. Each year-round product will have its own design variation for 12-ounce packaging, and all single-origin coffees&#8211;representing dozens of countries and farms&#8211;will go into a single bag design with differentiated labeling unique to each origin. Each vibrant, eye-catching color used is representative of a year-round product or single origin coffee, allowing buyers to easily distinguish the varieties, and each product has a unique texture and icon that is representative of that coffee. Additionally, the roast date appears in a more prominent location on all bags, further underlining Counter Culture&#8217;s commitment to quality and transparency.<\/blockquote><h3>Provided press release<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/counter_culture_coffee_packaging_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for Counter Culture Coffee done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>New line-up of packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/counter_culture_coffee_packaging_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for Counter Culture Coffee done In-house\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/counter_culture_coffee_packaging_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for Counter Culture Coffee done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Considering that the previous packaging was quite decent with its black bag and flexible structure, it&#8217;s even more impressive that the new packaging is a step up. While it has lost some of the illustrative opportunities to help differentiate products, the minimal and strikingly colored bags are quite delightful and attractive. The logo has been made bigger and is placed prominently in the white strip, providing more recognizability to the company itself. It&#8217;s a nice, simple logo set in Gotham and it works perfectly in the new design, complemented with Hoefler &amp; Co&#8217;s own Knockout. The color palette revolves around a navy blue for the logo and some info and then another single color (printed in screens) provides the secondary hues, making it a very efficient print job. The bright green stamp &mdash; like The Dude&#8217;s rug &mdash; ties it all together. It&#8217;s the right amount of splash that stands out and I love how it&#8217;s always placed at the intersection of the fields of color.<\/p>\n<blockquote>All 12-ounce whole-bean bags will be made of Biotre film, a material created by Pacific Bag Inc. at the forefront of sustainable, biodegradable packaging initiatives. Up to 60 percent of the material comes from renewable resources&#8211;shown to break down in well-managed compost environments in approximately 90 days&#8211;with the remaining materials breaking down in five to 10 years in a landfill.<\/blockquote><h3>Provided press release<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/counter_culture_coffee_packaging_05.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for Counter Culture Coffee done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>&#8220;Hologram&#8221; packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/counter_culture_coffee_packaging_04.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for Counter Culture Coffee done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Single origin packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/counter_culture_coffee_packaging_06.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for Counter Culture Coffee done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>&#8220;Slow Motion&#8221; in action.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/counter_culture_coffee_packaging_07.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for Counter Culture Coffee done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>&#8220;Forty-six&#8221; in action.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">Not really that much else to say.
