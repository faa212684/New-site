As of March, 2015, there are 1,650 locations worldwide &mdash; 70 of them outside the U.S. in places like Bahrain, Guatemala, Mexico, and the Philippines &mdash; of which 99% are owned by independent franchise operators and it employs more than 70,000 people. I have had breakfast at an IHOP maybe twice out of necessity and while clean and not horribly-tasting it&#8217;s not the pinnacle of the American culinary experience. (Or perhaps it is). It also has an unfortunate history of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.complex.com\/pop-culture\/2011\/04\/you-got-served-the-worst-fights-in-ihop-history\/orangeburg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">attracting fights<\/a>. I once showed a client a first round of logos at an IHOP in Waco, TX, which I should have taken as foreshadowing that he would bail on paying the remaining 50% of the project fee. Despite these misgivings, IHOP is a fruitful business, raking in over $3 <em>billion<\/em> in sales in 2014 and that&#8217;s reason enough for them to smile and introduce a new logo and identity designed by Kansas City, MO-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.studiotiltkc.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Studio Tilt<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><p>(Check back later in the day as we might be getting more visuals from Tilt, but I did want to get this post running first thing in the morning.)<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"red_100\">Update: New images from Tilt added at the end of the post.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote>For nearly 57 years, IHOP restaurants have helped millions of guests each week start their day with a smile.

It exemplifies the iconic family-friendly restaurant&#8217;s commitment to continually evolve its look, feel and offerings to maintain its position as the leading restaurant brand in its category and stay ahead of trends to meet and exceed current guest expectations. Featuring elements consistent with the heritage of the brand&#8211;including the recognizable blue and red color scheme&#8211;combined with a more modern look and the prominent smile, the logo is representative of the brand&#8217;s mission.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.multivu.com\/players\/English\/7428051-ihop-new-logo-launch\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">IHOP press release<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ihop_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo for IHOP by Studio Tilt\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Although the previous logo wasn&#8217;t an amazing piece of design, it was (it is) remarkably recognizable when you are on the road, be it in a city or highway. IHOPs are very easy to spot from miles away because of the short name and large footprint that the wordmark occupies. One thing I had never noticed &mdash; that IHOP&#8217;s VP of Marketing, Kirk Thompson, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.buzzfeed.com\/venessawong\/ihop-has-a-new-logo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">told BuzzFeed News<\/a> &mdash; is that the &#8220;RESTAURANT&#8221; descriptor in the logo looks like a sad face and once you see that you can&#8217;t really unsee it. In honor of BuzzFeed&#8217;s investigative reporting I&#8217;ve put together this alternate review of the logo change:<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ihop_logo_in_cats.gif\" alt=\"New Logo for IHOP by Studio Tilt\" \/>\n<figcaption>A cat version of the change.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ihop_signage.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for IHOP by Studio Tilt\" \/>\n<figcaption>Signage of a location near Cambridge, MA, photographed by BN reader Ian Lee.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>But back to the serious critique and grown-up analysis&hellip; The new logo is basically the same typography as before, liberated from its holding shape and the frown has literally been turned upside down to create a smile. It&#8217;s a cute idea but it starts to look too much like a kids-only restaurant or a children&#8217;s TV channel. While, yes, it is a family restaurant it now feels even less upscale than before. I appreciate smiles in logos but I don&#8217;t think this was the best case for it. Part of the problem is the execution, where the &#8220;op&#8221; are too thick in contrast to the smile, making the eyes look like they are bulging out of their sockets as if someone sniffed the powdered sugar off their pancakes. Nonetheless, the logo does benefit from being outside of the rectangle and happens to look quite decent on a coffee mug.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ihop_coffee.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for IHOP by Studio Tilt\" \/>\n<figcaption>New mug.

The mugs are nice and their website looks peppy and fresh. Despite my own lack of enthusiasm for the logo I do think this is a positive change for IHOP, even if it&#8217;s just to stay relevant and not feel like a 60-year-old brand, which might have more to do with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=ihop&#038;es_sm=91&#038;source=lnms&#038;tbm=isch&#038;sa=X&#038;ei=xo1tVZiHLMudsAXAhoOACw&#038;ved=0CAkQ_AUoAw&#038;biw=1524&#038;bih=866#tbm=isch&#038;q=ihop+building&#038;revid=779887664\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the look of some of its locations<\/a> than the logo &mdash; at least the buildings won&#8217;t look sad anymore.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><span class=\"red_100\">The following are new images provided after the post was originally published\/written.<\/span><\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ihop_stationery.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for IHOP by Studio Tilt\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stationery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ihop_icon_set_01.png\" alt=\"New Logo for IHOP by Studio Tilt\" \/>\n<figcaption>Rebus of International, House, of Pancakes.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ihop_icon_set_02.png\" alt=\"New Logo for IHOP by Studio Tilt\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icon set.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ihop_wall_type.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for IHOP by Studio Tilt\" \/>\n<figcaption>Wall decor, type.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ihop_wall_pattern.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for IHOP by Studio Tilt\" \/>\n<figcaption>Wall decore, smile pattern.
