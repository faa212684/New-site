With more than 3,100 facilities &mdash; that include over 180 retail stores (like big Walmarts) as well as more than 1,000 fast food restaurants like Taco Bell and Burger King &mdash; in Army and Air Force bases in the U.S. and more than 30 countries, AAFES&#8217;s majority of earnings are funneled back to the Morale, Welfare and Recreation (MWR)\/Services programs which, in 2009, amounted to more than $261 million. In September of last year AAFES introduced a new logo that reflected a change in name from AAFES to, simply, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.shopmyexchange.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the Exchange<\/a>. The identity and update to their retail program was done by Columbus, OH-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.chutegerdeman.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Chute Gerdeman<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>Graphic artists designed the logo with significant symbolism. The intersecting lines&#8211; called &#8220;chevrons&#8221;&#8211;are symbolic for the Army and Air Force branches coming together. Their shapes are used in both branches to acknowledge accomplishment and duty served with honor. &#8220;The name &#8216;Exchange&#8217; embraces the idea that AAFES gives back to the community with every transaction,&#8221; said Chief Operating Officer Michael Howard.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.shopmyexchange.com\/pa\/sept10expo.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>The Exchange Post<\/em><\/a><\/blockquote>\n<br \/>\n<blockquote>The new logo is graphically powerful, instantly identifiable, dimensional and meaningful:<br \/>&#8211; Two colors suggest the Army and Air Force coming together<br \/>&#8211; Exchange applies equally to both Army and Air Force<br \/>&#8211; The logo forms an &#8220;X,&#8221; which is visual shorthand for Exchange<br \/>&#8211; Red arrow suggests forward progress<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.prweb.com\/releases\/2010\/09\/prweb4530234.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press Release<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_exchange_alt_logo.gif\" alt=\"The Exchange\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Alternate lock-up.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_exchange_post.jpg\" alt=\"The Exchange\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Old and new cover for <em>The Exchange Post<\/em> newsletter.<\/p>\n<p>The old logo, a funny cross between the ESPN and G.I. Joe logos, was everything you would expect from an American military operation: red, blue, white, stars and stripes, and executed clumsily to boot. The new one is far more subtle in its Americanism and now looks a lot more like a retail brand and less like Operation Buy Stuff. The &#8220;X&#8221; icon is nicely done and the rounded corners match well with the softish sans serif below. What I like most about the change is that it became friendlier but without going the full-on &#8220;let&#8217;s be friends&#8221; aesthetic of lowercase rounded sans serifs. This still maintains some needed seriousness but drops the screaming General act.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"red\">Update:<\/span><\/strong> Photos below of the prototype store at Tinker Air Force Bace, photographed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.marksteelephotography.com\/portfolio\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mark Steele<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_Exchange_photo_01.jpg\" alt=\"The Exchange\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_Exchange_photo_02.jpg\" alt=\"The Exchange\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_Exchange_photo_03.jpg\" alt=\"The Exchange\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_Exchange_photo_04.jpg\" alt=\"The Exchange\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_Exchange_photo_05.jpg\" alt=\"The Exchange\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_Exchange_photo_06.jpg\" alt=\"The Exchange\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to Michael L.
