Essar Global employs over 40,000 people across offices in Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas.&#8221; Got it? They are big. And it&#8217;s corporate identity work like this that really gets me going.<\/p><!--more--><p>Not because it&#8217;s groundbreaking or necessarily the best design, but because it shows how it&#8217;s possible to evolve a brand without throwing all the equity overboard and still manage to infuse something new. Sometimes briefs  call for complete redesigns and that&#8217;s groovy, but other times a good old fashioned logo exercise that doesn&#8217;t result in the over-explanation of gradients and spheres is just what the client needs. But enough about that.<\/p>\n<p>The best part of the new logo is the evolution of those abstract maroon bars, using the same angles and structure, into a vibrant plus sign that punctuates the typography very nicely. I&#8217;m not as thrilled in the evolution of the typography though, I think the weight balance and the counterspaces of the old one were better resolved and that old &#8220;R&#8221; is to die for. The new one feels like a cross between the old one and Myriad. This is still better than a roundy, friendly, lowercase execution of course, so I shouldn&#8217;t complain too much.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rologo.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hsu Cennatian<\/a> for the tip.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,36,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/734"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=734"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/734\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=734"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=734"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=734"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
