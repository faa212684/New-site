The new company, Dell Technologies, will be the parent company to Dell, maintaining its consumer brand intact and officially the &#8220;Client Solutions sub-brand&#8221;; and to Dell EMC, which will be the &#8220;Enterprise Business sub-brand&#8221;. All three entities got new logos. No credit given <strike>but I believe it was done in-house, as there is a robust design team here in their Austin, TX headquarters<\/strike>.

Its 2010 touch-up was a somewhat effective evolution that, by placing the wordmark inside a circle, minimized the real estate the wordmark took, making the &#8220;E&#8221; less in your face. Considering its origin, it&#8217;s quite amazing that the new logo manages to look so good and that someone somewhere finally figured out how to make that &#8220;E&#8221; not suck. The new thickness of the letters and stroke hits the perfect density for the logo to look good at small and large sizes. It&#8217;s still a weird premise for a logo but this is the most sophisticated it has ever been and, dare I say it, cool.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/dell_2016_logo_before_after_technologies.png\" alt=\"New Logos for Dell, Dell Technologies, and Dell EMC by Brand Union\" \/>\n<figcaption>Dell and EMC before logos, with Dell Technologies after logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/dell_2016_logo_emc.png\" alt=\"New Logos for Dell, Dell Technologies, and Dell EMC by Brand Union\" \/>\n<figcaption>Dell EMC logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/dell_2016_all_logos.png\" alt=\"New Logos for Dell, Dell Technologies, and Dell EMC by Brand Union\" \/>\n<figcaption>All new logos and color configurations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/dell_2016_all_logos_subbrands.png\" alt=\"New Logos for Dell, Dell Technologies, and Dell EMC by Brand Union\" \/>\n<figcaption>The sub-brands of Dell Technologies.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/eIDvzFDOnpo\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Introduction to Dell Technologies.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The Dell Technologies and Dell EMC logos bring the wordmark back out of the circle and get paired with a simple, corporate sans serif and, again, looks surprisingly good.

Maybe a little <em>too<\/em> confident given the introduction video that the budget for capturing it was probably larger than what many of us charge for an identity project.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"gray_70\">* Our younger readers might have missed this: Back in the early 2000s, Dell had <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=8BsWijdM0W0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">these commercials where a dude finished the commercial by saying &#8220;Dude you&#8217;re Getting a Dell&#8221;<\/a> and it was a thing.
