This month, Stanley Park Brewing introduced a new identity designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/hiwill.ca\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Will<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>Knowing that the brewery, and the team behind it, looks to the Park for inspiration, it was a natural fit to bring the brand closer to the Park as well. Just like nature, the new look is simple and approachable at a glance, yet rich with substance upon a closer look. It features illustrated park scenes in a restrained palette, a logo mark inspired by the shape of the park, and a typeface whose natural, stick-inspired letterforms are derived from a historical Stanley Park sign.<\/blockquote><h3>Will provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/stanley_park_brewing_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Stanley Park Brewing by Will\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/stanley_park_brewing_logo_render.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Stanley Park Brewing by Will\" \/>\n<figcaption>Full-render version.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo featured a depiction <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=Lions+Gate+Bridge&#038;lr=lang_en&#038;tbs=lr:lang_1en&#038;source=lnms&#038;tbm=isch&#038;sa=X&#038;ved=0ahUKEwjw8cjO6a3TAhVi_4MKHYg-DmoQ_AUICSgC&#038;biw=1304&#038;bih=864#lr=lang_en&#038;tbs=lr:lang_1en&#038;tbm=isch&#038;q=Lions+Gate+Bridge+lion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">of the statues<\/a> found at one of the ends of the Lions Gate Bridge that leads into Stanley Park. It was a nice engraving and the full badge was convincingly done. The new logo is a major aesthetic departure, going from the more classic regal\/seal look of before to an outdoorsy\/lumberjack-y aesthetic. The change is so drastic I had to triple-check this was the same brewery and not two different ones that happened to be named the same.<\/p>\n<p>I like public parks and hiking and stuff, so I very much like the park-inspired wood-carved typography and minimal tree illustrations but I wonder if that&#8217;s set to alienate some of the audience? Without knowing how popular this beer is among locals it&#8217;s all speculation but I do think it now speaks to a VERY specific audience &#8212; no flannel, no beer for you &#8212; as opposed to the old logo (and packaging) that was kind of general\/generic. Still, I dig the new logo and it stands out much more than the old one, even though that one had a thousand more vector points calling for attention.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/stanley_park_brewing_old_look.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Stanley Park Brewing by Will\" \/>\n<figcaption>Old packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/stanley_park_brewing_new_look.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Stanley Park Brewing by Will\" \/>\n<figcaption>New packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old packaging was also pretty solid and the round seal logo was a nicely implemented component in the bottle and 6-packs. (The previous logo and packaging were designed by New York, NY-based <a href=\"http:\/\/beardwood.com\/blog\/2011\/09\/21\/stanley-park-noble-pilsner-2\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Beardwood&amp;Co<\/a>.) The new packaging takes on a much lighter, airier, more flowing illustration style that evokes <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=mid+century+travel+poster&#038;source=lnms&#038;tbm=isch&#038;sa=X&#038;ved=0ahUKEwiYysC97K3TAhVh4IMKHbo4DxQQ_AUIBigB&#038;biw=1304&#038;bih=864#imgrc=_\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mid-century travel posters<\/a>, each in lovely monotone palettes and complemented by script typography on the names. The illustrations are beautiful and the integration with the logo in the bottle, 6-pack, and can is very well achieved.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/stanley_park_brewing_windstorm.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Stanley Park Brewing by Will\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/stanley_park_brewing_daytrip.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Stanley Park Brewing by Will\" \/>\n<figcaption>Windstorm and Daytrip detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/stanley_park_bottles_IRL_all_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Stanley Park Brewing by Will\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/stanley_park_bottles_IRL_all_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Stanley Park Brewing by Will\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/stanley_park_bottles_IRL_windstorm.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Stanley Park Brewing by Will\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/stanley_park_bottles_IRL_amber_ale.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Stanley Park Brewing by Will\" \/>\n<figcaption>Bottles IRL.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/stanley_park_bottles_IRL_pints.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Stanley Park Brewing by Will\" \/>\n<figcaption>Pints.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/stanley_park_ads.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Stanley Park Brewing by Will\" \/>\n<figcaption>Ads.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">With such a strong visual departure, the new look had to be confident enough to convince existing clients to follow them in this new direction and unless anyone <em>hates<\/em> the woods, this is a fantastic direction that separates this beer from the traditional beer look (but, granted, places them closer with the craft, hipper-than-Bud beer look).<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 2009, Stanley Park Brewing is a craft brewery in Vancouver, Canada.
