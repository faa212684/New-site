In 1982, it launched an office and consumer products division, simply <a href=\"http:\/\/www.avery.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Avery<\/a>, bringing some of its innovations to the marketplace and is what most of us recognize as Avery and its famed Saul Bass clip logo. On July 2013, Toronto-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cclind.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CCL Industries<\/a> purchased the office and consumer product division from Avery Dennison and in order to establish distance from its original ownership, CCL introduced a new logo for the consumer Avery brand, designed by New York, NY-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cgstudionyc.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Chermayeff &amp; Geismar &amp; Haviv<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>Avery came to Chermayeff &amp; Geismar &amp; Haviv [&#038;hellip] for a new visual identity that would more clearly distinguish it from Avery Dennison; be modern and forward-looking; and yet also retain the brand&#8217;s recognition in the marketplace. In an additional challenge, the new logo had to work within Avery&#8217;s existing package design, which was to remain unchanged. The firm&#8217;s solution &mdash; a tilted red square positioned behind a redrawn Avery wordmark &mdash; recalls Avery&#8217;s tilted square while placing the emphasis squarely on the name.<\/blockquote><h3>Provided press release<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/avery_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo for Avery by Chermayeff &amp; Geismar &amp; Haviv\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p><strong>To clarify<\/strong>: The Saul Bass clip logo still exists and is still part of Avery Dennison. Yet despite that clarification, the inevitable name\/logo confusion is a problem, none of which is C&amp; G &amp; H&#8217;s fault; it&#8217;s just one of those unfortunate situations where legacy names have different meanings in the business-to-business side and the business-to-consumer site.<\/p>\n<p>With that in mind, C&amp;G&amp;H have done a great job in maintaining a little bit of the visual equity of the old logo &mdash; the tilted Saul Bass clip (which was titled by Avery Dennison to signal the difference between its B2B and B2C logos) &mdash; by using a simple red, tilted square behind a new extended wordmark. It&#8217;s not a POW!-kind of logo, it just gets the job done with enough character of its own. I particularly like the diagonal &#8220;Y&#8221; approach that creates a nicer ending that matches the opening &#8220;A&#8221;. We also usually complain about the placement of &trade; and &reg; marks; this one is unobtrusive.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/avery_packaging.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Avery by Chermayeff &amp; Geismar &amp; Haviv\" \/>\n<figcaption>Packaging.

The logo had to fit in the existing packaging templates and just be able to be dropped in. So there is some dissonance between the new, clean logo and the existing, weird mixture of typefaces and colors. Overall, it&#8217;s a change that makes sense and has been carried out efficiently and elegantly.<\/p>\n<p>And, now, hopefully as the first of many to come, we welcome <a href=\"http:\/\/www.identityworks.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tony Spaeth<\/a>&#8216;s comments in:<\/p>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #f50a0a;padding: 3.75% 3.75% 0 3.75%;margin:0 0 30px 0\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/_images\/tony_spaeth_pic.jpg\" alt=\"Tony Spaeth\" style=\"float:left;padding:0 3.75% 10px 0;width:120px\" \/><p style=\"color:#808080;\"><span class=\"h1 red_100 rb_1_r100\" style=\"display:inline-block;margin:-3px 0 10px 0; padding:5px 0 0 0;\">Tony&#8217;s Take<\/span><br \/>There is a law of branding &mdash; call it the Not All Ours law &mdash; that says &#8220;It&#8217;s never a good idea to use a mark you don&#8217;t completely own,&#8221; or to rely on names or logos (no matter how familiar or beloved) whose future meaning you can&#8217;t fully control.<\/p><p style=\"color:#808080;\">Violations, or at least vulnerabilities, are often triggered when companies spin out a branded business, yet retain for themselves vestiges of the spun-out brand. We see this in Avery Dennison&#8217;s spinout (last July) of its Avery-branded consumer products division, which included rights to continued (but not exclusive) use of the Avery name&hellip; rights to the name, that is, but evidently not the symbol. In addition to retaining the &#8220;Avery&#8221; in its own name, Avery Dennison chose to keep for itself the Bass-designed paperclip &#8220;A&#8221; symbol. At first, the spun-out Avery presumed to keep its red A too, containing it in a canted blue box in hopes of differentiating it from Avery Dennison&#8217;s red A &mdash; but no dice, so Avery then agreed &#8220;to represent ourselves in a different way,&#8221; thus triggering the nicely executed Chermayeff &amp; Geismar &amp; Haviv assignment.<\/p><p style=\"color:#808080;\">As the dust settles, we now have two Avery&#8217;s in the office products category, each with a brand &#8220;Not All Ours,&#8221; thus each at the mercy of the other&#8217;s future behavior, performance and reputation.<\/p><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1935 as Kum Kleen Products (!), later renamed Avery Adhesives in 1937 until 1990 (with a few variations) when it merged with Dennison Manufacturing, Avery Dennison is a global producer of labeling and packaging materials and solutions with&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,51,26],"tags":[908,695,309,657,1035],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3178"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3178"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3178\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3178"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3178"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3178"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
