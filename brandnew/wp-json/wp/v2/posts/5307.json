Earlier this year, Sustain Natural introduced a new logo and packaging designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/karimrashid.com\/projects\/#category_5\/project_1045\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Karim Rashid<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sustain_natural_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Sustain Natural by Karim Rashid\" \/>\n<figcaption>Wordmark.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo had the right idea &#8212; although I&#8217;m not sure a drop of lube is necessarily a good idea in general as the key element of a logo &#8212; but the execution was awkward and the slab serif didn&#8217;t feel sensuous in any way. Not that the new wordmark does but the rounded sans serif is at least smoother and friendlier, like something you would like to, you know, play with. Still, the wordmark is not the key element of this identity.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sustain_natural_icon.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Sustain Natural by Karim Rashid\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icon.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The icon is abstract but it also doesn&#8217;t require much imagination to understand what it&#8217;s trying to represent &#8212; at first glance, two lips, yes, but beyond that, the interlocking of multiple other possible body parts. It&#8217;s a good-looking icon and it has a playful sensuality to it that works in the context of the product&#8230; if you changed the colors to green and blue it could easily be a healthcare logo. Another cool thing about the icon is that it serves as the center point for the illustrations in the packaging.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sustain_natural_old_packaging.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Sustain Natural by Karim Rashid\" \/>\n<figcaption>Old packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sustain_natural_packaging_before_after.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Sustain Natural by Karim Rashid\" \/>\n<figcaption>Lubricant product, before and after.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The bold new packaging design is an extension of Sustain&#8217;s mission to de-stigmatize issues around women&#8217;s sexual and reproductive health. It features two abstract faces with no distinct facial features to give a sense of gender and sexual freedom, which are joined together by their lips to form two interlocking hearts, conveying the passionate sensation of desire and love.<\/blockquote><h3>Sustain Natural provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sustain_natural_packaging_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Sustain Natural by Karim Rashid\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sustain_natural_packaging_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Sustain Natural by Karim Rashid\" \/>\n<figcaption>New packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old packaging had the same problem as the logo in that it looked clinical and, um, dry. Its minimalism was nice but the few graphic elements it had made it look more like some random skin cream. The new packaging revolves around the two ambiguous figures locking lips and instantly conveys a playful look and makes it clear what the product is for. The wordmark sits somewhat oddly at the top and could have probably been a tad smaller to give that area more breathing room. The USDA Organic logo is a little&#8230; prominent. On the orange and blue packaging, I&#8217;m guessing the thick blue lines are some unfortunate overprinting. I like how the left figure can change colors for different flavors\/smells.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sustain_natural_packaging_hero_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Sustain Natural by Karim Rashid\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sustain_natural_packaging_hero_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Sustain Natural by Karim Rashid\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sustain_natural_packaging_hero_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Sustain Natural by Karim Rashid\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sustain_natural_packaging_hero_04.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Sustain Natural by Karim Rashid\" \/>\n<figcaption>Hero shots.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">Overall, this is a major design and overall personality improvement to a line of products and a company that are doing more than the <em>bare<\/em> minimum in quality and contributions to others beyond their bottom line.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 2013, Sustain Natural is a brand of all-natural sexual wellness products that includes condoms, lube, wipes, massage oil, balm, and body wash.
