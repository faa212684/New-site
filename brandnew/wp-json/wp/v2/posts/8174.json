Peter and Paul Catholic church and school &#8212; dating back to the nineteenth century. The identity, designed by New York, NY-based <a href=\"http:\/\/alizeefreudenthal.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Aliz\u00e9e Freudenthal<\/a> features some great typography with the logo set in a free font, <a href=\"https:\/\/fontmeme.com\/fonts\/atari-peter-olexa-font\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Atari<\/a> by Peter Olexa, that nicely evokes the weathered, historic vibe of the hotel. The yellow color is unexpected for a hotel but it provides a great contemporary touch. Mixed in throughout are funky illustrations depicting both religious- and New Orleans-inspired motifs. The hotel itself is stunning and a little bizarre and the identity aptly supports that. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/alizeefreudenthal.com\/hotel-peter-and-paul\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">LookBooks by Studio Lowrie<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_lookbooks.jpg\" alt=\"LookBooks by Studio Lowrie\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.lookbooks.store\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LookBooks<\/a> is an online store selling what they call &#8220;old kinda fun books&#8221; which are the best kind of books and to make them even more kinda fun, London, UK-based <a href=\"https:\/\/studiolowrie.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Studio Lowrie<\/a> created a silly wordmark (which you can see at their website) where the numerous &#8220;O&#8221;s are turned into cartoony eyes. Unlike the creepy <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ihop.com\/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">IHOP<\/a> approach of turning round letters into empty-looking eyes, these are so full of personality and a knowing wink that the execution is very lo-fi. The bookmarks are genius with the die-cut tab serving as either the nose or the mouth of the eyes depending on what side you see. The yellow and red color palette is, like the project above, completely unexpected but very entertaining. The image with the taped box makes me think of DHL losing its composure and going all kinds of crazy with its identity &#8212; which would be a fun thing to witness. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/studiolowrie.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Bodha by Studio L&#8217;Ami<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_bodha.jpg\" alt=\"Bodha by Studio L'Ami\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/bodha.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bodha<\/a> is a therapeutic perfumer creating its own scents and products like aromatherapy eye pillows &#8212; I could go for one of those right about now &#8212; ritual diffusers and oils, and smokeless incense. The identity, designed by Los Angeles, CA-based  <a href=\"https:\/\/studio-lami.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Studio L&#8217;Ami<\/a>, has a minimalist aesthetic that has been beautifully produced in a rich set of colored boxes and wraps with a single embossed box to offset the logo.
