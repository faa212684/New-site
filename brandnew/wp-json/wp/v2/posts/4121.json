I have little information on this so we&#8217;ll have to roll along with it: Mao Er&#8217; is a cultural and creative district in the western Chinese city of ChongQing trying to be positioned as a cultural, shopping, and tourism destination. Told you I had little information but the work is a trip, so that might make up for it. The identity for the project was designed by Beijing-based <a href=\"http:\/\/gdp-partner.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">g.d.partner<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>The brand idea comes from a legend story of the project site, a cat from the heaven ran to the bank of the river and fell asleep and turned to a stone, so the names is called maoer shi(stone). We referred Chongqing local language pronunciation to make the name of the project: meow Er shi- a dynamic name. We want to make the legend of the story into a new legend.<br \/><br \/>There are lots of brand images using cat, how to create a unique cat image and to meet the project&#8217;s properties and positioning, is the biggest challenge we face and the most exciting part.<\/blockquote><h3>Provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/A2ifJ0cLtAY\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Project overview.

It&#8217;s based on a legend of a cat that came from the heaven to the district, ran, fell asleep, and turned to stone. Hence, cats. With that in mind, I find the logo to be quite endearing and well thought-out. As a standalone rendering of a cat it&#8217;s interesting enough but with the ears and face making an &#8220;M&#8221; it becomes more appropriate. The accompanying typography is okay, it fits with the cat drawing but maybe feels too techno-y. The logo turns flexible in three stylings: as a thin stroke with silhouetted imagery in it, as a solid shape made of patterns, and as the usual logo-as-window. I wish they had figured a way to integrate the tail of the cat from the main logo as that&#8217;s a big part of what makes it work. Nonetheless, a cat logo with jumping cats coming out of it will always get my attention.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/miao_er_prototypes_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Mao Er&amp;apos; by g.d.partners\" \/>\n<figcaption>Prototypes of various materials.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/miao_er_prototypes_bags.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Mao Er&amp;apos; by g.d.partners\" \/>\n<figcaption>Bags.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/miao_er_real_brochure.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Mao Er&amp;apos; by g.d.partners\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brochure.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/miao_er_real_sign.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Mao Er&amp;apos; by g.d.partners\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sign.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/miao_er_real_billboards.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Mao Er&amp;apos; by g.d.partners\" \/>\n<figcaption>Billboards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/miao_er_real_various.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Mao Er&amp;apos; by g.d.partners\" \/>\n<figcaption>Various printed materials.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">In application, despite a seemingly random range of directions it all makes sense when seen together as in the image above. There are a lot of diagonals, there are times with the patterned logo is used always on the bottom right corner, there is a questionable &#8220;Cool Fun! Cool Play!&#8221; tagline that mass some appearances, and it&#8217;s all colorful as a cat on acid. This is far from the typical work we see on Brand New and it&#8217;s not perfect but, sometimes, seeing this kind of unbridled excitement and looseness is a good reminder that not everything has to be buttoned up.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"And now for something completely different.
