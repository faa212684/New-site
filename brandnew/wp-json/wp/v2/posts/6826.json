Designed by the brand&#8217;s own Creative Director at the time, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.garciacarceles.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Antonio Garc\u00eda C\u00e1rceles<\/a>, the identity takes a simple Futura wordmark &#8212; which, yes, is just like every other fashion brand today &#8212; and infuses it with a lot of playfulness by adding funky fonts, hipster-y illustrations, and a 1980s-tastic color palette of pink, yellow, and blue &#8212; the store design shown at the link is probably worth a pilgrimage for any Kling fan. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/69161567\/KLING?tracking_source=curated_galleries_list\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">LADFEST 2018 by IS Creative Studio<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_ladfest4.jpg\" alt=\"LADFEST 2018 by IS Creative Studio\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/ladfest.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LADFEST<\/a> (short for Latin American Design Festival), now in its fourth edition, is one of the leading design festivals in Latin America, spearheaded by <a href=\"http:\/\/iscreativestudio.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">IS Creative Studio<\/a>, who also design the event&#8217;s materials.

Combined with an extended style of Druk and Fifty, a weird sans serif from ECAL Typefaces, the applications are bold, exciting, and unique. A special tip of the hat for the tote bags that bleed off the edges &#8212; it&#8217;s easy to do in Photoshop but surprisingly difficult in real life. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/68810971\/Latin-American-Design-Festival-2018\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Hembu by Bienal Comunicaci\u00f3n<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_hembu.jpg\" alt=\"Hembu by Bienal Comunicaci\u00f3n\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/hembu.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hembu<\/a> is a retail shop in M\u00e9rida, Mexico, specializing in health and beauty products from Korea and Japan. Designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/bienal.mx\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bienal Comunicaci\u00f3n<\/a>, the identity plays off of the name &#8212; that uses the root of the Korean word for happiness &#8212; to create thin-line smiley face where the mouth is complemented by the words &#8220;Korea&#8221; (where the eyes are) and &#8220;Japan&#8221; (where the nose is). You will have to excuse me that I don&#8217;t know in which language each is written. I do know that it makes me smile. The execution of the logo is very well done and it does create a feeling of don&#8217;t-worry-be-happy-and-have-smooth-skin. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/bienal.mx\/es\/portafolio\/72\/hembu-skincare\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Two thin-line and airy identities serve as metaphorical parenthesis for a bold identity this week, with work from Madrid, Lima, and M\u00e9rida&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[63,11,86,26],"tags":[580,906,1299],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6826"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=6826"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6826\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=6826"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=6826"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=6826"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
