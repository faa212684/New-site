Diet Coke was originally the first brand other than Coca-Cola itself to carry the giant&#8217;s name. Today, of course, there is like a dozen Coca-Cola This or Coca-Cola That. This coming September, to celebrate Coca-Cola&#8217;s 125th anniversary, the company will be introducing a limited-edition design of Diet Coke that will be on shelves for an as of yet undisclosed period of time. Could be three months, could be three decades. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.adweek.com\/news\/advertising-branding\/diet-coke-gets-new-look-fall-134138\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Adweek first broke the story<\/a>. The design is by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.turnerduckworth.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Turner Duckworth<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><p>Images below found through <a href=\"http:\/\/nfgraphics.com\/rediseno-de-coca-cola-light-por-turner-duckworth\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">nfgraphics.com<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/dietcoke_can_detail.jpg\" alt=\"Diet Coke\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/dietcoke_can_double.jpg\" alt=\"Diet Coke\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/dietcoke_package.jpg\" alt=\"Diet Coke\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This is a great redesign that falls in line with the latest Coca-Cola cans (also by Turner Duckworth): absolute simplicity and boldness. No visual fizz, no gratuitous waves, no fake sweat drops. Just a big-ass Diet Coke logo. It&#8217;s amazing how instantly recognizable it is. It reminds me a little bit of the new Starbucks redesign, where the kraft slip-ons for the heat feature a very tight close-up of the mermaid, elevating the logo to icon status. There is so much focus on the Coca-Cola logo being one of the most recognizable in the world but, as this design proves, the Diet Coke logo isn&#8217;t a second-tier pushover.<\/p>\n<p>I also like how at a given angle of the can you can see a big &#8220;ok&#8221;. Not sure if that was intentional, but it&#8217;s great. The only thing that seems weird is that the full &#8220;Diet Coke&#8221; logo is repeated three times. Might be two too many and it was probably required by legal: &#8220;But how will people know what they are drinking? It needs the logo here, here, and here.&#8221; I hope &#8220;limited-edition&#8221; is code for &#8220;We are testing this out on a massive scale to see if people freak out or not&#8221; and keep the cans on the market. It&#8217;s a much more interesting look than the current.<\/p>\n<p>An edited version of the opinion above <a href=\"http:\/\/www.adweek.com\/news\/advertising-branding\/grading-diet-cokes-makeover-134315\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">first appeared on Adweek<\/a>.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_110829_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_110829_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"574\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,51,26],"tags":[614,53,594],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1613"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1613"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1613\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1613"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1613"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1613"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
