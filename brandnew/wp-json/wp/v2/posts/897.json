I have never been eager to post scoops based on limited information. Nothing wrong with it, but it&#8217;s just not what we do. A new Nickelodeon wordmark, replacing the famous &#8220;splat&#8221; flexible identity, has appeared in a few random places but not yet on the main Nickelodeon site and it probably won&#8217;t until early Fall as new programming kicks in. You can feel free to comment about the new logo here on Brand New, but I&#8217;ll say that it would be premature. I&#8217;ve started a conversation with a couple of nice folks at Nickelodeon and I hope to have a fuller story in the coming weeks, if not months.
