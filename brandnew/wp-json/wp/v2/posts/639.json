Starbucks\" \/><\/p>\n<div class=\"in_brief\"><a href=\"http:\/\/seattlepi.nwsource.com\/business\/364425_sbuxlogo24.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Seattle&#8217;s Rat City Rollergirls of the Women&#8217;s Flat Track Derby Association are facing opposition from their hometown coffee empire, Starbucks<\/a>. When the Rollergirls attempted to register their logo so that they could be included in a videogame, conflict arose. Starbucks asked the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to hold off on registering the Rollergirls logo as they might oppose the filing &mdash; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/in_brief_ilitigious.php\">just like Apple did recently against GreeNYC<\/a>. It&#8217;s hard to not admit the similarities in construction of the logo, but they are decidedly of different <em>spirit<\/em>. I would guess it would be in the best interest of good will that Starbucks not be a-holes on this one. Plus, any logo that dares to put Verdana on a curve deserves to stick around.
