Last month, without much fanfare, Facebook introduced a revised version of its &#8220;f Logo&#8221; which is meant to be used to promote an organization&#8217;s or person&#8217;s presence on Facebook. It&#8217;s ubiquitous &mdash; yet I had never realized there was, officially, a lighter blue line at the bottom of it. Along with the new &#8220;f Logo&#8221; also comes an official <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebookbrand.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">brand page<\/a> and a revised set of icons for all the different services\/pages found throughout the Facebook universe. Obviously this is not the most earth-shattering change in the history of logo changes but it&#8217;s my duty to report on it, since, like, a billion people use Facebook.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/facebook_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"Facebook Changes\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">The &#8220;f Logo&#8221; in detail. You probably don&#8217;t need to see it that big but there it is.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/facebook_badges.gif\" alt=\"Facebook Changes\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">For the record, these are the official &#8220;Thumbs Up&#8221;, &#8220;Like Button&#8221;, and &#8220;Find Us on Facebook Badge&#8221; assets.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/facebook_no_download.png\" alt=\"Facebook Changes\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Interestingly, you can&#8217;t download the Facebook logo from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebookbrand.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the assets page<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>So, yeah, there is no more lighter blue line. And the world keeps chugging along. I don&#8217;t even know why it was there in the first place. In the new version the &#8220;f&#8221; bleeds out and becomes bigger, which is very helpful since people are using the social sharing icons in really tiny dimensions now that there is dozens of icons to share stuff with. What&#8217;s more interesting about this whole story is Facebook making a more conscious effort to establish what&#8217;s right and wrong since so many people have just grabbed unofficial icons off Google image searches or just created their own (I know I have) &mdash; and also now that Twitter has upped its game graphically, Facebook can&#8217;t rest on its laurels. And for a site that changes design every other month and where every platform experience feels different (and almost alien to each other) perhaps this is a sign that things are about to get more consistent. The icons shown below are also a good indication of a graphic standard being set in place. And that can only be promising. Unless they change everything again in a few months, which wouldn&#8217;t be surprising.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/facebook_logo_icons.gif\" alt=\"Facebook Changes\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Logos\/icons for other large pages\/sections\/services from Facebook.
