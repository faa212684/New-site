Its main airport is Schiphol in Amsterdam with a French hub in Paris&#8217; Orly airport. Their fleet of over 30 airplanes flies more than five million passengers a year to approximately 80 destinations from Dubai to Berlin to Barcelona. Yesterday, Transavia dropped the &#8220;.com&#8221; from its name and introduced a new identity designed by Rotterdam-based <a href=\"http:\/\/studiodumbar.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Studio Dumbar<\/a>.<\/p> <!--more--><blockquote>We began by developing Transavia&#8217;s new positioning. The two most important results: changing the name from transavia.com to Transavia (.com is too pass&eacute;), and defining &#8220;It&#8217;s a pleasure&#8221; as the leading principle for the company. The design is playful, accessible and flexible.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/studiodumbar.com\/work\/transavia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Studio Dumbar project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/transavia_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Livery for Transavia by Studio Dumbar\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The previous logo was typeset in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.myfonts.com\/fonts\/itc\/bauhaus\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ITC Bauhaus<\/a>, which should serve as enough lack of credentials to function as an effective airline identity. (It&#8217;s great if you are promoting <em>Boogie Nights<\/em>, though). Regardless of the specific font, the logo exuded too much low-fare airline vibe and the &#8220;.com&#8221; didn&#8217;t help at all. The new logo is&hellip; it&#8217;s not exactly clear what it is. It&#8217;s definitely a &#8220;t&#8221;, obvs, and the animation in the video below hints at it being a crosshair that blends into a &#8220;t&#8221;. Without the animation it&#8217;s just a slightly deformed &#8220;t&#8221; which I&#8217;m not trying to imply as a complaint since I really like the funky shape but there is some clarity missing from the first impression. The new wordmark looks like some off-shoot of a Lineto font, which is not a bad thing either but it is kind of expected nowadays.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/117597897?byline=0\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Brand launch video.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>A special feature is the application of icons to the underbelly of Transavia&#8217;s planes, with a different combination of icons for each plane in the fleet. Another symbolic livery feature appears next to the entrance, where the word &#8216;Welcome&#8217; is written in all the languages of the countries served by Transavia. The identity continues to roll out across uniforms, catering trolleys, in-flight amenities and more, with a new website &mdash; developed by Mirabeau &mdash; to follow soon.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/studiodumbar.com\/work\/transavia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Studio Dumbar project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/transavia_livery.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Livery for Transavia by Studio Dumbar\" \/>\n<figcaption>Livery, before and after.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/transavia_livery_detail.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Livery for Transavia by Studio Dumbar\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/transavia_livery_detail_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Livery for Transavia by Studio Dumbar\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/transavia_livery_detail_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Livery for Transavia by Studio Dumbar\" \/>\n<figcaption>Livery detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/transavia_livery_door.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Livery for Transavia by Studio Dumbar\" \/>\n<figcaption>Door detail. A few more launch photos on <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/transaviaFR\/media\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">their Twitter account<\/a>.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The new livery picks up the basic layout of the old one with the monogram on the tail and the name across the fuselage. Nice and simple. The real treat in the new livery is a customized belly, where each airplane will have a different set of icons painted along with the monogram. They might be hard to discern when a plane flies over you but it&#8217;s fun nonetheless. The belly of the airplane has turned out to be the most fun canvas in airline identity design in the last ten years.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/transavia_car.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Livery for Transavia by Studio Dumbar\" \/>\n<figcaption>Car.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/transavia_cracker_pack.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Livery for Transavia by Studio Dumbar\" \/>\n<figcaption>Cracker packet.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/transavia_flappy_things.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Livery for Transavia by Studio Dumbar\" \/>\n<figcaption>Banner-y things.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">In application, the identity uses a very vibrant color palette revolving around the main green to render a wide variety of simple icons, illustrations, and typographic bon mots that are delivered in little pill shapes and rounded-corner rectangles. At times it feels a little <em>too<\/em> clean and minimal but I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s 30,000 feet above whatever Transavia had before. Overall, this communicates a fun attitude that maintains the low-fare aesthetics with a dash of sophistication.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"First flown in 1966, Transavia is a Dutch low-fare airline that operates as an independent company within the Air France-KLM group.
