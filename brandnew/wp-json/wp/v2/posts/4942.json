Circles, fragments of circles, and curves inside circles come together in charming illustrations to serve as the backgrounds for the packaging full of goodness. Not shown in the image above but available at the link is a nice extension of the system from the opaque ice cream pints to the transparent popsicle bags. The logo can sometimes take up too much space and block the illustration but, in the larger pints, it strikes the right balance. Bonus points for the paper shapes created for photographing the project. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/38145443\/La-luz-del-Dia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Perro by Copo<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_perropapel.jpg\" alt=\"Perro by Copo\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/perro_taller\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Perro<\/a> is a small business dedicated to party and event decoration with a penchant for paper. The name does translate to &#8220;dog&#8221; in English but it&#8217;s also Mexican slang for something that&#8217;s &#8220;bitchin'&#8221;. The slang is not typically associated with party decorations, more like a great, spicy taco or someone that slam dunks a lot. Anyway, the mash-up of dog and paper come together beautifully in a logo by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.holacopo.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Copo<\/a> that depicts a hairy dog as if it were made of paper strips and sets a chic, sophisticated tone for the company &#8212; it wouldn&#8217;t be the same if they had chose to depict a bulldog. The salmon and blue palette is quite nice and the snowflakes on the print materials are festive. The condensed serif used for not-sure-what-those-are looks great as it&#8217;s trying to burst out of the paper. I wouldn&#8217;t say this project &#8220;esta bien perro&#8221; but I would say it&#8217;s &#8220;bonito&#8221;. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/43260541\/Perro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Fatlash by Anagrama<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_fatlash.jpg\" alt=\"Fatlash by Anagrama\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/fatlash.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fatlash<\/a> is a London-based service, specializing in semi-permanent eyelash extensions and products. While beauty products tend to go for thin, slender logos, Monterrey, Mexico-based <a href=\"http:\/\/anagrama.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Anagrama<\/a> has gone the opposite route with a chunky, fat wordmark that instead speaks to the volume-izing effect of the eyelashes. I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s a typeface out of the box or if they customized the &#8220;S&#8221; but it&#8217;s a great point of distinction. In application, as usual, the logo placement and sizing along with the restrained color palette by Anagrama makes this project stand out vividly and boldly. <a href=\"http:\/\/anagrama.com\/portafolio\/234-fatlash\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Unplanned and serendipitously &#8212; as I was in Monterrey earlier this week &#8212; today&apos;s projects all come from Mexico, two of them from the northern parts with work by Chihuahua, Guadalajara, and Monterrey&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[930,781],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4942"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4942"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4942\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4942"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4942"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4942"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
