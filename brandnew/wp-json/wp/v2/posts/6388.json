Their new identity, designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/canape.ua\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Canape<\/a>, is a wild concoction of bits and pieces that make reference to the different cuisines (American, Italian, Chinese, and Japanese)&#8230; some in more overt ways like like stars and stripes for America or olives for Italy. Some of the layouts and packages are like Postmodern Hipsterism which, in the hands of Ukrainian designers, is all kinds of awesome. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/62790663\/Roll-Club\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Sydney Design Festival by Re<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_sydneydesignfestival.gif\" alt=\"Sydney Design Festival by Re\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sydneydesign.com.au\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sydney Design Festival<\/a> is, as its name implies, a multi-day design festival in Sydney that &#8220;provides visitors with an opportunity to unpack design in all its forms&#8221; and has been running for 20 years now. This year&#8217;s identity was designed by local firm <a href=\"https:\/\/re.agency\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Re<\/a>, who introduced a great sense of dimension and perspective through an otherwise basic type treatment where each line increases dramatically in size. This basic structure comes to life in the hypnotic animated GIF but also in clever uses of material and space like the pop-up invitation and step painting. The black-green-and-white color palette is bold and striking too, really giving this a hard-to-miss aesthetic. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/re.agency\/sydney-design-festival\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Santa Barba by Esiete<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_santabarba.jpg\" alt=\"Santa Barba by Esiete\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/santabarba.es\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Santa Barba<\/a> (loosely translated as &#8220;Holy Beard&#8221;) produces oils, balms, and soaps specifically for beards. Located in Barcelona, Spain, they take their beards seriously as well as ethically sourcing ingredients and being inclusive in their workplace. The identity, designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/esiete.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Esiete<\/a>, exudes gentle beard-ness, which is not a thing at all but that&#8217;s the feeling I get from the work and presentation: non-douchey manliness. The identity features numerals with abstracted combs built into them because beards. It&#8217;s a weird premise but it works quite well. Overall, the typography is fun and the packaging makes the products look like they will get the job done.<span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/esiete.com\/index.asp?Idioma\/EN\/Seccion\/CLIENTE\/IdCliente\/138\/SANTA-BARBA.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Some bold and slightly eccentric projects this week, with work from Kharkov, Sydney, and Barcelona&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[51,63,11,85,26],"tags":[790,540,564,395,204],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6388"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=6388"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6388\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=6388"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=6388"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=6388"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
