With a long and well documented competition with Heaven, whose existence is also debated by many,  Hell has seen a decline in population and brand recognition. This August &mdash; fittingly the hottest month of the year &mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.helltravel.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the Hell Office of Travel and Tourism<\/a> has introduced a new identity designed by Chicago, IL-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.chrisherrondesign.com\/hell.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Chris Herron Design<\/a> to position Hell as &#8220;the premier global tourist destination.&#8221;<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>&#8220;From the beginning of this project, we understood that our previous marketing efforts portrayed a confusing and misleading image of Hell. But it was only after completing a formal brand review that we grasped the full extent of the problem. Based on stakeholder input, we realized that a complete brand overhauls was necessary,&#8221; says Mr. Landis.<br \/><br \/>With the help of Chris Herron Design, the Hell Office of Travel &amp; Tourism has created a friendly and welcoming voice for destination Hell, and in so doing, has reaffirmed its mission to create an environment in which local businesses can succeed and flourish.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.helltravel.com\/release\/release.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press Release<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hell_logo_old.gif\" alt=\"Hell\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Hell&#8217;s logo evolution.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hell_color_versions.gif\" alt=\"Hell\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The previous logo for Hell communicated exactly what it had to: this place effin&#8217; sucks and you don&#8217;t want to go to there. I don&#8217;t think it was necessary to change the positioning and adopt a look that was the complete opposite: welcoming and friendly. But let&#8217;s assume that it was the right strategic decision. Then the new logo succeeds quite well. The lowercase and rounded sans serif gives it instant accessibility and comfort &mdash; I love the detail on the &#8220;h&#8221; where the stem meets the curve, just a slight notch. The color blue is quite pleasing too. I&#8217;m not sure about the halo, I think people might confuse it for Heaven, but I think once you are there and you see all the spikes and molten lava and other evil stuff then you will quickly know that it is not.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hell_neon.jpg\" alt=\"Hell\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hell_materials.jpg\" alt=\"Hell\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hell_lobby.jpg\" alt=\"Hell\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hell_billboard.jpg\" alt=\"Hell\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The applications keep the identity lively and engaging. I especially love the lobby at corporate headquarters with its stark minimalism. Seeing the logo in white on black shows that it doesn&#8217;t only rely on the shading and the colors to exude friendliness. Overall, this is a great rebrand and even though I would rather not visit anytime soon, at least I can count on a great branded experience if I do end up there one day.<\/p>\n<h1>Note<\/h1>\n<p>Yes, yes, this is not real and no, no, it&#8217;s not April Fools. I know. Chris Herron sent me this project yesterday and I thought it was very smart and clever and he went completely over the top with it. I mean, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.chrisherrondesign.com\/hell.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">just look at all the logo explorations<\/a> he did for a fake project. Some real clients with real projects would be lucky to get that amount of exploration from their consultants. I love when people commit to an idea like this and execute it all the way, it certainly deserves attention. Whenever I give lectures, the inevitable question I get in the end is how does a designer get attention or get his or her foot in the door, either with an employer or potential clients. I always respond that you need to make stuff up, come up with something unique and clever that doesn&#8217;t rely on clients or briefs and that reflects the kind of work you want to do. Make your own. This is the perfect example.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_110817_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_110817_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_110817_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_110817_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_110817_config_03.xml&#038;xyz=poll_110817_votes_03.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv3\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv3\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,64,26],"tags":[292,148,172],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1594"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1594"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1594\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1594"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1594"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1594"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
