Officially unveiled in October 2016, it is currently scheduled for release worldwide in March 2017, 6 years after the launch of the Nintendo 3DS and 5 years after the launch of the Wii U. Nintendo Switch is a hybrid device; the Switch console is a tablet-like portable console, which can be inserted into a docking station connected to a television to use it as a home console. Despite this characteristic, Nintendo still markets the Switch as primarily being a home console rather than a portable. The Switch features two detachable wireless controllers, called Joy-Cons, which can be used individually or attached to a grip to provide a traditional gamepad form.&#8221; (<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nintendo_Switch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wikipedia<\/a>)<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nintendo_switch_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo for Nintendo Switch\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nintendo_switch_console.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Nintendo Switch\" \/>\n<figcaption>Console.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/f5uik5fgIaI\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>First look at the Nintendo Switch.
