To reflect their discerning choices, local designer <a href=\"http:\/\/www.perkybros.com\/portfolio\/woodland-wine-merchant\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jefferson Perky<\/a> chose a red fox as a representation of hunting and gathering. The fox is presented in two ways: first, as the logo with the fox strutting nonchalantly in a more natural representation, and, second, as a close up of its face in a more interpretative representation and set as an amazing pattern. The olive green color with the burst of orange and gray typography looks earthy and delicious. The condensed, rounded sans serif is a great complement to the traditional illustration and vintage-looking pattern. Very foxy all around. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.perkybros.com\/portfolio\/woodland-wine-merchant\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Tamarindo by La Tortilleria<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_tamarindo.jpg\" alt=\"Tamarindo by La Tortilleria\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bartamarindo.es\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tamarindo<\/a> is a restaurant, cafe, bar, and retailer in Ourense, Spain, with a beautifully relaxed identity designed by Monterrey, Mexico-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.latortilleria.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">La Tortilleria<\/a>. The logo is typeset in what looks like a modified version of Orator that has been very generously letter-spaced, giving the spare layouts a sense of modernity. The identity revolves around splitting every canvas in half, from business cards to coasters to bottles of water to coffee cup sleeves. It&#8217;s such a simple idea that, executed with a concise palette of colors and materials, yields a cohesive and endearing set of applications. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.latortilleria.com\/#\/tamarindo-1\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project here<\/strong><\/a><\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Ben Weeks by Tung<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_benweeks.jpg\" alt=\"Ben Weeks by Tung\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">Disclaimer, I guess: I have worked with Toronto-based illustrator <a href=\"http:\/\/benweeks.ca\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ben Weeks<\/a> in the past, he&#8217;s come to our conferences, and we chat whenever we run across each other. However, he has failed to hand me one of these sweet, sweet new business cards of his, designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/madebytung.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tung<\/a>. Perhaps some purists might disagree with me but this is a really great Wolfgang Weingart allusion, whether intentional or not. It&#8217;s spare in its elements but it&#8217;s amazingly dynamic and full of energy and tension. The color palette is also quite fun and adds to the New Wave effect. Ben, you&#8217;ve got my address, put a set of them in the mail for me? <a href=\"http:\/\/madebytung.com\/projects\/ben-weeks-identity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Great selection of colors and typography in this edition of Friday Likes with work from Nashville, Monterrey, and Toronto&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[39,564,1133],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3728"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3728"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3728\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3728"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3728"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3728"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
