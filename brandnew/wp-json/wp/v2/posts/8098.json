The identity, designed &#8212; two years ago, disclaimer &#8212; by Melbourne-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nevernow.com.au\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Never Now<\/a>, is a funky combination of very different typefaces all acting as the logo and then coming together as a motley crew on the pizza box. The typefaces really have no rhyme or reason but unified by the bright green color and deployed with pizza-dough-flinging confidence, the result is oddly satisfying &#8212; with the understanding that there is some typographic irony going on. Bonus points for the happy hand flinging pizza drawing. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nevernow.com.au\/project\/primo\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Huit et demi (Eight and a Half) by Avant Post<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_8andahalf.jpg\" alt=\"Huit et demi (Eight and a Half) by Avant Post\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/huitetdemi.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Huit et demi<\/a> (Eight and a Half) is an architecture firm in Marseille, France, with nine partners (I&#8217;m not sure who the half is). The identity, designed by Paris, France-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.avantpost.fr\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Avant Post<\/a>, is all about the great logo that cleverly slices the &#8220;1&#8221; and the &#8220;2&#8221; in half to create the illusion of a fraction with a slash or line between the smaller integer numbers. It&#8217;s an easy and sophisticated visual puzzle that should delight many. Not much in application, but what&#8217;s there is all in a Swiss style if that kind of thing rocks your boat &#8212; I&#8217;m more into the colored paper choices, which complement the logo quite well. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.avantpost.fr\/en\/projets\/8-et-demi-2\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Jasmin by Hungry Studio<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_jasmin.jpg\" alt=\"Jasmin by Hungry Studio\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.jasmin1.sk\/en\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jasmin<\/a> is a Chinese restaurant in Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia, that has been around since 1996. The identity, designed by local firm <a href=\"https:\/\/hungry.sk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hungry Studio<\/a>, works in tandem with the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vallosadovsky.sk\/wrok\/2018\/9\/26\/jamin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">space&#8217;s redesign<\/a> by Vallo Sadovsky Architects, particularly by picking up on the wood partitions, and turning them into a lovely set of patterns. The logo, which I am not sure if it&#8217;s custom lettering or a font (99% sure it&#8217;s a font), is quite nice as well and looks particularly good debossed on that burlap-y texture of the menu. I&#8217;m not crazy about the supporting typeface, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.myfonts.com\/fonts\/suitcase\/idealista\/?refby=ucllc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Idealista<\/a>, as it feels too &#8220;new&#8221;, but it would be easy to overlook given how nice the space you are dining in is. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/hungry.sk\/Jasmin-restaurant\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"A fairly random collection of things in various styles this week, with work from Melbourne, Paris, and Bratislava&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[58,11,85,26],"tags":[953,762,564],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8098"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=8098"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8098\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=8098"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=8098"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=8098"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
