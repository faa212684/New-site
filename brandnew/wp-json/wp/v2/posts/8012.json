The lozenges feature a letter &#8220;A&#8221; on them, which is for Adolf Ahlgren, a wholesaler in G\u00e4vle, Sweden, who found the product at a German trade fair sold as a cough drop by German pharmacies and marketed it to much success. By 1939, L\u00e4kerol was available in 35 countries and its expansion continues to this day as one of the many brands of Cloetta, a leading confectionery company in the Nordic region and the Netherlands. Recently, L\u00e4kerol introduced a new identity and packaging designed by Stockholm, Sweden-based <a href=\"http:\/\/nordid.se\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NORD ID<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lakerol_vintage.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for L\u00e4kerol by NORD ID\" \/>\n<figcaption>Some historical references of the brand.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>To preserve and revive L\u00e4kerol&#8217;s soul, we&#8217;ve focused on the rich heritage of the brand, without turning it into a retro design.<br \/><br \/>The logotype has been completely reworked, inspired by the rich history of wordmarks the brand have used since 1909. The characters, classic san-serifs with modern angles together with the characteristic arc gives the logo a humble, yet distinguished look.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/nordid.se\/case\/lakerol\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NORD ID project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lakerol_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for L\u00e4kerol by NORD ID\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo looked like a hundred other mainstream consumer products from, like, Procter &amp; Gamble, and could have been anything from ice cream to chocolate to gummy bears, with its weird lettering and poor shadow-highlight streaks. The new logo is a lovely, bold, dignified serif that has been very nicely set on a subtle curve. The &#8220;k&#8221; alone is worth its weight in pastille gold. Granted, this could still be a logo for anything from ice cream to chocolate to gummy bears but it has a more elevated presence and hints at being an older, more mature and sophisticated brand. Also, it says &#8220;Pastilles&#8221; under it so, yeah.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lakerol_identity_elements.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for L\u00e4kerol by NORD ID\" \/>\n<figcaption>Identity elements.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The A-symbol has been simplified and optimized for smaller areas. It&#8217;s placed in a classic L\u00e4kerol way &#8211; in the centre of the front and on top of the lid. A scaled up version of it is also used as a graphic background pattern.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/nordid.se\/case\/lakerol\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NORD ID project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lakerol_a_symbol.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for L\u00e4kerol by NORD ID\" \/>\n<figcaption>&#8220;A&#8221; symbol.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The &#8220;A&#8221; symbol has been on the packaging for a long time and remains mostly unchanged. The counterspace of the &#8220;A&#8221; has been removed to avoid extra noise when the symbol gets smaller. Seeing it on its own, the thickness of the red lines feel a little too bold but on the packaging it has just the right presence.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\" style=\"padding-bottom:67.25%;\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lakerol_type.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Typography.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lakerol_packaging_before_after.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for L\u00e4kerol by NORD ID\" \/>\n<figcaption>Packaging, before and after.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The front has been simplified by removing pastille images and flavor illustrations. Instead it&#8217;s through the three tone color scheme of each pack we communicate the full flavor. This clarification makes it easier for the consumer to find their favorite flavor in the shelf.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/nordid.se\/case\/lakerol\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NORD ID project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lakerol_packaging.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for L\u00e4kerol by NORD ID\" \/>\n<figcaption>Packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The darker color, the darker taste. Each flavor has been arranged according to a flavor system, where licorice based flavors owns the darker tones while the more fruity and sweet flavors owns the lighter color tones. This creates an intuitive way for the consumer to find their taste preference.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/nordid.se\/case\/lakerol\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NORD ID project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lakerol_chart.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for L\u00e4kerol by NORD ID\" \/>\n<figcaption>Chart.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\" style=\"padding-bottom:67.25%;\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lakerol_packaging_colors_01.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<hr \/>\n<div class=\"video-container\" style=\"padding-bottom:67.25%;\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lakerol_packaging_colors_02.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Color palette.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old packaging wasn&#8217;t super appetizing, in part because of the old logo but the heavy gold borders and dull type for the flavor didn&#8217;t help. The new packaging basically maintains the same elements, in the same configuration but it&#8217;s much more refined and balanced. The logo looks good on the brighter-hued lids while the ghosted, blown-up &#8220;A&#8221; symbol in darker hues allows the always-red &#8220;A&#8221; symbol to stand out. I feel that dropping the gold stroke, perhaps in exchange for a black or dark blue foil stamp, could have taken this to the next level but, also, I don&#8217;t mind it as much.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lakerol_packaging_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for L\u00e4kerol by NORD ID\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lakerol_packaging_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for L\u00e4kerol by NORD ID\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lakerol_packaging_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for L\u00e4kerol by NORD ID\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lakerol_packaging_04.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for L\u00e4kerol by NORD ID\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lakerol_packaging_05.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for L\u00e4kerol by NORD ID\" \/>\n<figcaption>Lots of hero shots.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">Overall, this is a tasty, upscale redesign without going overboard and making it feel inaccessible.
