First celebrated in 2006, <a href=\"http:\/\/sfdesignweek.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">San Francisco Design Week<\/a> (SFDW) is organized by the San Francisco chapter of AIGA partnering with the local chapters of the American Institute of Architects (AIA), the Industrial Designers Society of America (IDSA), the Interaction Design Association (IxDA), and the Society for Environmental Graphic Design (SEGD) and it features open studio tours, exhibitions, and talks starting next Monday, June 13. The identity for SFDW has been designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.saltbranding.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SALT Branding<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>The new identity focuses not on the usual San Francisco monuments (let&#8217;s face it, the bridge and cable cars have been done to death), but rather one that, like design, affects San Franciscans every day &mdash; the fog! Design, like the fog, is everywhere &mdash; swirling around us, influencing what we do and what we see.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/saltbranding.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Salt Branding<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sfdw_logo_detail.jpg\" alt=\"San Francisco Design Week\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sfdw_Brochure.jpg\" alt=\"San Francisco Design Week\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sfdw_Posters.jpg\" alt=\"San Francisco Design Week\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sfdw_Web.jpg\" alt=\"San Francisco Design Week\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sfdw_Tshirt.jpg\" alt=\"San Francisco Design Week\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Also like Creative Week New York I really appreciate that there is an effort to look for something unique about the city and translating that into an interesting visual. Creative Week New York was about the city&#8217;s grid and tightness &mdash; SFDW is about the fog. What&#8217;s nice about the concept is that if vendors that do mugs and t-shirts and teddy bears had figured out how to render fog as easily as the Golden Gate Bridge it would already be a terrible clich&eacute; but because fog isn&#8217;t easy to visualize it&#8217;s a great thing to build a design around. The first time I saw the logo I didn&#8217;t realize it was foggy, I just thought it was meant to be groovy looking so I&#8217;m either a little dense sometimes or the logo just needs some explanation here and there. The execution has a late-1990s-Neville-Brody-Blur-typeface look to it (which is not a bad thing altogether) updated to 2011. I also like the 1-color version shown on the t-shirt, perhaps I like it more than the nebula version. Overall, it&#8217;s a fun temporal identity that works well for one year as it would probably get tiring if repeated.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_110609_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_110609_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_110609_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_110609_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,71,26],"tags":[576,46,577],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1494"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1494"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1494\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1494"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1494"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1494"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
