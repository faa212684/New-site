Designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.diferente.info\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Diferente<\/a>, the highlight of this project isn&#8217;t the visual identity but the verbal identity that blends English, Spanish, and Catalan to recreate popular sayings. The best one being &#8220;Come y bebe que the life is breve&#8221; (&#8220;Eat and drink because life is short&#8221;). It&#8217;s not funny ha-ha, especially if Spanish or Catalan (or English) are completely alien to you. The identity itself is fine, if a little disjointed and not just because of the stencil slab, it&#8217;s like it&#8217;s missing an ingredient somewhere that brings it all together, or maybe it just needs more hamburguesa somewhere. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.diferente.info\/work\/tio-joe\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">University of the Arts Helsinki by Bond<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_universityofhelsinki.jpg\" alt=\"University of the Arts Helsinki by Bond\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">Back in 2012 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/x_marks_the_finnish_line.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">we reviewed<\/a> the logo for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.uniarts.fi\/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">University of the Arts Helsinki<\/a> but had no applications to show at the time. As I was prepping yesterday Marko Salonen&#8217;s images for the Brand Nieuwe Conference program I saw all the applications done by <a href=\"http:\/\/bond-agency.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bond<\/a> and thought a Friday Like would be a nice follow-up. I had already like the logos four years ago but the applications are really great. The crooked typography gives everything instant impact, especially as it&#8217;s used large and not shying away from its grotesqueness. In the past review I also questioned the additional &#8220;X&#8221; element but the additional images at the link show how well it&#8217;s used to tie all the different schools together. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/11219015\/University-of-the-Arts-Helsinki\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Mr Big Stuff by Daniel Ting Chong<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_mrbigstuff.jpg\" alt=\"Mr Big Stuff by Daniel Ting Chong\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/mrbigstuff.co.za\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mr Big Stuff<\/a> is a comfort food restaurant in Johannesburg, South Africa, flinging eats like waffles, fried chicken, and burgers, all served with a smile. Literally. Designed by Cape Town-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.danieltingchong.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Daniel Ting Chong<\/a>, Mr Big Stuff is embodied by a contagiously jolly face and chunky wordmark, which have a smart visual relationship between them (shown above). We see on Brand New a lot of logos that are meant to look like faces so it&#8217;s nice to see a logo that&#8217;s an actual face and one that isn&#8217;t creepy or off-putting. The design is simple and charming and the pastel color palette serves it well. The overlaid faces work great as a pattern and those wrapping papers are pretty tasty. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.danieltingchong.com\/mr-big-stuff-burger-joint\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Some minimalist restaurants serve as the buns for a patty of craziness with work from Barcelona, Helsinki, and Cape Town&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[1216,1275,564,35],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4679"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4679"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4679\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4679"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4679"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4679"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
