Based on Microsoft&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Metro_(design_language)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">&#8220;Metro&#8221; design language<\/a>, Windows 8 adopts the user interface currently in play on the Windows Phone OS. By the end of February, Microsoft will release a consumer preview (don&#8217;t call it Beta) of Windows 8 and its new logo was recently spotted. <strong><span class=\"red\">Update:<\/span> This post has been revised with design credit to Pentagram partner Paula Scher and text from Sam Moreau, Principal Director of User Experience for Windows; scroll to the bottom.<\/strong><\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/windows_8_logo_detail_wrong.gif\" alt=\"Windows 8\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/windows_8_metro.gif\" alt=\"Windows 8\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Principles of Microsoft&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Metro_(design_language)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">&#8220;Metro&#8221; design language<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"574\" height=\"292\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/p92QfWOw88I\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Official video from Microsoft introducing the new user interface of Windows 8.

The Metro approach relies on the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Segoe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Segoe font family<\/a>, originally designed by Steve Matteson for Agfa Monotype and later licensed by Microsoft, which has been deployed on most Microsoft materials in the last four or five years. It&#8217;s a fine font, but pretty it is not. It&#8217;s a kind of middle-of-the-road sans serif without any memorable attributes and with a very peculiar &#8220;Default&#8221; aesthetic to it. It works best as a user interface ingredient but as the typography on a logo, it&#8217;s extremely underwhelming &mdash; pair it with the worst rendition yet of the Windows window and you have a real loser. I&#8217;m not saying the previous Windows icons were good, but they had enough abstraction (and gradients and shadows and highlights) to at least look techie and Microsoft-ey, but this &#8220;minimal&#8221; approach looks like, well, a window. A window in a $400-a-month studio apartment rental with beige carpeting and plastic drapes. Moving away from the more flag-like icon seems like abandoning two decades of equity &mdash; crappy equity, but equity nonetheless.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"red\">Update 02\/17\/12 @9:53 am:<\/span> Just got a note from a very unexpected source (on the design side) that this is indeed the wrong release logo and that the proper one should be launched next week. Stay tuned.<\/strong>\n<p><strong><span class=\"red\">Update 02\/17\/12 @11:47 am:<\/span> The Windows Team has just <a href=\"http:\/\/windowsteamblog.com\/windows\/b\/bloggingwindows\/archive\/2012\/02\/17\/redesigning-the-windows-logo.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">published a post on their blog<\/a> with details on the new logo, designed by Pentagram partner Paula Scher.<\/strong>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/windows_8_logo_right.png\" alt=\"Windows Logo, Before and After\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/windows_8_logo_detail_right.png\" alt=\"Windows 8\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/windows_8_logo_comparison.png\" alt=\"Windows 8\" \/><\/p>\n<blockquote>1. We wanted the new logo to be both modern and classic by echoing the International Typographic Style (or Swiss design) that has been a great influence on our Metro style design philosophy. Using bold flat colors and clean lines and shapes, the new logo has the characteristics of way-finding design systems seen in airports and subways.<br \/><br \/>2. It was important that the new logo carries our Metro principle of being &#8220;Authentically Digital&#8221;. By that, we mean it does not try to emulate faux-industrial design characteristics such as materiality (glass, wood, plastic, etc.). It has motion &mdash; aligning with the fast and fluid style you&#8217;ll find throughout Windows 8.<br \/><br \/>3. Our final goal was for the new logo to be humble, yet confident. Welcoming you in with a slight tilt in perspective and when you change your color, the logo changes to reflect you. It is a &#8220;Personal&#8221; Computer after all.<br \/>&mdash; Sam Moreau, Principal Director of User Experience for Windows<\/blockquote>\n<p>My opinion now that this has come to light?
