Having never stayed in an <a href=\"http:\/\/www.econolodge.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Econo Lodge<\/a> hotel and, from looking at a few photos, being convinced that I would not want to do so in the future for fear of being maimed by a freak with a mask coming out of the hallway as I put a dollar bill in a vending machine, I decided to not follow up on it. But as promised in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hotelmotel.com\/hotelmotel\/article\/articleDetail.jsp?id=427175\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the press release<\/a>, &#8220;this summer, travelers can anticipate to begin to see the updated logo on exterior signage on new Econo Lodge hotels,&#8221; more people have sent in e-mails about it, so I&#8217;m finally putting it up. Another reason of why I may not have been eager to post it is because there is probably not much to say: Mediocre-but-satisfactory hotel chain has a mediocre-but-quirky wordmark replaced for a mediocre-period shiny swoosh that shimmers &mdash; oh, and it has <a href=\"http:\/\/mfile.akamai.com\/15771\/mov\/choicehote1.download.akamai.com\/15771\/commercials\/princess-frog.mov\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a clever TV ad involving a princess, a frog and a logo<\/a>. I have to admit though, the swooshy &#8220;e&#8221; could have gone somewhere in the right hands, but definitely can not say the same for the condensed typeface that looks like the bastard child of Rotis Sans and Optima.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,73,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/678"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=678"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/678\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=678"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=678"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=678"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
