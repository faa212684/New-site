Each drink features its own delightful geometric-shape abstraction on the front and while one could ask for a bigger sense of conceptual purpose or reasoning from these, they are simply too visually pleasing to be concerned about such things. The bottles themselves are quite great too, with an extra chunky body and a thick embossed wordmark on the side. The wordmark itself is pretty cool too, with some odd, harsh angles that go very well with the silhouette of the bottle. I wonder if the inclusion of these in Friday Likes and my praise  for them will qualify me as a &#8220;friends and family&#8221; of Studio MPLS&#8230; wink wink.<span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/studiompls.com\/project\/vildmark\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\r\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Arielle Shoshana by Wade and Leta<\/h1>\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_arielleshoshana.jpg\" alt=\"Arielle Shoshana by Wade and Leta\" \/>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.arielleshoshana.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Arielle Shoshana<\/a> is a fragrance boutique with a brick-and-mortar store in Fairfax, VA, and a robust online store that curates the &#8220;best in hard-to-find, independent fragrances, home and body products, and other scented luxuries&#8221;. Now they also offer their very own fragrances: Saturday and Sunday. The packaging, designed by Brooklyn, NY-based <a href=\"https:\/\/wadeandleta.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wade and Leta<\/a>, features a dramatic, injection-molded cap of two giant overlapping circles in bouncy, happy colors that tower over the glass container.  The contrast of the proportions between the pieces of the package is super fun and, especially with the Saturday scent, the color combo makes it even more playful. It&#8217;s like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=Effie+Trinket&#038;safe=active&#038;sxsrf=ALeKk01VkU1QKSNSqcM47FAoOxGq1PxYPg:1596187702364&#038;source=lnms&#038;tbm=isch&#038;sa=X&#038;ved=2ahUKEwidzPnHlvfqAhVKHM0KHdk7AsEQ_AUoAXoECBwQAw&#038;biw=1309&#038;bih=792\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Effie Trinket<\/a> in bottle form. That&#8217;s a compliment. The bold statement of the cap is offset by very nice and simple sans serif typography on the bottle and an unassuming box that only begins to hint at the party that&#8217;s waiting inside. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/wadeandleta.com\/work\/arielle-shoshana-2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\r\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Vusa by Boldly<\/h1>\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_vusa.jpg\" alt=\"Vusa by Boldly\" \/>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.vusavodka.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Vusa<\/a> (which means &#8220;awaken&#8221; in Zulu) is a premium copper-distilled Vodka from South Africa. Unlike other grain-based vodkas, it&#8217;s distilled from sugar cane and filtered through the Baobab tree using water from the Lions River in the KwaZulu-Natal province. The identity, designed by London, UK-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.boldly.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Boldly<\/a>, takes cues from Zulu art and twenty-first-century Africa&#8217;s underground music, street art, food, and fashion to concoct a striking bottle with a bold diamond-shaped label that helps contain a great stencil wordmark and a lovely tone-on-tone pattern. An inner pattern that can be seen through the liquid and the slits around the diamond label adds to the vibrancy of the bottle as does the seal that runs from the top of the cap to the neck of the bottle. I&#8217;m not a big vodka fan but I feel vusa&#8217;d to try this one. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.boldly.co.uk\/case-studies\/vusa\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"A trio of exuberant bottles of different shapes, sizes, and flavors (and scents) this week, with work from Minneapolis, Brooklyn, and London&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[51,11,26],"tags":[53,1328,427,929,951],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/9001"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=9001"}],"version-history":[{"count":5,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/9001\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":9189,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/9001\/revisions\/9189"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=9001"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=9001"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=9001"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
