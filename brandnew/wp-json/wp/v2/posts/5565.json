B&amp;O Play addresses the latter, with a line of portable products &#8212; headphones and wireless speakers &#8212; for the design- and semi-budget-conscious consumer. The product line has proved quite the success for Bang &amp; Olufsen as it has given it a competing product against the similarly priced Beats while offering a more grown-up look. Recently B&amp;O Play introduced new packaging designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pearlfisher.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pearlfisher<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>We wanted to help the consumer feel the music before pressing play: to go from looking at silence on a shelf of products to truly seeing the sound. Drawing from the rich, tactile world of print magazines &#8211; one of inspiring stories of place, space, emotion and mood &#8211; we looked to capture the anticipation of beautiful music with a narrative approach to design.<br \/><br \/>Changing periodically in a way evocative of a revolving annual, the new packaging gives the brand scope to reflect contemporary culture in a way that aligns with the lifestyles of its target market: nomadic, moment-led and experience-driven.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.pearlfisher.com\/work\/beoplay\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pearlfisher project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/b_and_o_play_old_look.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for B&amp;O Play by Pearlfisher\" \/>\n<figcaption>Previous packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/b_and_o_play_competition.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for B&amp;O Play by Pearlfisher\" \/>\n<figcaption>The competition. They all show the silhouetted product against color background and minimal layouts (except for Bose, which is whack); just like the old B&amp;O Play packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old packaging was super nice &#8212; you can see more of it <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thedieline.com\/blog\/2014\/6\/22\/bo-play-headphones\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a> &#8212; with great product photography, crisp typography, and a lovely color palette. They could have easily kept this packaging for years and it would have served them well but I like how they recognized that they were doing the exact same thing as the competition, just in a different flavor. Switching away from what is basically general retail standards and expectations is not easy but the new direction certainly makes the transition easier on the eyes.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/b_and_o_play_packaging_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for B&amp;O Play by Pearlfisher\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/b_and_o_play_packaging_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for B&amp;O Play by Pearlfisher\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/b_and_o_play_packaging_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for B&amp;O Play by Pearlfisher\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/b_and_o_play_packaging_05.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for B&amp;O Play by Pearlfisher\" \/>\n<figcaption>New packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">The new packaging is super nice as well but in a different, less expected way&#8230; The typography all around is quite nice and I especially like the backs of the boxes that look almost like a 1990s annual report. The new approach features editorial-style product photography that still showcases the actual product but also transports the consumer to the idyllic scenario where the products are used and creates a slightly more emotional bond, triggering associations to a sweet day at the beach, a lazy Sunday, or just to something more exciting and aspirational than what we are all doing right at this moment &#8212; unless reading Brand New is the most idyllic thing you do, then I hug you.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 2012, B&amp;O Play is a subsidiary of Bang &amp; Olufsen, the Danish audio equipment company, known as much for its sleek design and sound craftsmanship as for its bank-account-breaking prices.
