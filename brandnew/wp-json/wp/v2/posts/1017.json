Originally, each initiative had its own logo, lacking any consistency with the others. Because of that, there was no indication that it was part of a greater entity. Another problem was the absence of an umbrella logo for the Pew Center. The challenge for London-based <a href=\"http:\/\/johnsonbanks.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">johnson banks<\/a> was to solve a rather specific client brief.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>Although they wanted at one level to present themselves as a unified &#8220;Pew Center,&#8221; they still wanted to show that they worked across dance, exhibitions, arts fellowships, theatre, management, heritage and music, all within the Philadelphia area.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/johnsonbanks.co.uk\/thoughtfortheweek\/index.php?thoughtid=532\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">johnsonbanks case study<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pew_variations.gif\" alt=\"Pew Center for Arts &amp; Heritage\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Glancing at the Pew Center&#8217;s web site &mdash; as its civilian audience will experience it, and not presented in a case study &mdash; you might think the logo to be the white square, and that the other words and colors were designed purely for the website&#8217;s navigation. <a href=\"http:\/\/johnsonbanks.co.uk\/thoughtfortheweek\/index.php?thoughtid=532\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Checking johnsonbanks&#8217; project description proves otherwise<\/a>. This megalith of a logo includes the organization&#8217;s full name, the seven initiatives, the word &#8220;Philadelphia&#8221;, and a mammoth palette of eight colors. Designed to adapt to different situations, the primary logo system has three forms, each with varying scale and detail. The largest holds a record-breaking 25 words. <\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pew_initiatives.gif\" alt=\"Pew Center for Arts &amp; Heritage\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Deeper in the system are treatments designed to push individual initiatives. Each maintains the typeface, 8-color standard, the word &#8220;Philadelphia&#8221;, and a tiny &#8220;The Pew Center for Arts &amp; Heritage.&#8221; It&#8217;s unclear whether these are meant to be the official logos for the initiative. If so, they certainly won&#8217;t work at small sizes. Other than that, the designs show just how recognizeable and flexible the &#8220;colored cards&#8221; concept can be.<\/p>\n<p><object width=\"574\" height=\"322\"><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" \/><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" \/><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=8649717&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1\" \/><embed src=\"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=8649717&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1\" type=\"application\/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" width=\"574\" height=\"322\"><\/embed><\/object><\/p>\n<p>A minimal sans-in-square logo isn&#8217;t particularly groundbreaking for an art institution. What makes these logos worth noting is the ironic use of that solution &mdash; where the bombardment of simplicity creates a clutter that&#8217;s hard to miss. Aesthetically, it isn&#8217;t the most beautiful, nor the most interesting thing. A family of icons representing the initiatives would&#8217;ve been simpler to manage than type. Accusations of bad design decisions about scalability and printability are certainly expected and valid. In the end, though, it&#8217;s those risky decisions that make the logo stand out. Most importantly, the design tends to the client&#8217;s need of a flexible system that reflects the relationship of an organization and its constituents.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pew_sign.jpg\" alt=\"Pew Center for Arts &amp; Heritage\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pew_other.jpg\" alt=\"Pew Center for Arts &amp; Heritage\" \/><\/p>\n<div class=\"bottom\">Kosal Sen is the founder of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.philatype.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Philatype<\/a>, and an art director at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sidesmedia.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sides Media<\/a> where he spends most of his time on interactive design.
