(Sorry for the delay on this one!). I believe the golden thingies in the old logo were super streamlined eagles, and they were in need of a major overhaul that they handsomely received from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lippincott.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lippincott<\/a>. This is a really great update, the new icon is elegant and dynamic with an inherent motion that most airline logos strive for but rarely achieve even when they &#8220;italicize&#8221; every element of the identity. The wordmark is also rather nice, and it evolves the extended serif from the previous logo with a custom sans serif that complements the icon very well. The one thing I don&#8217;t get is the purple &#8220;crest&#8221; at the top of the eagle&#8217;s head, it seems a little unnecessary to add that third color. And the one thing that did disappoint was the livery, it just seems like the identity would have lent itself to a much more engaging and attractive design on the airplane. Nonetheless, one of my favorite icons of the year.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/taca_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"TACA Airlines Logo, Detail\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/taca_livery.jpg\" alt=\"TACA Airlines Livery\" \/><\/p>\n<p><object width=\"425\" height=\"344\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/eW1qSqIYBFE&#038;hl=en&#038;fs=1\"><\/param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"><\/param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"><\/param><embed src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/eW1qSqIYBFE&#038;hl=en&#038;fs=1\" type=\"application\/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\"><\/embed><\/object><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Televison ad from South America, worth putting up with the images of the impossibly pretty people to see the animated logo at the end.
