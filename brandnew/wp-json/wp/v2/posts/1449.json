TechCrunch <a href=\"http:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2011\/03\/03\/new-yfrog\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reports<\/a> that, according to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.quantcast.com\/yfrog.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Quantcast<\/a>, yfrog has 500,000 uploads every day and almost 20 million unique visits a month. That&#8217;s, like, a lot. Although not, like, enough to beat its main competition, TwitPic, which gathers about 30 million uniques a month and seems to be the most recurring spot to be directed to to see images from Twitter. In a complete rethinking of the service yfrog has transformed into a full-fledged social platform with user profiles, celebrity yfroggers, the ability to comment directly on photos, and other accoutrements of sharing and liking. Along with the new website, comes a new logo.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/yfrog_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"yfrog Logo, Before and After\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The old logo featured ImageShack&#8217;s own yellow frog from its logo, along with a rather bizarre wordmark that couldn&#8217;t make up its mind of whether it&#8217;s a stencil or not. The logo looked amateur and not very trustworthy. The new logo is certainly more professional but it&#8217;s as dull as watching a frog croak. Speaking of frogs: where is the frog in the logo? I don&#8217;t mean to be dense and say that a logo has to literally reflect the name of the product, company, or service it represents but when the name includes the word &#8220;frog&#8221; it seems to me like there are dozens of visual ideas that could be exploited. Instead we have a circle of speech bubbles that represent, you better believe it, online dialog and sharing! Exciting, isn&#8217;t it? But let&#8217;s assume that that&#8217;s the best concept ever, then why are the speech bubbles ever-so-slightly skewed and scaled as they progress? It&#8217;s barely noticeable when small and it&#8217;s utterly annoying when big. The best part of the logo is the typography, even if there isn&#8217;t a frog there either.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to Chris Maury for first tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_110503_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_110503_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_110503_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_110503_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,26,88],"tags":[42,282,549],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1449"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1449"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1449\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1449"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1449"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1449"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
