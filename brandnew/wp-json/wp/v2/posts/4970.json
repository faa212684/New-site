Designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.estudiomenta.mx\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Menta<\/a>, the identity is a great manifestation of both cultures with a classy, bold serif wordmark in copper foil stamp paired with an eclectic quilt of single-black-color, folk-ish patterns. It&#8217;s a winning combination with plenty of flexibility, allowing the pattern to adapt to anything from macaron boxes to aprons. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/43762309\/Manass\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Mr.Frank by Ricardo Leite<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_mrfrank.jpg\" alt=\"Mr.Frank by Ricardo Leite\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/hellomrfrank.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mr.Frank<\/a> is a boutique video and film production company in Amsterdam making commercials and branded content or, in their words, making &#8220;quality films that cut through the clutter like a lightsaber through butter&#8221;. The logo and identity by local designer <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ricardoleite.net\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ricardo Leite<\/a> matches the hip, deadpan vibe of Mr.Frank&#8217;s work with a no-frills sans serif wordmark that benefits from the name itself where the two words establish a cool Mr.\/Fr. combo that makes no sense in terms of writing or abbreviation rules but captures the off-beat approach of the work. For some reason there is two different Mr.Frank logos &#8212; one in title case in one sans and another in uppercase in another sans &#8212; which I don&#8217;t endorse but, hey, leave it to the Dutch to pull off something like that convincingly. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/43324499\/MrFrank\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Toro by Futura<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_toro.jpg\" alt=\"Toro by Futura\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/bkk.toro-restaurant.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Toro<\/a> is a renown tapas restaurant with outposts in New York and Boston as well as in Bangkok where this identity by Mexico City-based <a href=\"http:\/\/byfutura.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Futura<\/a> is taking bulls by the horns, so to speak. The main element of the project is a charming illustration that evokes <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pablopicasso.org\/images\/paintings\/guernica3.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Picasso&#8217;s &#8220;Guernica&#8221;<\/a> in style while also honoring the Toro (Bull) name by having a figure running for his life as he&#8217;s chased in the Running of the Bulls. The tight crop on the illustration yields an almost abstract geometric pattern and anchors all the neatly laid out geometric sans serif in stark black and white. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/42757079\/Toro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"The black-and-white is strong this week with work from Guadalajara, Amsterdam, and Mexico City&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[1065,638,564],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4970"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4970"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4970\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4970"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4970"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4970"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
