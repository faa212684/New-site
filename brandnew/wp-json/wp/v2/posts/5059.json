Part 5 of the series, with the Worst Noted, is a different story, there is a ton of really bad things in that list! So the inclusions in this list are judged on a curve, I guess, in relationship and in contrast to the Best and some of these projects were, indeed, worse than those other ones so someone had to make the cut and these nine are it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>See also:<\/strong><br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_best_and_worst_identities_of_2016_part_1_the_most_notable_reviewed.php\">Part 1: The Most Notable Reviewed<\/a><br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_best_and_worst_identities_of_2016_part_2_the_best_reviewed.php\">Part 2: The Best Reviewed<\/a><br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_best_and_worst_identities_of_2016_part_4_the_best_noted.php\">Part 4: The Best Noted<\/a><br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_best_and_worst_identities_of_2016_part_5_the_worst_noted.php\">Part 5: The Worst Noted<\/a><br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_best_and_worst_identities_of_2016_part_6_the_best_friday_likes.php\">Part 6: The Best Friday Likes<\/a><\/p><!--more--><style media=\"screen\" type=\"text\/css\">\n.best_of {border:1px solid #cccccc;padding:25px 25px 0;margin-bottom:60px;-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;-moz-font-smoothing: antialiased;-o-font-smoothing: antialiased;-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;-moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;}\n\t.best_of hr {margin:20px 0 12px;}\n\t.best_of img {margin-bottom:-3px;}\n\t.fix_margin_image {margin-bottom:-3px!important;}\n\t.best_of .light {font-weight: 400;}\n.best_of .table_with_logo {width:100%;margin-bottom:15px;}\n\t.best_of .table_with_logo_col_01 {width:33.333333%;background:#f50a0a;}\n\t\t.best_of .table_with_logo_col_01 .original_post, .best_of .table_with_logo_col_01_gray .original_post {margin-top:30px;letter-spacing:.1em;color:#333}\n\t.best_of .table_with_logo_col_01_gray {width:33.333333%;background:#e5e5e5}\n\t.best_of .table_with_logo_col_01_padding {padding:25px;}\n\t.best_of .table_with_logo_col_02 {width:66.666666%;}\n.best_of .table_with_poll, .best_of .table_with_poll_white {width:100%;border-top:1px solid #999999;background:#d6d6d6;}\n\t.best_of p  a.gray { color:#f50a0a!important; text-decoration: none; padding-bottom:1px; border-bottom:1px solid #f50a0a; }\n\t.best_of p  a.gray:visited { color:#f50a0a!important; text-decoration: none; padding-bottom:1px; border-bottom:1px solid #f50a0a; }\n\t.best_of p  a.gray:hover { color: #333333!important; text-decoration: none; padding-bottom:1px; border-bottom:1px solid #333333; }\n<\/style>\n<!-- X X X  NO. 9 X X X  -->\n<div class=\"best_of\">\n    <table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" class=\"table_with_logo\">\n      <tr>\n        <td class=\"table_with_logo_col_01_gray\" valign=\"top\">\n            <!-- TITLE -->\n            <div class=\"table_with_logo_col_01_padding\">\n            <h1 class=\"gray rb_1_g50 rb_mar_small rb_pad_small\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Best_and_Worst_Brand_New_2016_Numerals_09.png\" alt=\"9\" \/><br \/>\n            <!-- X X X  CLIENT NAME X X X  -->\n            Listasafn Reykjav\u00edkur (Reykjavik Art Museum)\n            <\/h1>\n            <!-- X X X  DESIGNER NAME X X X  -->\n            <h2 class=\"gray_100\">Designed by karlssonwilker inc<\/h2>\n            <!-- X X X  ORIGINAL POST URL X X X  -->\n            <p class=\"individual_resize_p original_post\"><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/new_logo_and_identity_for_listasafn_reykjavikur_reykjavik_art_museum_by_karlssonwilker_inc.php\" class=\"gray\">SEE ORIGINAL POST<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n            <\/div>\n        <\/td>\n        <td class=\"table_with_logo_col_02\">\n            <!-- LOGO IMAGE --><a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/new_logo_and_identity_for_listasafn_reykjavikur_reykjavik_art_museum_by_karlssonwilker_inc.php\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Best_and_Worst_Brand_New_2016_Part2_Reviewed_Best_13.png\" alt=\"The Best and Worst Identities of 2016, Part 2: The Best Reviewed\" class=\"fix_margin_image\" \/><br \/><!-- SUPPORTING IMAGES --><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Best_and_Worst_Brand_New_2016_Part2_Reviewed_Best_13_extra.jpg\" alt=\"The Best and Worst Identities of 2016, Part 2: The Best Reviewed\" \/><\/a>\n        <\/td>\n      <\/tr>\n    <\/table>\n    <!-- X X X  OPINION  X X X -->\n    <p>Yup, I also included this one in the Best Of list and it&#8217;s not that I can&#8217;t make up my mind but just as there are things to celebrate about it there are things to cringe about it, primary being the if-you-don&#8217;t-get-it-you-suck attitude from the too-cool-to-try-harder aesthetic.

On the surface there is nothing visibly wrong with it but since this is a blog for designers I have no trouble in mourning the evolution of the original Saul Bass logo into what it has become. It&#8217;s not for pure nostalgia sake or because I blindly defend anything done by the masters; it&#8217;s about the almost nonsensical evolution of a flat logo that implied dimension followed by a dimensional logo with a graphic that implies dimension followed by the most recent version that removes the shading and transparency &#8212; a good thing, I guess &#8212; and reverses the color bands from white to blue and yields a wobbly mess of curves.

Unfortunately, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/2016\/02\/the-inside-story-behind-ubers-colorful-redesign\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">what read on paper like a series of unfortunate design process events<\/a> yielded one of the least useful or meaningful updates for &#8212; love them or hate them &#8212; one of the most significant companies in the world. Other than being bolder, the new wordmark is generic and the execution lackluster. The app icon abandoned the &#8220;U&#8221; &#8212; where they literally owned that letter in the same way Facebook owned the &#8220;f&#8221; in app icons &#8212; in favor of a &#8220;bit&#8221;. And they built an identity around a confusing concept of &#8220;atoms&#8221; that are mostly patterns, I think.
