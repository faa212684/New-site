(For a more in-depth explanation see this <a href=\"http:\/\/familybuildingsociety.co.uk\/About-us-home\/MediaCentre\/The-Family-Mortgage-Video.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">video<\/a>). It also offers saving and insurance plans. The Family Building Society launched with an identity designed by London-based <a href=\"http:\/\/johnsonbanks.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">johnson banks<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_family_building_society_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for The Family Building Society by johnson banks\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The logo on its own is nice and really well done, typeset in Hoefler &amp; Co.&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.typography.com\/fonts\/verlag\/overview\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Verlag<\/a>, with an Art Deco-ish vibe, enhanced all the more by the mint color &mdash; you could totally see this on the facade of a Miami Art Deco building. Not sure if that&#8217;s a good thing for a financial institution but it certainly gives it a welcoming attitude that doesn&#8217;t feel like a cold-blooded bank. Like with most johnson banks projects, the real hat trick is in the application.<\/p>\n<blockquote>The chosen solution allows the building society to customise its own logo to each of its customers by overprinting their customer names, so what was a generic &#8216;offer&#8217; becomes specific to each particular family, even down to their own version of the logo.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/johnsonbanks.co.uk\/thoughtfortheweek\/the-family-building-society\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">johnson banks project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_family_building_society_logo_family_variations.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for The Family Building Society by johnson banks\" \/>\n<figcaption>Family variations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>This is a very unusual idea, and gathered much debate at the concept stage. After testing on certain key elements (offer letters, direct mail, etc) it became clear that the idea could actually be delivered. Simply by amending the &#8216;field&#8217; in the letterhead file, we can overprint customers&#8217; names over the logo in letters, for example.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/johnsonbanks.co.uk\/thoughtfortheweek\/the-family-building-society\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">johnson banks project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_family_building_society_letterhead.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for The Family Building Society by johnson banks\" \/>\n<figcaption>Letterhead.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>By using the top rule in the logo as a signature line, the logo can be customized to each family the bank prepares an offer for at first, and then in all communications after. It requires some effort from the staff but a good set of Word Doc templates should do all the magic and someone on the inside has to have enough handwriting styles to churn out multiple names as I doubt potential clients will bother to provide their last name handwritten. Or each rep is most likely doing their own. In any case, what might seem like a really hard customization for each client has been made tenable for The Family Building Society.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_family_building_society_brochures.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for The Family Building Society by johnson banks\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brochures.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_family_building_society_ads.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for The Family Building Society by johnson banks\" \/>\n<figcaption>Ads.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">The rest of the identity uses some heartwarming black and white photography and more of the handwritten lettering to highlight what each person is saving for. Simple and clean, with the logo placed fairly large and noticeable on the corners, sometimes with and sometimes without a family name. Overall, this is a great concept that enhances the otherwise minimal logo and allows the organization to make a simple yet significant connection with its customers.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in mid-2014, The Family Building Society is a building society &mdash; a term in the UK that refers to financial institutions owned by their members and offering banking and related financial services, like mortgage lending &mdash; that is specifically&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[37,12,26],"tags":[179,296,987,228,1160],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3944"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3944"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3944\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3944"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3944"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3944"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
