I think it&#8217;s the nostalgia for nostalgia that keeps us (or at least me) intrigued. Last month, I <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/new_logo_for_tv_land.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Noted the logo change<\/a> but there was nothing else to see, particularly no on-air look montage set to catchy music, which leads us to today&#8217;s follow-up: Los Angeles, CA-based <a href=\"http:\/\/roger.tv\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Roger<\/a> recently posted a project page with their work for TV Land.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>This isn&#8217;t your parent&#8217;s TVLAND anymore. Roger was enlisted to reimagine their entire brand look, from the logo mark to the way they shoot photography. This major brand overhaul coincides with the release of an awesome suite of scripted originals, including the shows Younger, The Jim Gaffigan Show, Impastor and Teachers.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/roger.tv\/design-animation\/tvland-2015-rebrand\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Roger project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tv_land_2015_followup_logo_colors.png\" alt=\"Follow-up: On-air Look for TV Land by Roger\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo colors.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tv_land_2015_followup_stationery.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: On-air Look for TV Land by Roger\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stationery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>There is no need to go into the logo again. My original reaction remains about the same: it&#8217;s cool to look at because uppercase, sans serif, italic typography set at an angle is always cool to look at (try it!) but it could be for any other channel whatsoever. Seeing it in more colors or stationery doesn&#8217;t move me to like it or dislike it any more or less.

The hand-drawn, brush lettering is cool because it usually is but we&#8217;ve also seen that trope before in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/new_logo_and_on-air_look_for_fyi_by_loyalkaspar.php#.VboAymRVhBc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FYI<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/style_finally_looks_stylish.php#.Vbn_oWRVhBc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Style<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/follow-up_travel_channel.php#.Vbn_k2RVhBc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Travel Channel<\/a>; this is not to imply copycat-ism, but it&#8217;s not novel. The editor marks work as a highlighting device but I&#8217;m definitely left wondering what they have to do not just with TV Land but with TV in general. The torn paper seems like such an old trick but maybe it&#8217;s cool because it&#8217;s uncool?<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/131905877?color=ffffff&#038;title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>On-air look.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">While the ingredients are not groundbreaking they benefit from some good motion work, getting pieced together with the frenetic energy needed to get anyone&#8217;s attention these days. Papers rip quickly, editor marks scratch on and off the screen, and hand-drawn type flashes in your face. I&#8217;ll be the first to admit that I like this because when it comes to on-air montages I&#8217;m like a cat whose owner is shaking a bag of kibble, I&#8217;ll come running and want to get it no matter what it is. My favorite moments are when the logo gets animated extending from short to long at the 0:50 mark and the very last closing bit of animation. The problem here is that I still fail to see any relationship with the channel. This could be for anything, even ESPN. As committed as Roger was in executing this by bringing in realistic elements I doubt this will have much longevity mostly in part due to the seeming lack of direction that TV Land has.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"This is the fourth post on TV Land &mdash; 2012 (a), 2012 (b), and 2015 &mdash; and that&#8217;s perhaps more than is needed but I&#8217;m proud of my due diligence on a TV channel few of us watch.
