Building on that project, Covington, KY-based <a href=\"http:\/\/bldgrefuge.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BLDG<\/a> has evolved the Big Lex into a formal identity that will anchor the name change of the Lexington Convention and Visitors Bureau to VisitLEX.<\/p><!--more--><figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/visit_lex_painting.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Lexington, KY by BLDG\" \/>\n<figcaption>The Edward Troye painting that drives the work.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/visit_lex_process.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Lexington, KY by BLDG\" \/>\n<figcaption>The starting point.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>We developed a new identity with the desire to create a cohesive look and feel that would make the brand instantly recognizable and bring the experience to life.

Rather, it comes with a pre-existing big idea &mdash; Big Lex from Pentagram &mdash; two or three years of somewhat inconsistent use of it, with the additional identity of the Convention and Visitors Bureau also in play. I recommend taking a look at <a href=\"http:\/\/bldgrefuge.com\/project\/visitlex\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BLDG&#8217;s case study<\/a>, as it helps paint the picture. Big Lex now comes in two flavors, painterly and flat, which gives the identity a good range of flexibility for multiple uses. As a logo, it&#8217;s not your typical city logo but it sure is memorable. Paired with a very unassuming sans serif, Big Lex does all the heavy lifting.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/visit_lex_stationery.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Lexington, KY by BLDG\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stationery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/visit_lex_other_id_materials.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Lexington, KY by BLDG\" \/>\n<figcaption>Other identity materials.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/visit_lex_print_stuff.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Lexington, KY by BLDG\" \/>\n<figcaption>Print material samples.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/visit_lex_totes.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Lexington, KY by BLDG\" \/>\n<figcaption>Tote bags.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/visit_lex_iphone_cases.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Lexington, KY by BLDG\" \/>\n<figcaption>iPhone cases.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/visit_lex_poster.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Lexington, KY by BLDG\" \/>\n<figcaption>Poster.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/visit_lex_ad.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Lexington, KY by BLDG\" \/>\n<figcaption>Prototype print ad.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">In application, a lovely serif has been added that gives all the applications a bourbon-esque air of sophistication that clashes (positively) with the deadpan expression of the big-ass, blue horse. Some tweedy patterns have been developed that also add a welcome flavor to the identity. And a moody use of photography paints the city as a place you want to be. Overall, a very tasteful and modestly playful identity.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Best known as the Horse Capital of the World, Lexington, Kentucky is a booming city with a small population of less than half a million, a stable economy, a high degree of education, technology companies within, bourbon, the 28,000-plus-student University&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,64,26],"tags":[975,292,966,33],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2893"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2893"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2893\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2893"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2893"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2893"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
