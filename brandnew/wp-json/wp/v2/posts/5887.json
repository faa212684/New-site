Online, the effect was easy to implement because we could animate it and it would instantly convey the distortion but in print it was a little more complicated or, at least, it wasn&#8217;t as vivid so we made sure to use some of the wilder (yet still readable) distortions for print applications.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Tote bags<\/h1>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/BN_Conf_2017_Identity_Summary_Bags_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2017 Brand New Conference by UnderConsideration\" \/>\n<figcaption>Tote bags.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>This year, we started the identity process with the bags because from the start we knew two key things: we wanted a reflective material and we wanted the design to bleed off the edges. This is not possible with traditional tote bags, as you can&#8217;t bleed anything and material options are limited, so we knew a third key thing, which was that the bags needed to be outsourced to China and the lead time for that is 6 or 7 months. The bag factory was able to source and amazing fabric that was reflective and had a super nice thick body to it. They were also able to silkscreen on it, going beyond the edges, and then sewing the bags together. We selected four distorted type treatments and unified them with a layout that later became the basic approach to all applications (lots of <a href=\"https:\/\/commercialtype.com\/catalog\/styrene\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Styrene<\/a> from Commercial Type, thin rules, and the star pattern derived from the Chicago flag).<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/BN_Conf_2017_Identity_Summary_Bags_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2017 Brand New Conference by UnderConsideration\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/BN_Conf_2017_Identity_Summary_Bags_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2017 Brand New Conference by UnderConsideration\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/BN_Conf_2017_Identity_Summary_Bags_04.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2017 Brand New Conference by UnderConsideration\" \/>\n<figcaption>A few more tote bag details.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/BN_Conf_2017_Identity_Summary_Bags_05.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2017 Brand New Conference by UnderConsideration\" \/>\n<figcaption>With the colorful neon lights of the venue, the bags looked extra groovy.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Badges<\/h1>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/BN_Conf_2017_Identity_Summary_Badges_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2017 Brand New Conference by UnderConsideration\" \/>\n<figcaption>Badges (sans strings because they were getting too much in the way).<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>At first, we wanted to buy a bunch of the fabric from the bags and use it for both the badges and the program but it cost, like, five times more to ship the fabric from China than the material itself, so we decided to use different reflective materials for each application. The problem with reflective materials is they are hard to work with and we picked a particularly hard one to do the badges: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.uline.com\/Product\/Detail\/S-11660\/Plastic-Retail-Food-Bags\/Food-Bags-Open-End-3-x-5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Super thin metallized poly bags<\/a>. After trying half a dozen methods to &#8220;print&#8221; on them ourselves we realized the only way to do it was with silkscreen but because the bags are so tiny and hard to work with, no printer wanted to do full-bleed, so we did what you do in this case, which was to silkscreen it ourselves, even though we had never done it. We got a DIY silkscreen kit, a drying rack from Craigslist, some advice from our friends at Industry Print Shop on what ink to use, and we got to it.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video controls><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/BN_Conf_2017_Identity_Summary_Silkscreening.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>DIY silkscreening.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>65% of the first print run came out like crap so we applied what we learned on it and banged out a thousand more bags the weekend before the event.

Additionally, we stretched the reflective concept into the pagination of the book by splitting day one&#8217;s speakers on the left side of the book and day two&#8217;s speakers on the right side. We emphasized this by splitting the book in half with the help of extended flaps that tucked into the center spread and directed readers to the appropriate side (a video further down below, under the &#8220;Reflectiveness&#8221; title, illustrates this). The layouts are &#8220;mirrored&#8221; too, so day two speakers were flush-left\/rag-right and day one speakers were flush-right\/rag-left.<\/p>\n<p>For the fourth year in a row we&#8217;ve had the pleasure of printing the program with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.classic-color.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Classic Color<\/a> and every year they continue to amaze us with their adventure-ness and quality.
