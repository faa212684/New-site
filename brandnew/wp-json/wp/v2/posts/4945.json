Right now, within my zip code, I could meet up with people hiking for tacos, fans of the Denver Broncos, or Settlers of Catan board game players. Instead I stay in to finish watching season two of <em>Narcos<\/em> &#8212; malparidos! &#8212; but if I wanted to I could easily join the 27.76 million members across 178 countries, and attend one of the 613,017 Meetups a month from any of the 257,754 Meetup groups. Last week, Meetup introduced a new identity designed by New York, NY-based <a href=\"http:\/\/sagmeisterwalsh.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sagmeister &amp; Walsh<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>There are lots of reasons to love Meetup&#8217;s nametag logo, but one important reason to ditch it. The nametag represents the most awkward moment in the entire Meetup experience\u200a&#8211;\u200athe moment you have to say hello to a complete stranger. [&hellip;] Now our logo represents why Meetup exists in the first-place\u200a&#8211;\u200ato bring people together to do the things that matter most to them. We call it the Meetup swarm, and it&#8217;s created when individual dots unite to form the &#8220;m&#8221; symbol.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/blog.meetup.com\/meetup-rebrand\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Meetup blog post<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/meetup_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Meetup by Sagmeister &amp; Walsh\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/meetup_monogram.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Meetup by Sagmeister &amp; Walsh\" \/>\n<figcaption>Monogram.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/meetup_monogram_animated.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Meetup by Sagmeister &amp; Walsh\" \/>\n<figcaption>Monogram animated.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo had the right idea and it actually communicated quickly and clearly what the network was about: meeting. I hadn&#8217;t thought about the name tag representing the awkward part of meeting as mentioned in the quote above but I do know that I very much dislike sticker name tags. Somehow they make everyone look like a doofus, even if they are charming and\/or smart. The execution of the old logo wasn&#8217;t great though and because of the lettering style they chose it felt too much like a corporate meeting of graffiti artists. Now that the Meetup name is well known and its offering well understood the logo doesn&#8217;t need to be as literal anymore and the new logo does away with any indication of what Meetup is about and instead puts its energy in conveying a kind of on-the-fringe aesthetic that reflects the idiosyncratic nature of some (or most) of the individual groups. Execution-wise the wordmark can do whatever it wants because its attitude (along with the rest of the brand images) is &#8220;I don&#8217;t care what you think; I know I&#8217;m cool&#8221; but as a piece of lettering it&#8217;s not the most impressive, engaging, or even pleasing. It&#8217;s fun and quirky, sure, but that&#8217;s about it.<\/p>\n<p>The monogram is more successful in that it communicates the &#8220;swarm&#8221; concept more convincingly and it has a bold, energetic presence perfect for social media avatars. The &#8220;M&#8221; is still too awkward for my taste but, as I&#8217;ve preached lately, I highly appreciate its effort for standing out in a sea of logo sameness.<\/p>\n<blockquote>During the initial discussions it became clear rather quickly that a simple logo change would not answer the difficulties that lay ahead: While we did look at the main visual signifier, the real challenge was to come up with a system that would allow a viewer to navigate the myriad of different possibilities in finding ones own community on a small screen efficiently and delightfully. We suggested a system that allows categories and subcategories to be navigated quickly, partly with the help of a limited number of symbolic colorful photography, partly by a large number of duotone based back-ground images that can be easily generated. We also suggested a whole slew of icons, illustrations and animations, inspired by the concept of swarming.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/sagmeisterwalsh.com\/work\/all\/meetup\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sagmeister &amp; Walsh project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/t30iD43VJh0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Introduction to the new app video.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/meetup_swarm_animation.mov\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Swarm animation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/meetup_icons.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Meetup by Sagmeister &amp; Walsh\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icons.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The swarm concept is solid for the company, it&#8217;s a simple and easy way to pitch the new look to its members, and it comes to life through animation quite well.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/meetup_business_cards.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Meetup by Sagmeister &amp; Walsh\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/meetup_materials.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Meetup by Sagmeister &amp; Walsh\" \/>\n<figcaption>Various materials.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/meetup_posters.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Meetup by Sagmeister &amp; Walsh\" \/>\n<figcaption>Posters.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The print materials and posters are all fun. For now. It&#8217;s maybe a little too much of a good thing with the bright colors and dots everywhere, which is great for a limited amount of time but eventually it might get tiring, repetitive, or even lose some of the appeal.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/meetup_categories_outdoor.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Meetup by Sagmeister &amp; Walsh\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/meetup_categories_scifi.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Meetup by Sagmeister &amp; Walsh\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/meetup_categories_learning.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Meetup by Sagmeister &amp; Walsh\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/meetup_categories_sports.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Meetup by Sagmeister &amp; Walsh\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/meetup_categories_fashion.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Meetup by Sagmeister &amp; Walsh\" \/>\n<figcaption>A few of the images created for the different categories:\nOutdoors &amp; Adventure, Sci-Fi &amp; Games, Learning, Sports &amp; Fitness, and Fashion &amp; Beauty. According to the Meetup blog all the models are Meetup members. You can see more at S&amp;W&#8217;s site or all of them on the Meetup home page. <\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">The other drastic element of the identity are these category images which have a very clear audience in mind: young and eccentric who probably like animated GIFs. Again, these are fun, but I think they alienate some parts of the audience by being 100% quirky and not allowing for the brand to have a slightly more serious side. This may be right on target for Meetup in which case hooray but I think it skews too heavily in one direction. But, hey, 27 million members can&#8217;t be wrong and I doubt these will have any negative impact on those numbers. Overall, I like the boldness and graphic spice it brings to a large, mainstream market but its heavy-handedness might wear thin quickly.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Launched in 2002, Meetup is a social network that allows groups of people with like-minded interests to organize and meet.
