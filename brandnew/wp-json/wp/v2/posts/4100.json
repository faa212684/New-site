Working for public and private clients, Interactive Group has helped establish Pakistan&#8217;s first cellular mobile network, enabled Pakistan television to broadcast globally via satellite, and launched Pakistan&#8217;s first mobile TV service. Earlier this year, Interactive Group introduced a new identity designed by Bucharest, Romania- and Singapore-based <a href=\"http:\/\/brandient.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brandient<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>Striving to construct a new, modern and vibrant visual identity for the company &mdash; one that illustrates the transformative power of technology and yet reflects the heritage of Pakistani culture &mdash; prompted a novel use of Pakistani national symbols as building blocks.<br \/><br \/>Thus, Brandient imagined the &#8220;Pentacrescent&#8221; &mdash; a three-dimensional piece that combines together five crescents into a proprietary star shape, an object-logo able to represent the reality of a truly multi-faceted, complex business and organization, and to allow for rich symbolism.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/brandient.com\/en\/client\/101\/interactive-group\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brandient project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/interactive_group_logo_genesis.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Interactive Group by Brandient\" \/>\n<figcaption>The crescent and star of the Pakistan flag serve as the structure for the logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/interactive_group_logo_detail.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Interactive Group by Brandient\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/interactive_group_pentacrescent_details.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Interactive Group by Brandient\" \/>\n<figcaption>&#8220;Pentacrescent&#8221; details.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo, I can&#8217;t even&hellip; but I have to so I shall: It&#8217;s the kind of logo you either think about or do as a joke of an extended clich&eacute; of what a technology company that does incomprehensible stuff would look like. I guess the triple infinity ring was okay but the typography, no thank you. The new logo, at first glance, also triggers a slight WTF? reaction but I actually think this is quite good. Particularly the origin of the icon from the merging of the the crescent and the star of the Pakistani flag. It&#8217;s very smart and taking it to the extreme end of the spectrum as a high-voltage 3D rendering is unexpected. The result is undeniably intriguing, like a <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Carambola\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">starfruit<\/a> that holds the power to open portals and the Decepticons are trying to capture it. In seriousness, though, I do think it signals bold ambitions and establishes Interactive Group as a corporation leading technology advancements in its country.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/interactive_group_wordmark.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Interactive Group by Brandient\" \/>\n<figcaption>Wordmark construction. Good thing they pointed out the notches because I had not noticed them.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The wordmark, I&#8217;m not as positive about. The notches are far too distracting and serve no conceptual purpose (or at least none that I read about). Something a little lighter and without an all uppercase approach would have paired better with the icon. Part of the problem is the lengthy (and generic) name too.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/interactive_group_stationery.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Interactive Group by Brandient\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stationery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/interactive_group_brochure.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Interactive Group by Brandient\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brochure.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/interactive_group_prkit.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Interactive Group by Brandient\" \/>\n<figcaption>PR kit.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/interactive_group_compositions.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Interactive Group by Brandient\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/interactive_group_compositions_with_message.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Interactive Group by Brandient\" \/>\n<figcaption>Pentacrescent and photograph combinations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/interactive_group_flags.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Interactive Group by Brandient\" \/>\n<figcaption>Flags.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">In application, the Pentacrescent takes on different hues and is used generously throughout, placed in layouts like an ever-present blimp. It may be a case of &#8220;Ooooooh, shiny&#8221; but I really like that thing, hard to justify more in words. The layouts have a good balance of party with the Pentacrescent and business with the typography. Overall, it&#8217;s a great improvement and we don&#8217;t tend to think of Pakistan as a place where corporations can have venturesome identities like this, so it&#8217;s a welcome surprise.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1984, Interactive Group is a telecommunications and information technology in Pakistan, providing a wide range of services like automation, hosting, storage, connectivity and security needs.
