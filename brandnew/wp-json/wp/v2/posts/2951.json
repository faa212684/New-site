If necessary, we will post an update.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>Our mission was to create a coherent identity with a visual expression that differs from the competitors. Our starting point for the new visual identity was to visualise natural health and wellbeing. The inspiration for the new symbol came from a tree&#8217;s growth rings which symbolise how Aleris provides care during all stages of life. The style of the symbol is reflected in all graphic elements of the new identity such as the pictograms and symbols which have been uniquely crafted for Aleris.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.boldstockholm.se\/news\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bold news page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/aleris_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Aleris by Bold\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>It&#8217;s almost disconcerting to see a bubbly, friendly identity in the healthcare industry, where it&#8217;s more common to have logos like the previous one for Aleris: an oddly space italic serif in this case, whose boldest claim to creativity was replacing the crossbar of the &#8220;A&#8221; with an egg-shaped dot. The new logo goes for rounded-edges amicability in both its concentric-shape icon and wordmark. The &#8220;A&#8221; isn&#8217;t wildly innovative but it is a nice-looking monogram and supports the tree-ring concept &mdash; although I never would have guessed it by just looking at it. The wordmark works as a proper base for the icon, extending the triangle shape of the &#8220;A&#8221;.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/aleris_identity_elements.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Aleris by Bold\" \/>\n<figcaption>Identity elements.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/aleris_other_applications.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Aleris by Bold\" \/>\n<figcaption>A few applications.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">In application, the concentric-line approach doesn&#8217;t hold up as well as it does on the logo. I mean&hellip; it&#8217;s okay, I don&#8217;t want to knock too much on that effort because I know how hard it is to make proper concentric graphics (as they&#8217;ve done here) but there is less abstraction on the numerals and some of the icons (like the cloud thing) maybe weren&#8217;t meant for this visual language. Nonetheless, this looks like a promising identity that should freshen up &mdash; in part thanks to the minty color palette &mdash; the healthcare experience for some Scandinavian folks.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Originally named ISS Health Care AB and renamed in 2005, Aleris is a healthcare company with operations in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark with 8,500 employees working across 350 locations offering &quot;specialist care, primary care and diagnostic care, elderly care and&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,72,26],"tags":[986,319,987,172,224],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2951"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2951"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2951\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2951"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2951"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2951"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
