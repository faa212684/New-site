Chanin School of Architecture, the Albert Nerken School of Engineering, and the School of Art, New York&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cooper.edu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art<\/a> is one of the most prestigious colleges in the city and the country &mdash; also one of the most selective, boasting the honor of having one of the lowest acceptance rates in the nation. But those that do get in are treated to a tuition-free education. In the design industry, its School of Art is quite celebrated, with many industrious and talented alumni, including the founding members of Push Pin Studios &mdash; Seymour Chwast, Reynold Ruffins, Edward Sorel, and Milton Glaser &mdash; as well as Herb Lubalin, Lou Dorfsman, Ellen Lupton, Abbott Miller, and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.doylepartners.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Stephen Doyle<\/a> who just had the task of designing the identity for the 150-year-old institution.<\/p><!--more--><p>As the Cooper Union prepares to open a new, contemporary building across the street, and celebrates its 150th anniversary, the time is just right for a new logo. Attempting to convey the relationship of science and art, Doyle arrived at a three-dimensional representation of a square &#8220;C&#8221; and &#8220;U&#8221; that, through color layering, create a unique and engaging new mark. Last week Steven Heller <a href=\"http:\/\/themoment.blogs.nytimes.com\/2009\/02\/12\/graphic-content-cooper-unions-new-logo\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">presented the new logo<\/a>, showing an animation of how the logo came to be, and is accompanied by some generous insight from Heller and Doyle.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m sure most people will complain that if you need a video to explain the logo it doesn&#8217;t work. Fine. But this logo works really well on its own. It&#8217;s vibrant and it&#8217;s distinctive, and the contrast between the bright, primary colors with the isometric rendering create an interesting tension between playful and serious.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cooper_union_stationery.gif\" alt=\"The Cooper Union Stationery\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Elements from the stationery suite.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cooper_union_stuff_01.jpg\" alt=\"The Cooper Union Stuff\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>A range of applications shown at the presentation stage.
