Playing off of the saying &#8220;Burn the candle at both ends&#8221;, the identity uses a series of semi-mirrored illustrations &#8212;\u00a0in the faces one is smiling, one frowning and in the sign one hand holds a fork the other a paint roller &#8212; that add an irreverent touch to the foundation of the more serious and seriously excellent typography throughout, from logos to menu to signage. My only complaint about this project is that there were way too many cool images to have to chose four from for this post, so definitely go see the rest. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/pda.studio\/clients\/makeready-libations-and-liberation\/makeready-ll\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Te Extra\u00f1o, Extra\u00f1o by Bienal<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_teextrano_extrano_a.jpg\" alt=\"Te Extra\u00f1o, Extra\u00f1o by Bienal\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/teextranoextrano.mx\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Te Extra\u00f1o, Extra\u00f1o<\/a> &#8212; which is directly translated as &#8220;I miss you, Stranger&#8221; in English but misses the play on words where <em>Extra\u00f1o<\/em> in Spanish means both a stranger and the act of missing someone &#8212; is a restaurant in M\u00e9rida, Yucat\u00e1n, Mexico, offering a contemporary take on traditional local dishes. With a slightly philosophical name where the stranger is not an actual stranger but the stranger within you, the identity, designed by local firm <a href=\"https:\/\/bienal.mx\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bienal<\/a> &#8212; yup, I am double-dipping into their portfolio in back-to-back weeks &#8212; gets a little groovy with some lovely thin-line illustrations of faces in a loose hand-drawn style. The primary illustration with the faces meeting at the eyes is great and could easily be the killer cover art for a book. The typography, in a typewriter font, alludes to writing letters and if you are in the right headspace it could all be interpreted as you sending yourself a letter about yourself. Or something deep like that. Either way, it&#8217;s a lovely identity and the food looks like something you would miss after you ate it. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/78224339\/TE-EXTRANO-EXTRANO\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Pinche Bar by Human<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_pinchebar_a.jpg\" alt=\"Pinche Bar by Human\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.pgbbq.mx\/pinchebar\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pinche Bar<\/a> &#8212; which also gets a little lost in translation because of the many nuances of <em>Pinche<\/em> in Mexico would be &#8220;This Fucking Bar&#8221; &#8212; is a bar in Mexico City that builds on the growing enterprise that is &#8220;Pinche Gringo BBQ&#8221;, which started as a food truck and now operates in a giant warehouse.
