This past May, the team was awarded an expansion slot in the MLS and will begin play in 2019 and move into a fancy new stadium. Yesterday, FC Cincinnati introduced its new crest, designed by the local office of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.interbrand.com\/offices\/cincinnati\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Interbrand<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>Symbolism abounds in the new crest, meant to celebrate the city&#8217;s German heritage in a modern way. The lion&#8217;s crown pays homage to the &#8220;Queen City,&#8221; while the seven points of its mane are a nod to the seven hills of Cincinnati. The three-feathered wing represents the club&#8217;s three-year journey to MLS and, perhaps most noticeably, its tail takes a &#8220;c&#8221; shape.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mlssoccer.com\/post\/2018\/11\/12\/fc-cincinnati-mls-logo-and-colors\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MLS press release<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fc_cincinnati_logo_explanation.jpg\" alt=\"New Crest for FC Cincinnati by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo explanation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fc_cincinnati_logo.png\" alt=\"New Crest for FC Cincinnati by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo had a semi-decent good idea of turning a crown into an abstract ball but the proportions of the crown in relation to the shield were off the mark, leading to a huge ball\/crown. But more terrible, were the proportions of everything else, with a <em>huge<\/em> &#8220;FC&#8221;, small &#8220;Cincinnati&#8221;, and tiny lion that, at that size, looked like it was holding up a toothpick. Part of the problem with anything Cincinnati related is that it&#8217;s a super long word and not easy to work with but the new logo does a fantastic job in not just making it fit but making it prominent without sacrificing proportions anywhere else. The city name, set at a vertiginous angle, fits beautifully in the crest shape, which breaks away from the typical shield shape by adopting the contour of a single panel of a soccer ball. It&#8217;s kind of amazing no team has (notably) done this before.<\/p>\n<p>The city name cuts the crest cleverly to fit a new lion in the lower portion and &#8220;FC&#8221; in the top portion. The &#8220;FC&#8221; element is probably the only minor complaint I would have about the crest in that it sits somewhat awkwardly in that space. The lion, if you can get past the dozen or so hidden rationalizations in it*, is mostly a great drawing &#8212; the wing looks like it was designed by someone else &#8212; that works great in that orange shape.<\/p>\n<p>In general, the new crest is great. It has a kind of vintage Italian car racing aesthetic with a modern twist that is quite appealing.<\/p>\n<p>* It&#8217;s lovely that they were able to build all those little details in the main and wing but the explanation graphic starts to border on looking like a parody.<\/p>\n<blockquote>The club&#8217;s new secondary mark is the stylized FCC from the full wordmark, while stand-alone tertiary elements will eventually include the full lion from the crest, the lion&#8217;s head and mane, and the crown. Those elements will be introduced more prominently in future years as the brand gains traction in the marketplace.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fccincinnati.com\/post\/2018\/11\/12\/fcc-unveils-its-major-league-soccer-logo-marks-colors\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FC Cincinnati press release<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fc_cincinnati_secondary_02.png\" alt=\"New Crest for FC Cincinnati by Interbrand\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fc_cincinnati_secondary_01.png\" alt=\"New Crest for FC Cincinnati by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Secondary marks.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The secondary marks are fine but not as exciting as the crest. The &#8220;C&#8221;s having such a pronounced angled feature makes them stand out in a weird way. Perhaps the crossbar of the &#8220;A&#8221; could have been angled too. The crown works well on its own on top of the &#8220;C&#8221; and I do like how the bottom of the &#8220;F&#8221; is a continuation of the &#8220;C&#8221; to its right.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fc_cincinnati_merch_promo_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Crest for FC Cincinnati by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Merch promo images.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fc_cincinnati_merch_scarves.jpg\" alt=\"New Crest for FC Cincinnati by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Scarves.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Merch looks great.
