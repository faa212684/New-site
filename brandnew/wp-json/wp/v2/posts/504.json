Along with the new logo, designed by L.A.-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.groundzero.net\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ground Zero<\/a>, comes a new campaign slogan, &#8220;People are smart.&#8221; The irony is I can&#8217;t quite figure out what the new logo represents. Or maybe I&#8217;m not their kind of people.<\/p><!--more--><p>The pluses: the new logo solidifies ditech as a serious company; the color scheme is much improved; and instead of a drastic change just to change it, they stuck to a clean typeface.<\/p>\n<p>The minuses: the cross bar of the t seems to be lacking major punch. When it&#8217;s the only emphasis it should have more of an impact &mdash; this doesn&#8217;t do much for the mark. The other downfall is the addition of the tagline. Why so small? I am a fan of small type but sized next to the logo the tagline is disproportional. Overall the mark is a step up but isn&#8217;t memorable enough to have lasting power. Maybe another redesign is on the way in a few years.<\/p>\n<p>To learn more see <a href=\"http:\/\/www.atretailmediaexpo.com\/atretail\/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003589636\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">article in AdWeek<\/a>.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":15,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,37,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/504"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/15"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=504"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/504\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=504"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=504"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=504"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
