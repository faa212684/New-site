They serve as the formal meeting of the UNFCCC Parties (Conference of the Parties, COP) to assess progress in dealing with climate change, and beginning in the mid-1990s, to negotiate the Kyoto Protocol to establish legally binding obligations for developed countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. From 2005 the Conferences have also served as the &#8220;Conference of the Parties Serving as the Meeting of Parties to the Kyoto Protocol&#8221; (CMP); also parties to the Convention that are not parties to the Protocol can participate in Protocol-related meetings as observers. From 2011 the meetings have also been used to negotiate the Paris Agreement as part of the Durban platform activities until its conclusion in 2015, which created a general path towards climate action.&#8221; (<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_Nations_Climate_Change_conference\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wikipedia<\/a>)<\/p><!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/un_climate_change_conference_logo_history.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 26th UN Climate Change Conference by Johnson Banks\" \/>\n<figcaption>History of the conference&#8217;s logos.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/un_climate_change_conference_logo_a.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 26th UN Climate Change Conference by Johnson Banks\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/389475629?title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0&#038;autoplay=1&#038;loop=1&#038;autopause=0&#038;background=1&#038;muted=1\" width=\"360\" height=\"203\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo animation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/un_climate_change_conference_logo_variations.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 26th UN Climate Change Conference by Johnson Banks\" \/>\n<figcaption>Different angles of the globe.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/un_climate_change_conference_tagline.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 26th UN Climate Change Conference by Johnson Banks\" \/>\n<figcaption>Tagline.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/un_climate_change_conference_website.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 26th UN Climate Change Conference by Johnson Banks\" \/>\n<figcaption>Website.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/un_climate_change_conference_insta_stories.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 26th UN Climate Change Conference by Johnson Banks\" \/>\n<figcaption>Instagram stories.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/un_climate_change_conference_poster.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 26th UN Climate Change Conference by Johnson Banks\" \/>\n<figcaption>Posters.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/un_climate_change_conference_calendar.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 26th UN Climate Change Conference by Johnson Banks\" \/>\n<figcaption>Calendar.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/un_climate_change_conference_tote_tshirt.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 26th UN Climate Change Conference by Johnson Banks\" \/>\n<figcaption>Tote and t-shirt.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/un_climate_change_conference_presentation.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 26th UN Climate Change Conference by Johnson Banks\" \/>\n<figcaption>David Attenborough launching the project at London&#8217;s Science Museum.
