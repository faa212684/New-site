For decades, oily, salty, salad olives have been re-purposed to garnish premium drinks. Filthy presents a delicious, balanced and memorable alternative that complements premium alcohol by not masking the subtle flavors of the cocktail, while adding to the guest&#8217;s overall experience. We don&#8217;t use a chemical curing process. Filthy olives are naturally fermented, so they retain the rich, nutty and woody flavor usually associated with olive oil. Why are we called Filthy? Life is not about dipping your toe in or getting a little dirty, it&#8217;s about getting FILTHY in everything you do because that&#8217;s where the joy is.&#8221;<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/filthy_food_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Filthy Food by Mother Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/filthy_food_logo_animation.gif\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Filthy Food by Mother Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo animation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/filthy_food_illustration_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Filthy Food by Mother Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Illustrations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/filthy_food_illustration_03_spot.gif\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Filthy Food by Mother Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Spot illustrations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/filthy_food_photography.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Filthy Food by Mother Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Photography.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/filthy_food_business_cards.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Filthy Food by Mother Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/filthy_food_old_packaging.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Filthy Food by Mother Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Samples of old packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/filthy_food_cans.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Filthy Food by Mother Design\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/filthy_food_cans_backs.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Filthy Food by Mother Design\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/filthy_food_cans_both.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Filthy Food by Mother Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Cans.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/filthy_food_pouches.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Filthy Food by Mother Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Pouches.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/439477925?title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"360\" height=\"203\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Brand video.
