Designed by Moscow-based <a href=\"http:\/\/madebyfork.ru\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fork<\/a>, this project has a wonderful simplicity to it, starting with the 8-letter logo divided into two neat, monospace lines. Even though it shouldn&#8217;t, the squarer sans serif of the logo works well with the condensed rounded sans and that definitely has to be the sexiest chopstick wrapper ever. <a href=\"http:\/\/madebyfork.ru\/projects\/marywong\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Le Jardin Colonial by Adrien Grant Smith Bianchi<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_jardincolonial.jpg\" alt=\"Le Jardin Colonial by Adrien Grant Smith Bianchi\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">This will the lamest game of Two Truths and a Lie: This is the lie. There is no way of writing a blurb about it and keeping it a mystery. Designed as a personal project by 21-year-old, Paris-based student, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/A-GrantSmithBianchi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Adrien Grant Smith Bianchi<\/a>, Le Jardin Colonial brings together the three passions he lists on his profile, &#8220;tea, gardens and graphic design&#8221;. Imagined as an <em>epicerie<\/em> selling all kinds of old-timey, old-world-y teas and goods, Adrien has gone where few designers are going today: an ornate, art nouveau-ish, patterned, bordered, natural-looking design aesthetic that feels oddly refreshing in how elaborate and fuzzy it is. Those shopping bags are the kind you would find in your grandma&#8217;s closet and you&#8217;d think, &#8220;Wow, grandma, cool!&#8221; and then she&#8217;d tell you a whole story about that time she was romanced by an Arab Sheik. Or something. Point is: wonderful imagined project that steps out of today&#8217;s minimalist-everything self-initiated projects. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/8430995\/Le-Jardin-Colonial\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project here<\/strong><\/a><\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Fatties by Dot Dash<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_fatties.jpg\" alt=\"Fatties by Dot Dash\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">Selling things like &#8220;cardamon and pistachio caramels, bags of passion fruit sherbet with pineapple lollipops, and coconut flour brownies&#8221;, <a href=\"http:\/\/fattiesbakery.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fatties<\/a> is a small London bakery with a provocative name. Yet, the logo design, created by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thisisdotdash.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dot Dash<\/a>, set in a thin, condensed rounded sans serif diffuses the situation with playful variations where one letter gets &#8220;fat&#8221; not by getting bold but by stretching out wide. It&#8217;s an interesting juxtaposition of verbal and visual elements that you will most likely forget the moment you stuff your face with one of their concoctions. While I enjoy the logo, I&#8217;m not convinced by the heavily-used texture that is meant to evoke the &#8220;floured surfaces seen in bakeries&#8221;, it feels harsh in contrast to the logo and color palette. Nonetheless, put <a href=\"http:\/\/identitydesigned.com\/images\/dot-dash\/fatties-bakery-15.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this<\/a> in front of me and I&#8217;ll forgive anything. <a href=\"http:\/\/identitydesigned.com\/fatties-bakery\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Today we have a food-themed set of Friday Likes and a game of Two Truths and a Lie, with one of these projects from Moscow, Paris, and London, not being real&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[1065,564,478],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3363"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3363"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3363\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3363"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3363"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3363"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
