Based on this idea of individual elements, Sydney-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.re-blog.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Re:<\/a> has created a simple wordmark with various break points &mdash; best shown in <a href=\"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/103619827\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this video<\/a> &mdash; that are used to place the logo in key places of print materials to break it, bend it, and crop it. It makes for engaging applications that maintain an otherwise sparse aesthetic infused with punches of the bright color palette. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/19106079\/Ridley\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">London Fields Soap by One Darnley Road<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_londonfieldssoap.jpg\" alt=\"London Fields Soap by One Darnley Road\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">More packaging than identity, these labels by London-based <a href=\"http:\/\/onedarnleyroad.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">One Darnley Road<\/a> for <a href=\"http:\/\/londonfieldssoap.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">London Fields Soap<\/a> make sure that you can see, feel, and smell the vegetarian and 98% organic contents of the soap. The dense black and white patterns contrast beautifully against the muted colors of the soap and the bare minimum typography complements the art deco\/nouveau style fusion quite nicely. <a href=\"http:\/\/onedarnleyroad.com\/work\/london-fields-soap-company\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Carlotta by Anagrama<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_carlotta.jpg\" alt=\"Carlotta by Anagrama\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">For Carlotta, a new, high-end bakery in Nuevo Le&oacute;n, Mexico (no website yet), <a href=\"http:\/\/www.anagrama.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Anagrama<\/a> is going old-old school by drawing visual cues from late 1800s-early 1900s Mexico when Porfirio Diaz was President for seven terms. I can attest to how well they nailed it: Those tea mini cans above (bottom left) look exactly like the stuff I would see everywhere in my grandma&#8217;s house, who was born in 1916 and had plenty of artifacts from her parents. The flower backgrounds are so well done, with plenty of white space and just the right amount of color. The typography isn&#8217;t my favorite but it works in conjunction with the pattern. My favorite element is the off-center, black frame that bends around the corners of the boxes and bags. As usual, very pretty stuff from Anagrama. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.anagrama.com\/portafolio\/188-carlotta\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project here<\/strong><\/a><\/strong>.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Plenty of variety today with colorful stuff, non-colorful stuff, stuff with backgrounds, stuff without backgrounds, and other stuff with work from Sydney, London, and Mexico&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[953,1065,956,53,769],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3554"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3554"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3554\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3554"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3554"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3554"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
