The company does an effort to have zero waste and repurposes all of its by-product to make teas, scrubs and organic dehydrated pet treats and Andrew is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.macmillan.org.uk\/about-us\/media-centre\/our-celebrity-supporters\/andrew-cooper.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a brand ambassador<\/a> for Macmillan Cancer Support, so it&#8217;s all a good way to capitalize on his fame.

Enough of the kale and the codswallop. We&#8217;re all fed up being made to feel guilty. Juiceman is about good vibes, living life, and healthy hedonism. We call this Fuel for Modern Living.<br \/><br \/>Juiceman is a purely\u00a0positive brand, with no artificial ingredients. Made from fresh, vibrant colours, uplifting illustrations, and copy that packs a punch. Made for maximum stand-out on the shelves of supermarkets across the globe.<br \/><br \/>[Rock &#8216;n&#8217; Roll is the] magic ingredient. Designed to ensure we don&#8217;t take ourselves too seriously. It&#8217;s just juice after all. So whether you repaying for the night before, or paying it forward for the future, remember:\u00a0 Juiceman doesn&#8217;t judge.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nomadstudio.com\/work\/juiceman\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nomad project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/juiceman_brand.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Juiceman by Nomad\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brand positioning.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/juiceman_logo.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Juiceman by Nomad\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo (with subtle animation).<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo was not good at all, unless each juice was squeezed by bare hands and all the workers&#8217; hands were tinted from squeezing beets and kale all day long. There was also something murder-y about it, with the inked palm. The wordmark was fine, I guess, but far from interesting. The new logo is interesting, for sure, although I&#8217;m not exactly sure what is going on with it. After seeing the animation I would come to the conclusion that&#8217;s either depicting a smile or a juice-compressing technique. Either way, it&#8217;s not the most attractive of logos and even by Rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll standards there is something very awkward about how the two lines of text come together, especially the &#8220;I&#8221; over the &#8220;A&#8221;. I&#8217;m also not keen on the logo breaking the &#8220;Juiceman&#8221;\n name into &#8220;Juice&#8221; and &#8220;Man&#8221; as it takes away from one key point of recognition for the brand.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/juiceman_color_palette.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Juiceman by Nomad\" \/>\n<figcaption>Color palette.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/juiceman_typography.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Juiceman by Nomad\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/juiceman_typography_02.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Juiceman by Nomad\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/juiceman_rocknroll.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Juiceman by Nomad\" \/>\n<figcaption>Typography.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/juiceman_ingredient_illustrations.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Juiceman by Nomad\" \/>\n<figcaption>Fruit and vegetable illustrations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/juiceman_ingredient_raw_real.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Juiceman by Nomad\" \/>\n<figcaption>&#8220;Raw &amp; Real&#8221; ingredients.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The ingredients, as it were, are much more engaging and cool than the logo, mixing rough-hewn illustrations and typography that, even though the play slightly on the clich\u00e9 of <em>looking<\/em> organic, work nicely in combination and convey a bold, youthful attitude for the brand.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/juiceman_category_animation_sports.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Juiceman by Nomad\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/juiceman_category_animation_moods.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Juiceman by Nomad\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/juiceman_category_animation_emojis.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Juiceman by Nomad\" \/>\n<figcaption>Animations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/juiceman_packaging_old.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Juiceman by Nomad\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/juiceman_packaging_old_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Juiceman by Nomad\" \/>\n<figcaption>Samples of old packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old packaging&#8230; same thing as the logo (especially since it&#8217;s basically the logo on a bottle)&#8230; and also not very appetizing to have a giant dirty hand on a drinking product.

I realize there isn&#8217;t a lot of room to play with on those clear labels but there is something very straightforward about the bottles that lacks excitement and perhaps it&#8217;s the desire to show off the product inside through clear labels that doesn&#8217;t allow the design elements to really stand out. The new bottles are infinitely better than the old ones for sure but it feels like each element &#8212; logo, juice name, and illustrations &#8212; are each on their own but happened to find themselves in the same place and weren&#8217;t sure what to do together.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/juiceman_cold_pressed_milk.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Juiceman by Nomad\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/juiceman_snacks.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Juiceman by Nomad\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/juiceman_pouch.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Juiceman by Nomad\" \/>\n<figcaption>Renders of other products.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/juiceman_web.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Juiceman by Nomad\" \/>\n<figcaption>Website.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/juiceman_app.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Juiceman by Nomad\" \/>\n<figcaption>App.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/juiceman_posters.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Juiceman by Nomad\" \/>\n<figcaption>Posters.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/241851242?color=ff3008&#038;title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"940\" height=\"529\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Identity introduction.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">Overall &#8212; and perhaps I was too critical of the details &#8212; this is a major improvement that gives Juiceman a more clear personality and tone of voice that is bold, vibrant, and accessible while upgrading the shelf presence from something that looked home-spun to a mainstream consumer product.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Launched in 2015, Juiceman is a brand of cold-pressed juices available in the UK.
