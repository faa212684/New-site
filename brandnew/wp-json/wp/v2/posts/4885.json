In other words, a hell of a Saturday night. The identity by local designer <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/oscarmaia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Oscar Maia<\/a> is full-on and unapologetically vintage which means there is nothing necessarily original about it but it looks damn great. The typography is handled perfectly and evokes the old-timey vibe of a classic barbershop almost too successfully. The &#8220;services&#8221; sheet alone is pure gold. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/41258111\/Barbearia-Porto-Visual-Identity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Happy Rabbit by Un Barco<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_happyrabbitt.jpg\" alt=\"Happy Rabbit by Un Barco\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Happy-Rabbit-463081403845817\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Happy Rabbit<\/a> is a boutique apparel line for kids based in Argentina. Their identity by Buenos Aires-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.unbarco.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Un Barco<\/a> &#8212; whose work looks like the visualization of a Damien Rice song &#8212; features a charming carrot with what could be interpreted as either bunny ears or a bow tied on top. Either way, it&#8217;s totally adorable. I wish the typography were a little better or at least more consistent in weight with the icon. Nonetheless, in all the fluffy applications, the logo works great and makes all of Happy Rabbit&#8217;s items look more huggable than they already are. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/37300451\/Happy-Rabbit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">The Glamoury by Glasfurd and Walker<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_glamoury.jpg\" alt=\"The Glamoury by Glasfurd and Walker\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.theglamoury.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Glamoury<\/a> is a hairdo and make-up salon in Vancouver, Canada, with, well, a fairly glamorous approach and a salon that looks straight out of the classical Hollywood cinema era. Designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.glasfurdandwalker.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Glasfurd and Walker<\/a>, the identity revolves around a custom art deco-ish typeface with delicate contrast in its thicks and thins that looks great in gold against the deep green backgrounds. A monogram &#8220;G&#8221; embedded in a diamond-slash-pill device provides some visual richness to otherwise minimal applications.
