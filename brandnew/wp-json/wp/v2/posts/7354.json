Launched originally with her husband Andy Spade with a small collection of six utilitarian nylon handbags designed by Kate Brosnahan Spade (1962 &#8211; 2018), the brand gained quick popularity for its colorful and effusive designs. Today it counts with 275 stores worldwide; 4,800 employees; and has $1 billion in revenue. With the launch of the Spring 2019 under the direction of new creative director, Nicola Glass, Kate Spade introduced a new identity earlier this year.<\/p>\n<!--more--><p>There is no design credit but I assume it was either done in-house or by <a href=\"http:\/\/partnersandspade.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> Partners &amp; Spade<\/a>, the design firm established by Andy Spade, or a combination of the two. Also, all images in this post are taken from Instagram, so the resolution is not the greatest but it gets the point across.

The old one would be more regularly paired with the spade while the new one drops it from the logo since, as you will see, it becomes a big part of the products. The new logo now appears inside a pink box with a white border. It&#8217;s not a huge change but it certainly forces it into new uses that make it feel like an evolution of the original even if, for the most part, it&#8217;s only the introduction of a container box that&#8217;s different. I believe the wordmark has been made a little bolder but unfortunately I couldn&#8217;t find a vector or high-res version to really compare.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Update:<\/strong> The logo was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/Bt4RrZdH1y0\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">redrawn by Commercial Type<\/a> and a number of optical sizes have been created for different uses.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kate_spade_ny_logo_sizes.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Kate Spade\" \/>\n<figcaption>Optical size variations of the logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>our new spade. we&#8217;ve reimagined our signature mark in lots of new ways and thoughtfully worked it into all of our designs for an unexpected surprise.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/instagram.com\/katespadeny\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kate Spade Instagram posts<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kate_spade_ny_icon_a.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Kate Spade\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icon.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The new spade, as an icon, is lovely &#8212; if you have read Brand New for an extended period of time, you know I am a sucker for ink traps, so it&#8217;s no surprise I&#8217;m really digging this. Aside from personal preferences, what this new spade does very well is look more unique and not like something you would see in a hundred different deck of cards. In the the hardware of the bags (below) and the pattern (further down below), the spade silhouette changes a bit to adapt to its use but the overall shape is super pleasant and how it can transform into a heart when flipped is a major bonus.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kate_spade_ny_icon_lock.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Lock mechanism.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kate_spade_ny_enamel_studs.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Kate Spade\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kate_spade_ny_enamel_studs_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Kate Spade\" \/>\n<figcaption>Enamel studs.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kate_spade_ny_bag_icon_sample_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Kate Spade\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sample locks on bags.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kate_spade_ny_bag_icon_sample.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Kate Spade\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icon detail on the bag.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>our new spade flower pattern: it&#8217;s another way we&#8217;re weaving our spade into our designs. every blossom is made up of four spades. we&#8217;ve embossed this one on smooth leather with 3-d printed patent for our new nicola bag using a technique we developed with one of our tanneries in italy.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/instagram.com\/katespadeny\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kate Spade Instagram posts<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kate_spade_ny_pattern_embossed.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Kate Spade\" \/>\n<figcaption>Embossed pattern on leather.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>our new tissue paper. you&#8217;ll get an even closer look at it when you open one of our new boxes.
