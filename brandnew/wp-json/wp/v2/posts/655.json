Yes, that&#8217;s the full name. The new firm now counts with 300 employees across New York, Chicago, Cincinnati, Paris, Brussels, Tokyo, Seoul, Hong Kong and Shanghai. Leading the firm are Jo&euml;l Desgrippes and Laga&#8217;s Jim Barrett, and there is no mention of what happened to Marc Gob&eacute; who was the more public face of d\/g. Read on if you are ready for some press-releasing.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>According to Barrett, <em>Brandimage<\/em> was selected as the name of the new company because it represents what the agency ultimately provides to its clients. &#8220;Through our exclusive <em>Brand Vision<\/em> approach we unite thinking and imagination, logic and emotion, and intent and outcome holistically to create a real brand strategy,&#8221; says Barrett. &#8220;Then we bring it to life through our <em>Brand Presence<\/em> process that takes different expressions of the brand across all points of consumer interaction. That is how we build strong brands and deliver rich emotional brand experiences to consumers.&#8221;<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.brand-image.com\/data\/Brandimage_release_6_5_08.pdf\">Press Release [PDF]<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/brandimage_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"Brand Image Logo, Detail\" \/><\/p>\n<blockquote>&#8220;Brandimage draws its strength in the synthesis of European sensitivity with American innovation and the pioneering spirit of Asia.&#8221;<br \/>&mdash; Desgrippes<\/blockquote>\n<p>I always wondered what the combination of European sensitivity, American innovation, and Asia&#8217;s pioneering spirit would look like. And, unfortunately, now I know: Purple Helvetica Extended. Bland, clunky, pedestrian. I&#8217;m really, really surprised at how unsophisticated this new identity is; d\/g has created some convincing designs (most notably for me, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/speakup\/archives\/001889.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the Travelocity logo<\/a>, and less notably <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/payless_suckmore.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the Payless logo<\/a>) in the past and their wordmark was pretty decent and while I can&#8217;t picture anything that Laga has done in the past, I don&#8217;t remember being down right appalled by the result. I realize a lot of it is subjective opinion, but mine is that Helvetica Extended is a not a good typeface &mdash; and even if there is no such thing as a &#8220;bad typeface&#8221; and that it&#8217;s all in the use, well, this one doesn&#8217;t succeed at that either. In deep sleep dreaming with puppies and chocolate ice cream I can think of a dozen better typefaces for a wordmark designed in the year 2008: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.myfonts.com\/fonts\/fontfont\/ff-scala\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Scala<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.vllg.com\/Lux\/Section\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Section<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.vllg.com\/Thirstype\/ApexSans\/mudTyper+Weights\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Apex Sans<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.typography.com\/fonts\/font_overview.php?productLineID=100026\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Whitney<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fontbureau.com\/fonts\/TitlingGothicFB\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Titling Gothic<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.houseind.com\/index.php?page=showfont&#038;id=615&#038;subpage=neutra_no2_view_fonts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Neutra 2<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.monotype.co.uk\/sgMF\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Soho Gothic<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.p22.com\/products\/underground.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Underground Pro<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.myfonts.com\/fonts\/fontfont\/bau\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bau<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.vllg.com\/Schwartzco\/StagSans\/mudTyper+Weights\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Stag Sans<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.typography.com\/fonts\/font_overview.php?productLineID=100008\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gotham<\/a> or, heck, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fonts.com\/findfonts\/detail.htm?pid=201477\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Helvetica Medium<\/a>. <\/p>\n<p>An execution like this might be expected from a long-drawn process between a branding firm and the mythical client who assumedly has no design taste that waters everything down&hellip; but this result from a branding firm branding itself? Yikes. And I haven&#8217;t even talked about the star yet: It&#8217;s unnecessary, distracting and also poorly executed, there is no rhyme or reason to it. In contrast to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/enterprise_gets_unionized.php\">Brand Union<\/a> that used the term &#8220;brand&#8221; and created something daring, whether you liked it or not, Brandimage is a step backwards in naming and design for two firms that were doing a decent job in representing themselves with previously sophisticated wordmarks &mdash; Laga&#8217;s old logo was actually quite remarkable.<\/p>\n<p>Reinventing a large branding firm from within should yield, at least, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.landor.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sophisticated results<\/a> and, at best, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wolffolins.com\/about.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">defying results<\/a> &mdash; surely not uninspired results.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[71,12,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/655"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=655"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/655\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=655"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=655"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=655"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
