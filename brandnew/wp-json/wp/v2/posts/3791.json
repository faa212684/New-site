Designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fodastudio.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">F&Ouml;DA<\/a>, the abstract CHAVEZ glyphs are arranged in blocks and circles, it&#8217;s printed on menus and business cards, and it&#8217;s etched on tabletops and lit from underneath. It&#8217;s groovy and hypnotic and manages to convey &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.austinchronicle.com\/food\/2009-03-06\/751674\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Interior Mexican<\/a>&#8221; quite deliciously. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fodastudio.com\/main\/project\/150\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project here<\/strong><\/a><\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Not Monday by Bienal<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_notmonday.jpg\" alt=\"Not Monday by Bienal\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/notmonday.mx\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Not Monday<\/a> is a small store of design goods in M&eacute;rida, Mexico &mdash; a place known more for its Mayan ruins and folk art than availability of contemporary design objects. Adding to the fish-out-of-water sentiment is a quirky, typewriter logo that plays off its name in a clever way, turning the &#8220;o&#8221; into a prohibition sign. This identity by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/bienal.mx\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bienal<\/a> isn&#8217;t as visually explosive as other Friday Likes entries but it has a charm and warmth to it that others sometimes lack. My favorite element is the clock-like &#8220;Design Everyday&#8221; graphic that works just as well rubber stamped on a bag as it does in signage behind the cash register. <a href=\"http:\/\/bienal.mx\/en\/portafolio\/24\/not-monday\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project here<\/strong><\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">A Design Film Festival 2014 by Anonymous<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_designfilmfestival.jpg\" alt=\"A Design Film Festival 2014 by Anonymous\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">This past July, Singapore-based design firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.anonymous.com.sg\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Anonymous<\/a> held its fourth <a href=\"http:\/\/www.designfilmfestival.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A Design Film Festival<\/a>, which is exactly what the title suggests. For 2014, Anonymous went full noir with a range of patterns foil stamped black on black stock for the tickets and another set of patterns playing off the theme &mdash; &#8220;On a Scale of Art to Design&#8221; &mdash; adorn the tote bags and program guides. It&#8217;s design-y, it&#8217;s film-y. It&#8217;s just right for the audience. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.anonymous.com.sg\/#projects\/adesignfilmfestival2014\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Plenty of patterns and cool production techniques in this week&#8217;s selection with work from Austin, M&eacute;rida, and Singapore&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[906,564,149],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3791"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3791"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3791\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3791"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3791"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3791"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
