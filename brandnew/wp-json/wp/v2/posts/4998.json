With over 30,000 employees and a fleet of close to 120 airplanes, Qantas flies to more than 80 destinations.

Then I realized I didn&#8217;t write that review! While I do think the 2007 kangaroo icon was better than its predecessor I wouldn&#8217;t call it &#8220;beautiful&#8221; and I certainly wouldn&#8217;t have praised the extra-italic wordmark and its wonky curves nor deem it improved. To summarize: The old kangaroo kept the exaggerated shape of previous ones while making it more readable and having more sweeping and defined curves but the wordmark tried too hard to look aerodynamic with an unnecessarily slanted angle.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/qantas_2016_icon_animation.gif\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Livery for Qantas by Houston Group\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icon construction.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Regarding the new&#8230; The kangaroo maintains the overall shape and similar motion but has been heavily abstracted by removing its arms and losing definition in the head. The main reason we know it&#8217;s a kangaroo it&#8217;s because we know Qantas has had a kangaroo forever but it&#8217;s questionable whether this looks like a kangaroo anymore. Not that it has to be a literal representation &#8212; I can go to a zoo to see a true-to-life one &#8212; but if they are still trying to sell me on the idea that this is a kangaroo, I&#8217;m not buying it so easily. It&#8217;s stuck somewhere between its legacy and wanting to be a signifier for air-travel-of-the-future&#8230; it&#8217;s almost like a swooshy abstract mark for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.virgingalactic.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Virgin Galactic<\/a>. I would love to say that I love its curves and shading because clearly effort has gone into it but I&#8217;m not feeling it at all.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/qantas_2016_icon_render.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Livery for Qantas by Houston Group\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icon rendering.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/qantas_2016_icon_render_phone.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Livery for Qantas by Houston Group\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icon rendering, cropped inside an iPhone.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/qantas_2016_icon_corner.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Livery for Qantas by Houston Group\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icon in a corner.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The kangaroo gets more shading in these renderings which, sure, are attractive and provide a kind of sexy, luxurious vibe.<\/p>\n<blockquote>The key opportunity for us was in contemporising the &#8216;roo. Making it more streamlined, and simplifying the shape. It&#8217;s evolved beyond a literal kangaroo &#8211; it&#8217;s become a unique brand symbol. We spent just as long handcrafting the Qantas logotype. We focussed on making it more streamlined, as if air is pushing across the top.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/houstongroup.com.au\/projects\/qantas-rebrand\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Houston Group project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/qantas_2016_wordmark_before.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Livery for Qantas by Houston Group\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/qantas_2016_wordmark_after.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Livery for Qantas by Houston Group\" \/>\n<figcaption>Wordmark, before and after.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/qantas_2016_type_animation.gif\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Livery for Qantas by Houston Group\" \/>\n<figcaption>Custom font structure.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/qantas_2016_type_poster.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Livery for Qantas by Houston Group\" \/>\n<figcaption>Custom font.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The wordmark, though, <em>that<\/em> I really like.

Yesterday, on the FLOR project, I was mentioning how hard &#8220;S&#8221;s are to draw and this one almost nails it; the middle part gets too stiff right in the center but it has some nice sweeping curves. I don&#8217;t know about no &#8220;air is pushing across the top&#8221; as mentioned in the project page so I would have settled for &#8220;it looks cool.&#8221;<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/qantas_2016_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Livery for Qantas by Houston Group\" \/>\n<figcaption>Full logo with tagline.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The overall lock-up seems like a part of a slow-burning trend where all icons take the shape of the plane&#8217;s tail with the wordmark forming the fuselage. I get it. It&#8217;s fine. The extended wordmark in this case works very well with the icon to convey the airplane illusion. The tagline, set in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.myfonts.com\/fonts\/emtype\/ciutadella\/?refby=ucllc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ciutadella<\/a> (which becomes the main typeface throughout), feels very disconnected.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/qantas_2016_livery_evolution.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Livery for Qantas by Houston Group\" \/>\n<figcaption>Livery over the years.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/qantas_2016_livery_old.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Livery for Qantas by Houston Group\" \/>\n<figcaption>Old livery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/qantas_2016_livery.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Livery for Qantas by Houston Group\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/qantas_2016_livery_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Livery for Qantas by Houston Group\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/qantas_2016_livery_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Livery for Qantas by Houston Group\" \/>\n<figcaption>New livery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/plugins\/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FQantas%2Fvideos%2F10154021517502686%2F&#038;show_text=0&#038;width=560\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowTransparency=\"true\" allowFullScreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>New livery paint job time lapse.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The livery didn&#8217;t change much.

It&#8217;s a decent typeface but there is something about it that doesn&#8217;t feel ready for the big leagues as a corporate\/brand typeface. I&#8217;m not trying to be critical just for the sake of it or because I enjoy it (I do but not just to be mean) and bring almost everything about this project down but there is something informal about it or maybe it&#8217;s the very vertical aesthetic it has as all round characters are flat on the sides. This might just be a personal caveat as, really, there is nothing offensive about the typeface.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/qantas_2016_posters.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Livery for Qantas by Houston Group\" \/>\n<figcaption>Posters. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_\/\u00af<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">The posters above &#8212; and here maybe I AM being mean &#8212; are totally random (what&#8217;s up with that blob?!) but I guess they are trying to capture the fluidity and grooviness of the new identity. Overall, there is a strong sense of &#8220;newness&#8221; and new-car-smell while building on the existing equity of the key Qantas elements so, despite any misgivings I have, it&#8217;s a successful redesign&#8230; it just doesn&#8217;t get me hopping with joy.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1920 (originally named Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Services), Qantas is the flag carrier of Australia and its largest domestic and international airline.
