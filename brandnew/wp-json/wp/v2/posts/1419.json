Their shoes feature a unique die-cut of an <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Aster_(genus)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Aster (<em>Diplopappus<\/em>) flower<\/a>,  a shape recently upgraded to brand icon status. The redesign, led by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bayaderes.fr\/\">Bayaderes<\/a>,  includes a refined color palette and a playful script.<\/p><!--more--><p>The aster flower has figured prominently in the history of the brand.  Always present on their shoes, but often used differently in their logo. The new icon resembles the shoe&#8217;s iteration much more closely,  establishing a greater link between brand and product. In this case, the  connection is mutually beneficial, increasing memorability of the logo  and distinctiveness of the shoes.<\/p>\n<p><p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Aster_shoe.jpg\" width=\"574\" height=\"279\" alt=\"Aster\" \/><br alt=\"Aster\" \/>\n<p class=\"caption\">The aster shape is now present throughout the brand<\/p>\n<p>The new script, while slightly uneven (the capital A seems awkwardly thicker than the remaining letterforms) is a vast improvement on the clunky sans serif of the previous identity.  In addition, the artificially bright color palette of the earlier logo has been replaced by a more sophisticated set of colors which  are displayed prominently on the branded materials.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Aster_box.jpg\" width=\"574\" height=\"333\" alt=\"Aster\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The creators of the new logo refer to the icon as an &#8216;aster-isk,&#8217; the look of which is reinforced by the squared petals, and placement  above the script. While clever, this seems like an unnecessary level of  differentiation when the brand&#8217;s overall goal is to celebrate its original form.<\/p>\n<p>One oversight seems to be the lack of die-cut applications &mdash; a die-cut business card or shopping bag would be a natural extension for this icon, given its  historic application on the shoes.<\/p>\n<p><p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Aster_book.jpg\" width=\"574\" height=\"342\" alt=\"Aster\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">The secondary typeface, as shown on the guideline document above is a less successful brand expression.<\/p>\n<p><p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Aster_bag.jpg\" width=\"574\" height=\"342\" alt=\"Aster\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Additional branded materials.<\/p>\n<p>There is a greater sense of authenticity to the revised logo: the color palette is richer, the typeface communicates a more genuine personality and the icon connects the brand to the product.  Since the website still features the old identity, it&#8217;s hard to judge the scope and seriousness of the redesign, but if the new system is applied as consistently as these visuals suggest, this should be a big improvement for the brand.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_110407_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_110407_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_110407_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_110407_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_110407_config_03.xml&#038;xyz=poll_110407_votes_03.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv3\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv3\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":9,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,51,26],"tags":[165,105,54,510],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1419"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/9"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1419"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1419\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1419"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1419"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1419"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
