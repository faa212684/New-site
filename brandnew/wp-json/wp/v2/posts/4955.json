Over 720,000 people attended this year&#8217;s tournament as Novak Djokovic defended his men&#8217;s title and Angelique Kerber took the women&#8217;s title from Serena Williams. With tickets for the 2017 tournament going on sale next week, the Australian Open has introduced a new identity designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/landor.com\/offices\/sydney\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Landor Australia<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>Mike Staniford, Executive Creative Director, Landor added &#8220;We wanted to create a living system which could animate and move in accordance with the dynamic of the game itself. A bold, energetic and active identity to reflect this leading sporting experience that embodies Australia.&#8217;<br \/><br \/>&#8220;The simplicity of the mark gives it the license to do almost anything. It&#8217;s not only a short hand to the Australian Open, it&#8217;s a mark that is a timeless icon that can be the vehicle of constant reinvention,&#8221; concluded Staniford.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/level11.com.au\/2016\/10\/05\/australian-open-changing-the-game\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Landor Australia blog post<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/australian_open_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Australian Open by Landor Australia\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo bordered on being bad and offensively bad. The icon of the player serving against the sunset was a very trite image and the holding shape it was in was fairly ridiculous. The wordmark was fine but it featured my most despised style of sans serif and I understand that that&#8217;s a very personal feeling. The new logo does away with any kind of tennis reference &#8212; which seems like there could have been a hint of it somewhere in those two giant letters &#8212; and focuses on the equity of the name. I&#8217;m not a big tennis fan so I don&#8217;t know if anyone refers to the Australian Open as &#8220;AO&#8221; but I kind of doubt it so it&#8217;s a little strange that the full name gets such a secondary role. As a monogram it&#8217;s effective though; it&#8217;s simple, bold, and way easier to reproduce. The wordmark is fine and geometric, matching squarely (and roundly) with the monogram. On its own, the logo is a little dry but it&#8217;s nicely activated in application.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/australian_open_patterns.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Australian Open by Landor Australia\" \/>\n<figcaption>Patterns.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/australian_open_animation_01.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<hr \/>\n<div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/australian_open_animation_02.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video>\n<figcaption>Animations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The &#8220;A&#8221; and &#8220;O&#8221; get infused with some livelines in the patterns, which could have used a little more finesse; they feel hurried and clunky but establish the flexibility of the two devices. The upward arrow becomes the leading element as it turns into fun graphic bursts that animate quite well. I wish there were more of these animated GIFs as they really add life to the identity. On the flip side, I wonder if they are too youthful or quirky for the tennis audience.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/australian_open_posters.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Australian Open by Landor Australia\" \/>\n<figcaption>Posters<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/australian_open_banners.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Australian Open by Landor Australia\" \/>\n<figcaption>Banners.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/australian_open_fb_banners.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Australian Open by Landor Australia\" \/>\n<figcaption>Facebook header images.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">The one thing that I don&#8217;t quite like is the color palette&#8230; There is something off about it that limits it from being much more sophisticated or attractive. I realize the green is tennis-ball-green but the other colors have a dated feel. The Facebook banners start to get too cutesy with the &#8220;A&#8221; from the logo; and maybe it&#8217;s not the fault of the graphic execution but the word &#8220;champ&#8221;&#8230; sounds like you are trying to console the kid that finished last. Overall, an improvement from the old for sure that lays the groundwork for some possibly interesting approaches in future tournaments.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"First held in 1905, the Australian Open is a major tennis tournament held annually every January in Melbourne, Australia, and is one of the four Grand Slam tournaments along with the French Open, Wimbledon, and the US Open.
