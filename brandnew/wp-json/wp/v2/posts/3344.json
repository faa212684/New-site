Rowr. The simple grid of the packaging works perfectly to combine one colorful pattern with one black and white pattern or image, offsetting the simple typography. The maximalist, white-space-less approach is a nice antidote to the usually clean look given to organic products. <a href=\"http:\/\/asketic.com\/project\/the-beginnings\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">VLT by Inland Studio<\/h1>\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/98039057?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=f0001c\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">Established in Argentina and broadcasting online, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.vamoslastablas.com\/somos-vlt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">VLT<\/a> &mdash; short for &#8220;Vamos las Tablas&#8221; (Let&#8217;s go Boards, referring to surf boards) &mdash; is a channel dedicated to extreme sports, particularly surfing, skating, and biking.

That&#8217;s really all you need to see. In the genre of Identity Stuff Photographed All Together at an Angle, this one wins. It&#8217;s just a beautiful image of simplicity. The identity, designed by London-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.morganstudio.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">John Morgan studio<\/a> for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.drdharchitects.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DRDH Architects<\/a>, isn&#8217;t the most exciting in the world but the commitment to putting the D, R, D, and H in the same configuration and relationship on every item makes for a curious overall package with some great moments like the project boxes on the top right of the image where two of the letters fall on the spine. Perusing DRDH&#8217;s website is also kind of interesting. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.morganstudio.co.uk\/project\/drdh_architects\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"We go from heavy textures to crazy animation to a heavy dose of white space in this Friday Likes with work from Riga, Buenos Aires, and London&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[287,953,769,335,1062],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3344"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3344"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3344\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3344"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3344"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3344"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
