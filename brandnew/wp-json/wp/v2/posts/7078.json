In the time since, the USL has strengthened its ties with the MLS, establishing affiliate connections between their teams and last year the U.S. Soccer Federation granted the USL Division II status. Beginning in 2019, as the league continues to grow, it will be introducing a new structure, akin to European leagues, where USL becomes the corporate brand of multiple leagues: USL Championship replaces what we all knew as USL proper and becomes the pinnacle of the USL; the Premier Development League becomes USL League Two, a development soccer league; and USL Division III will become USL League One, targeting cities with a population of 150,000 to one million, mostly in cities currently without a professional team. As part of the restructuring, USL has introduced a new identity system designed by Brooklyn, NY-based <a href=\"https:\/\/athleticsnyc.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Athletics<\/a> in partnership with USL&#8217;s in-house design team.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>Athletics was tasked with extending the USL brand across all of the organization&#8217;s events and leagues: The USL Championship, USL League 1, and USL League 2. We designed a modular color and logo system to create a flexible look and feel between each league, using a shared visual language to connect the initiatives together and with the USL brand.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/athleticsnyc.com\/projects\/usl\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Athletics project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/eM0pmnYyq-k\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Introduction of new logo system.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/usl_logo_2018_logo_leagues_before_after.png\" alt=\"New Logo System for USL by Athletics and In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>USL League Two and USL League One logos, before and after.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/usl_logo_2018_logos_all.png\" alt=\"New Logo System for USL by Athletics and In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo family.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/usl_logo_2018_logo_explanation_a.png\" alt=\"New Logo System for USL by Athletics and In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo explanations.

It now serves as the anchor for the new league structure and its logos. First up is the &#8220;corporate&#8221; logo that, in a way, replaces the 2015 logo. The biggest change here is the addition of a new icon, a speeding ball leaving a trail of 13 stripes (as in the U.S. flag), which I think is pretty fantastic &#8212; not for its patriotic-ness per se but for it&#8217;s appropriateness and smart use of it. The icon has an old-school feel that goes back to the good age of minimalism and not just minimalism for minimalism&#8217;s sake. The icon ties in nicely with the notches in the USL wordmark and it establishes a square element to build on with the rest of the logos.<\/p>\n<p>For the main league, now USL Championship, the square houses a star in a gold background. It&#8217;s pretty straightforward and it does convey a sense of being the most important in the system. I get some <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=us+army+logo&#038;safe=active&#038;source=lnms&#038;tbm=isch&#038;sa=X&#038;ved=0ahUKEwjQvK_H6NPeAhVq1oMKHUWyC5oQ_AUIEygB&#038;biw=1464&#038;bih=882\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">U.S. Army logo<\/a> vibes but when this lives in the context of soccer, there is not much confusion. The League One and League Two logos simply have a number in there. Again, very straightforward but also as nicely executed as it gets. All logos are now (or can be) accompanied by a geometric sans serif, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.myfonts.com\/fonts\/hurme\/geometric-sans-1-and-2\/?refby=ucllc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hurme Geometric Sans No.2<\/a>, that, as unsurprising as it is, works very well in this system and as a complement to the logo elements. The same type family, in its various weights, is used as the brand typography throughout.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/usl_logo_2018_logos_all_covers.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo System for USL by Athletics and In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logos with brand pattern.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/usl_logo_2018_type_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo System for USL by Athletics and In-house\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/usl_logo_2018_type_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo System for USL by Athletics and In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Type treatments.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/usl_logo_2018_broadcast_graphics.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo System for USL by Athletics and In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Screen graphics.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/usl_logo_2018_instagram.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo System for USL by Athletics and In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Instagram.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/usl_logo_2018_championship_ad.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo System for USL by Athletics and In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Ad.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/usl_logo_2018_championship_banner.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo System for USL by Athletics and In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Banner.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">Not much in terms of applications as this identity won&#8217;t kick in fully until the start of next season but there is some clear potential seen here through bold but simple typographic treatments and some color coding of black and white images. Overall, the system may come across as simple and an obvious approach but the result is remarkably smart, restrained, and crisply executed.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 2010, the United Soccer League (USL) began as a Division III league with 15 teams.
