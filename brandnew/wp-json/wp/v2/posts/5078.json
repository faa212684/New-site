Unfortunately, New York is so difficult to find a venue that matches our needs, budget, and preferred dates that, with all the pros and cons taken into account, it was better to change cities altogether. Apologies to those that were counting on BNConf coming back to New York &#8212; we were looking forward to it as well.<p>\n<p>So&#8230; <strong>The 2017 Brand New Conference will be in Chicago, NOT in New York<\/strong>.
