At the end of March the company <a href=\"http:\/\/www.manpowergroup.com\/investors\/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=560685\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">announced<\/a> a reorganization of its business and introduced ManpowerGroup as the parent company, replacing the lackluster Manpower Inc. With this move ManpowerGroup is also introducing a new mantra, that it is &#8220;differentiating and evolving its brand to reflect the new complexity and challenges brought by the Human Age.&#8221; You can watch a video that is as exciting as lapel pins on CEO&#8217;s suits of what the &#8220;Human Age&#8221; means <a href=\"http:\/\/www.manpowergroup.com\/humanage\/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a>. As part of this evolution, ManpowerGroup has also created logos and names for its four business solutions: ManpowerGroup Solutions, Experis, Manpower, and Right Management. The project was carried out by Richmond, VA-based <a href=\"http:\/\/martinagency.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Martin Agency<\/a>.<\/p><!--more-->\n<blockquote>The overall package, said Jeffrey A. Joerres, Manpower&#8217;s chairman, CEO and president, is not simply &#8220;a graphic artist&#8217;s exercise.&#8221; Rather, he said, it&#8217;s part of Manpower&#8217;s effort to position itself for a do-more-with-less era increasingly driven by human talent.<br \/><br \/>[&hellip;]<br \/><br \/>Spurred by Martin President Mike Hughes, Manpower at least considered a more radical rebranding but opted to retain a name that dates to the company&#8217;s founding in Milwaukee in 1948.<br \/><br \/>Joerres, whose background includes marketing positions, got involved in the effort much more so than the typical CEO and helped &#8220;make the work in the end so much smarter and better,&#8221; Hughes said.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jsonline.com\/business\/118884594.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Article on JSOnline<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/manpower_all_logos.gif\" alt=\"ManpowerGroup Logo, New\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Main ManpowerGroup logo and its four divisions.<\/p>\n<p>If this whole thing looks familiar that&#8217;s because the Manpower logo has been around since 2006 <a href=\"http:\/\/www.identityworks.com\/reviews\/2006\/manpower.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">when Wolff Olins redesigned their identity<\/a> &mdash; a very nice abstraction of &#8220;m&#8221; and &#8220;P&#8221; executed in the ever popular <a href=\"http:\/\/www.google.com\/search?client=safari&#038;rls=en&#038;q=sausage%20links&#038;oe=UTF-8&#038;um=1&#038;ie=UTF-8&#038;tbm=isch&#038;source=og&#038;sa=N&#038;hl=en&#038;tab=wi&#038;biw=1411&#038;bih=859\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sausage-link<\/a> style, which has now been extended to a whole family of logos. Where the original arranged the links in an interesting way to form an icon with actual meaning, the new parent logo is just a bland throwback to 1980s abstract corporate iconography. If it weren&#8217;t for the equity of the original Manpower logo, the new ManpowerGroup logo would be the absolute most generic thing a company could have. The new logos for Right Management and Experis are valiant efforts in extending the sausage-link language and they succeed a little bit better than the parent logo. For a major corporation this is a decent evolution and maybe as more applications, like the one below turn up, things will get a bit more exciting.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/manpower_sample.png\" alt=\"ManpowerGroup Logo, New\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">New brand language (from the company&#8217;s French Facebook page).
