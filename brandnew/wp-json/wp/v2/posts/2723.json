Since being purchased in 2009 by a husband and wife team, the bread-maker has tripled its business and is now ready to expand with this new name, identity, and packaging designed by Madison, WI-based <a href=\"http:\/\/shineunited.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Shine United<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>Meet Angelic Bakehouse. A name that reflects the purity of the ingredients used and processes applied when making every product. From a new logo and packaging to digital and social design, the entire brand presence is an honest manifestation of the product itself &mdash; wholesome and pure. And where the category is over-run with old-fashioned hearth and oven-related design, Shine took a fresh approach.<\/blockquote><h3>Provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/angelic_bakehouse_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Packaging for Angelic Bakehouse by Shine United\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/angelic_bakehouse_stationery.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Packaging for Angelic Bakehouse by Shine United\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stationery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/angelic_bakehouse_truck.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Packaging for Angelic Bakehouse by Shine United\" \/>\n<figcaption>Livery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The previous name and logo were definitely on the far side of the hippie axis when it comes to the aesthetics of health(ier) food with its drum-circle typography &mdash; I don&#8217;t even know what that means, but it felt good writing it. Anyway. The new logo and name are excellent and pair perfectly. The grain-stalk-winged &#8220;A&#8221; has a great, airy look to it and almost looks like a superhero emblem. The connection to angels and wings is clear but not annoyingly obvious. The typography in &#8220;ANGELIC&#8221; is clean, contemporary, and bold. I wish I could say the same for &#8220;BAKEHOUSE&#8221; but it seems another designer was in charge of that: the type selection is close enough to the one in the main name, yet it&#8217;s not. The &#8220;E&#8221;s are especially jarring. Nonetheless, it&#8217;s a strong logo. There is also a particular detail that I love about it: the meeting point of the grain stalks that serve as the crossbar of the &#8220;A&#8221; is the exact center of the full logo. <em>That<\/em> is so hot.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/angelic_bakehouse_old.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Packaging for Angelic Bakehouse by Shine United\" \/>\n<figcaption>Old packaging.

But I&#8217;ll just close with saying that that is one savory-looking set of bread bags. My favorite part is the band of logos on the opening of the bag. Overall, a great redesign obviously done with great care and attention to detail.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1969 as Cybros the Sprouted Bakehouse in Waukesha, WI, Angelic Bakehouse, as it was renamed this year, is self-credited as one of the first &quot;champions of sprouted grains&quot; offering a range of breads.
