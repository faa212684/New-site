The identity for the coverage was designed by London, UK-based <a href=\"http:\/\/dixonbaxi.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DixonBaxi<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>With a mission to inspire and engage a younger audience, DixonBaxi partnered with Eurosport to deliver its Games-time campaign, taking strong cultural cues from the South Korean location of the Games. Injecting a &#8216;K-pop&#8217; spirit of hyper-neon colours and vibrancy into the brand experience, they created a radically different cross-platform identity &#8211; the antithesis to the typical frost bitten white winter imagery &#8211; transforming the entire Eurosport brand into Games-mode over the fortnight of the games. As the first fully digital first Games across Europe, it demanded a suite of tools that would withstand the rigour of every mobile touchpoint. DixonBaxi crafted everything for Eurosport from social kits, to graphic systems designed for maximum mobile legibility.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/dixonbaxi.com\/work\/eurosport-pyeongchang-2018\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DixonBaxi project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/eurosport_pyeongchang_2018_logo.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and On-air Look for Eurosport Winter Olympics by DixonBaxi\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The logo represented a strategic alliance between Eurosport, the Olympics and PyeongChang 2018. A simple, graphic silhouetted mountain provided the visual metaphor to unite three logos into one iconic mark. The angular shapes in turn inform the broader visual identity of bold graphic slices that create a dramatic, infinitely flexible look across digital, studio set design, on-air and OOH advertising.<\/blockquote><h3>DixonBaxi provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/eurosport_pyeongchang_2018_logo_grid.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and On-air Look for Eurosport Winter Olympics by DixonBaxi\" \/>\n<figcaption>Angles.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/eurosport_pyeongchang_2018_logo_animation.gif\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and On-air Look for Eurosport Winter Olympics by DixonBaxi\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo animation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The logo includes the wordmark from the official PyeongChang 2018 Olympic Winter Games logo, topped by Eurosport&#8217;s logo, topped by one piece of original design in the form of a minimalist set of mountains knocked out of a circle. Nothing too exciting &#8212; certainly better than <a href=\"https:\/\/vignette.wikia.nocookie.net\/logopedia\/images\/5\/5b\/NBC_PyeongChang_2018.svg\/revision\/latest?cb=20161218205343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NBC&#8217;s rendition<\/a> &#8212; but since it&#8217;s a short-lived logo and its main goal is to communicate that this is about the Olympics on Eurosport in a quick, efficient way, this does the job quite well and establishes the bold, hard-angled aesthetic for the rest of the identity.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/eurosport_pyeongchang_2018_guidelines.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and On-air Look for Eurosport Winter Olympics by DixonBaxi\" \/>\n<figcaption>Guidelines.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The unique forms of the Korean written language &#8211; Hangul &#8211; provided fuel for the typography and pictograms. DixonBaxi commissioned <a href=\"https:\/\/www.a2-type.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A2Type<\/a> to cut a bespoke Hangul inspired font &#8216;ES Pyeongchang 2018&#8217;. With the typeface design established, they then used the forms as the foundation to crafting an exclusive suite of pictograms for every sport from Big Air to Curling. The pictograms and typeface beautifully complimented each other and delivered\u00a0a\u00a0distinct and iconic communication layer atop the fluid graphic system, infusing a Korean spirit into the brand experience.<\/blockquote><h3>DixonBaxi provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/eurosport_pyeongchang_2018_custom_font.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and On-air Look for Eurosport Winter Olympics by DixonBaxi\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/eurosport_pyeongchang_2018_custom_font_animated.gif\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and On-air Look for Eurosport Winter Olympics by DixonBaxi\" \/>\n<figcaption>Custom font.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The custom font looks good small or from afar when the half-square, half-rounded endings of the letters are less noticeable.
