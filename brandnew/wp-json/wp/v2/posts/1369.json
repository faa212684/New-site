The original companies were strong on their own: Sirius launched in 2001, made a big splash in 2004 when it lured Howard Stern away from earth-bound radio; and XM, also launched in 2001, attracted Oprah and her team of personalities in 2006. Operating with a very mergerish logo since the merger, a new logo had been spotted as early as November of last year and just this month the new SiriusXM logo appeared on their website.<\/p><!--more--><p>The Sirius logo is probably the better known of the two, thanks to its cute starry-eyed dog, whose unofficial nickname is Mongo. A good logo and one that came to represent the revolution of what radio could be back in the early &rsquo;00s. The logo for XM wasn&#8217;t bad, it had distinct typography and radio waves that matched. Combined as a merger it was horrible, but most merger logos are, so no surprise there. It&#8217;s interesting that in the new logo the waves from the XM logo survived but Mongo didn&#8217;t, perhaps he was too strong a character to reflect a combined company. The two old logos still make appearances here and there to work with legacy customers who may have pre-merger subscriptions or equipment, so it can create a slightly confusing universe of logos.<\/p>\n<p>The new logo is bland and clunky. The typography is as appetizing as a satellite radio network broadcasting music-free commercials. It&#8217;s bulky, lacks sophistication, and, for the life of me, I can&#8217;t understand why the &#8220;m&#8221; in &#8220;Xm&#8221; is lowercase but with an uppercase height. The waves themselves are fine (it&#8217;s hard to screw up waves) but in contrast to the type they have the same ratio as a spaghetti does to a meatball. For a company that represents such a strong model and broke conventions &mdash; who would want to pay for radio?! &mdash; this is far too stale.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to Roy Levitt for first tip (November 2010).<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_110228_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_110228_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"574\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,51,26],"tags":[292,480,42],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1369"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1369"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1369\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1369"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1369"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1369"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
