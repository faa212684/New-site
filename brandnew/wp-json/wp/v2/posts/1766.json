Among thousands of movies some notables are franchises like <em>The Godfather<\/em>, <em>Indiana Jones<\/em>, <em>The Naked Gun<\/em>, and <em>Mission: Impossible<\/em>. To celebrate their upcoming 100th anniversary in 2012, Paramount Pictures is introducing a revised logo to play at the beginning of its movies, designed by Santa Monica, CA-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.devastudios.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Devastudios<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>The studio&#8217;s first logo, a symbol of a rugged, snow-covered peak from the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wasatch_Range\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wasatch mountain range<\/a>, was created in 1916. The 100th Anniversary logo was created by Devastudios, Inc.<br \/><br \/>Paramount will use the logo throughout its centennial year in 2012. Beginning in 2013, the wordingabout the 100th anniversary will be removed from the logo, with the rest of the design remaining in use.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.paramount.com\/news\/press-releases\/paramount-pictures-unveils-new-logo-in-celebration-of-the-studio's-100th-anniversary\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press Release<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/paramount_logo_detail.jpg\" alt=\"Paramount Logo\" \/><\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"574\" height=\"322\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/WU8QbsKeOWM\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">A history of Paramount Pictures logos.<\/p>\n<p>Other than 20th Century Fox there is no studio opening logo animation more recognizable than Paramount and seeing its evolution over the years is a testament to its strength as a representation of the studio&#8217;s name and this poetic magical feeling we want to expect from a movie experience. The new logo remains almost exactly the same as the previous one, with the shape of the mountain&#8217;s peak untouched. What has changed is the framing shot of the mountain, allowing the viewer to see more of its context and make the focal mountain seem even bigger. Putting the sun behind it makes it more dramatic, which also makes the stars and typography appear dark, as opposed to white &mdash; a nice change. The new logo is perhaps a little more distracting as there are more elements, and more realistically rendered, than before but I think it&#8217;s a great evolution.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/behance.net\/ArmandoRoque\/frame\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Armando Roque<\/a> for first tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_111216_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_111216_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_111216_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_111216_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,66,26],"tags":[637,105],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1766"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1766"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1766\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1766"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1766"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1766"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
