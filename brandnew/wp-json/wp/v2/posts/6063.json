Designed by Johannesburg-based <a href=\"https:\/\/candicebondi.design\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Candice Bondi<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.shaunhill.co.za\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Shaun Hill<\/a>, the identity has a lo-fi street food vendor aesthetic with a tropical, tiki-like twist for a slightly chaotic but neatly controlled set of materials. Both the typography and illustration work are fresh and lively and the limited color palette of blue, yellow, and black makes it feel humble and endearing. Plus, there is a lamb wearing a fez. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/candicebondi.design\/baba-g-deli-branding\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Le Ballon by Yorgo &amp; Co.<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_leballon.gif\" alt=\"Le Ballon by Yorgo &amp; Co.\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.leballonfc.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Le Ballon<\/a> is a friendly (but competitive-looking) soccer league started in 2014 in Paris that, at the time, also had its own bar (which seems to not be the case at the moment). The identity for the league-slash-bar &#8212; dream brief for the many soccer-loving, beer-guzzling designers out there (you know who you are) &#8212; was designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/yorgo.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Yorgo &amp; Co.<\/a> and revolves around dizzying patterns that reveal a ball as the logo. It&#8217;s a cool twist on rendering the popular hexagons of soccer balls and lends itself to some crazy-looking applications that make it clear that this isn&#8217;t a stuffy soccer league or bar and that it doesn&#8217;t take itself too seriously. As a bonus for inclusion, if you are not a drinker, the   identity makes you feel like you had one too many and partake in the spirit (without fumbling home). <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/yorgo.co\/work_category_branding_visual-identity-145\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Shoot Studio by lg2<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_shoot.jpg\" alt=\"Shoot Studio by lg2\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.shootstudio.ca\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Shoot Studio<\/a> is a one-stop photo studio in Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec, that offers photo and video, production, postproduction, and studio rental. They also offer plenty of puns in their new identity by local firm <a href=\"https:\/\/lg2.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">lg2<\/a> that&#8217;s an all-black, all-<a href=\"https:\/\/www.grillitype.com\/typeface\/gt-haptik\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GT-Haptik<\/a> affair with big, bold typography. There isn&#8217;t anything truly novel here but it&#8217;s interesting how the word &#8220;shoot&#8221; looks so great big in white against black. Things might get a tad <em>too<\/em> playful in the further renderings (shown in the project page) but it clearly showcases that the studio has a sense of humor. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/58884411\/Shoot-Studio-lg2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Plenty of bold sans serifs this week, with work from Johannesburg, Paris, and Montr\u00e9al&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[36,11,85,26],"tags":[828,1107,168,400],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6063"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=6063"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6063\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=6063"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=6063"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=6063"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
