Combined with an extensive color palette, the dozens of potential icons allow Byte to give each bar their own look and keep the brand fresh.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/castirondesign.com\/work\/byte-bars\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cast Iron Design project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/byte_bars_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Byte Bars by Cast Iron Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/383120706?title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0&#038;autoplay=1&#038;loop=1&#038;autopause=0&#038;background=1&#038;muted=1\" width=\"360\" height=\"203\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Wordmark color animation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The wordmark, typeset in Oh No&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.futurefonts.xyz\/ohno\/cheee\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cheee<\/a>, which is described as a &#8220;high contrast blobber, designed to be used large, and for a slightly stoney vibe&#8221;, is exactly that: a slightly stoney vibe of a blobber that for some unknown reason fits perfectly a brand of healthy, feel-good snack bars made in Colorado. To some of youse&#8217;s disappointment, no, this do not contain cannabis despite all the visual hints that it would. The wordmark puts the <em>funky<\/em> in, well, <em>funky<\/em> and it&#8217;s really all kinds of loose fun.
