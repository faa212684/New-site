It offers apprenticeships, continuing education, and degrees in association with  the University of Sussex to over 8,000 students. Its school of art has yielded such  notable alumni as Jamie Reid (of Sex Pistols album cover fame), Malcolm McLaren (Sex Pistols manager), John Rocha (fashion designer), and (in brief enrollment) David Bowie. In October of last year, the Croydon School of Art relaunched as its own distinct institution within Croydon College. With a brief that &#8220;required an aspirational, contemporary solution that could successfully communicate their values, while echoing the school&#8217;s impressive heritage&#8221; as well as needing to &#8220;appeal to a young audience of prospective students, while being honest and true to its urban location,&#8221; the new identity was designed by London-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.blast.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Blast<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>Our solution &mdash; centred around a tear device &mdash; aims to reflect the School of Art past and present, acknowledging its credible heritage while moving confidently forward. The brand identity is influenced by past connections such as Op Art (Bridget Riley) and a punk\/situationist aesthetic (Malcolm McLaren \/ Jamie Reid), while positioning CSA at the contemporary cutting edge of modern art and design education.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.blast.co.uk\/croydon-school-of-art\/#\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Blast project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/croydon_school_of_art_logo_detail_anim.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Croydon School of Art by Blast\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo variations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>I really like this new logo. There is something very simple and raw about it that feels authentic yet still institutional. The tear in the &#8220;C&#8221; manages to avoid looking like your typical, cheap Adobe Illustrator effect and the main variation of the halftone pattern works perfectly with it. The flexible variations are also nicely done and they add even more texture to the identity. The wordmark is okay, perhaps a little too tightly set but, other than that, it stays out of the way.<\/p>\n<blockquote>The tear also suggests the creative process and allows the brand identity flexibility. Used creatively it can reveal colours or imagery, combining layers to create designs that are unexpected or relevant to particular courses, or aspects of college life. It also creates a dynamic urban identity in keeping with the College&#8217;s central Croydon location.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.blast.co.uk\/croydon-school-of-art\/#\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Blast project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/croydon_school_of_art_posters.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Croydon School of Art by Blast\" \/>\n<figcaption>Posters.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/croydon_school_of_art_stationery.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Croydon School of Art by Blast\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stationery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/croydon_school_of_art_signage.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Croydon School of Art by Blast\" \/>\n<figcaption>Signage.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/croydon_school_of_art_various.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Croydon School of Art by Blast\" \/>\n<figcaption>Various items.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/croydon_school_of_art_web.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Croydon School of Art by Blast\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/croydon_school_of_art_web_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Croydon School of Art by Blast\" \/>\n<figcaption>Website prototype.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">In application the identity feels decidedly urban, contemporary, and artistic without forcing itself to do so. At times the &#8220;C&#8221; in the bottom right corner seems repetitive with the logo on the upper left when there isn&#8217;t enough size difference between the two. Overall, this feels quite right for an urban-centered art school that has ties to the punk rock aesthetics of 1970s London.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1978 with the merger of the Croydon School of Art (est. 1868, simply as &quot;School of Art&quot;) and Croydon Polytechnic (est. 1888 as Pitlake Technical Institute), Croydon College is a higher education institution located in the outer London&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[29,12,26],"tags":[119,179,337,530],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3147"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3147"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3147\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3147"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3147"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3147"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
