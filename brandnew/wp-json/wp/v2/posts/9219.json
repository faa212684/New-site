It appears to be a modernization of older nineteenth-century gothics, although it has considerable resemblance to the much later European design, Helvetica Bold (1953).<br \/><br \/>It&#8217;s neutral yet solid feel was a perfect complement to the expression of the display wood-inspired typefaces by The Pyte Foundry, which are a nod to the rich history of wheatpaste posters that littered the walls of cities in the Nineteenth century.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/trabuc.co\/Irvington-Theater-Brand-Identity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A.A.

The new logo isn&#8217;t exciting by any means and as far as custom sans serif wordmarks go it&#8217;s not the best &#8212; it&#8217;s not the worst either, at all &#8212; but as the literal foundation for the identity system it does a solid job serving as a sturdy anchor. The custom type family the logo comes from is nice for sure and it does manage to capture the vintage-ness of the very early gothic sans serifs &#8212; the numerals in particular are deliciously clunky.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/444931353?title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"360\" height=\"203\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\r\n<figcaption>Custom type family by A.A.

The wood-inspired typography captures the vibrance of the varied cultural personalities passing through the Irvington Theater.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/trabuc.co\/Irvington-Theater-Brand-Identity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A.A.

It&#8217;s the kind of typographic-driven solution many designers dream of getting approved by a client &#8212; I, myself, have presented design solutions that use a couple dozen typefaces but to no avail &#8212; in part because of the simple joy of using and combining so many different typefaces but also because it&#8217;s an effective way of conveying diversity, variety, and range &#8212; in this case of programming. The approach is very nicely pulled off in this system by limiting the funky fonts to the titles of each event and sandwiching it between the pared-down custom sans serif. Keeping all the typography in black helps temper down the chaos while the wide color palette helps separate the multiple layers that create a nice  sense of depth not just visually but metaphorically in that the theater has a lot to offer throughout the season. On the flip side, it could be argued that the system overpowers the name of the theater and it could be difficult to see it after it&#8217;s buried under all those layers but the counter-argument is that, with time, the effect itself is what becomes recognizable as the theater&#8217;s main identifier.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"full\">\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/irvington_theater_strips.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Irvington Theater by A.A.
