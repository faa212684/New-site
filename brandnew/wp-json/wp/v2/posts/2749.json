For a brick factory. There was really nothing in it that, as an outsider, would have indicated that this is a department store with contemporary fashions and other products. The new logo is more within the scope of boutique hotels and the sort, so it&#8217;s not overly descriptive but at least it&#8217;s within the ballpark (or right arrondissement). Typeset in a very safe sans serif and spaced adequately, the new logo is pleasant and the orange slash becomes a very effective graphic device to build the identity around. In application, the diagonal lines are deployed with relative restraint and avoid becoming overpowering or distracting. I like how they have established two patterns: one &#8220;zoomed out&#8221; and one &#8220;zoomed in&#8221; of the lines, best appreciated in the wrenches above. It helps break the monotony of one pattern. Overall, it&#8217;s pretty and it&#8217;s contemporary without being overdone.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1856, the Bazar de l&#8217;H&ocirc;tel de Ville (BHV for short) is a popular department store in Paris located in the 4th arrondissement in the gallery-filled district of Marais.
