In an effort to become a major hotel chain in North America, &#8220;La Quinta plans to nearly double its network of 586 hotels by 2011, focusing on Canada, the Northeast, Florida, California, the Northwest, and the mid-Atlantic. Later this year, it will open its first property in Mexico.&#8221;<\/p><!--more--><p>The logo remembers its Texas roots, but incorporating a sun seems a little risky as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/let_the_sunshine_inn.php\">Days Inn, a competitor, is known for its sun<\/a>. Nonetheless, La Quinta&#8217;s logo has its own merits: The colors remain untouched from their prior logo and tie back to the Southwest &mdash; a bold move to help distinguish the brand. The typography is beautifully typeset, and doesn&#8217;t fall into the trap of &#8220;make it southwestern.&#8221; Their new mark should attract new clientele as well as be distinguishable in the new marketplaces. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hotel-online.com\/News\/PR2007_1st\/Mar07_LQBrand.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">For more information please read the press release<\/a>.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":15,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,73,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/495"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/15"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=495"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/495\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=495"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=495"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=495"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
