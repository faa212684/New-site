It all started on February 2009 when Kraft Foods Inc., the corporation, <em>not<\/em> Kraft, the consumer brand, redesigned its logo to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kraft_foods_smiling_at_you.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this<\/a> horrible thing. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kraft_foods_rearranging_the_pu.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Five months later<\/a> they flipped the starburst to the other side and changed the colors. Then, as reported <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/its_a_delez_monde_after_all.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a>, Kraft Foods Inc. had announced in August of 2011 that it would split its company in two: (1) Mondelez, for the global snacks business and now (2) <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kraftfoodsgroup.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kraft Foods Group<\/a> (<em>not<\/em> Kraft Foods Inc.) for the North American grocery business, managing brands like the eponymous Kraft as well as Maxwell House, Oscar Mayer, Planters, and JELL-O. As of October 1, 2012, Kraft Foods Group is officially a start-up or, as they describe it, a &#8220;new company that has been around 109 years&#8221; that also happens to have revenues of approximately $19 billion in 2011. A new logo was introduced with the new company. No design credit given.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>&#8220;Today is the beginning of a great new company, a totally new Kraft, one with the spirit of a startup and the soul of a powerhouse,&#8221; said Vernon.  &#8220;We are proud of our rich history and deeply passionate about Kraft&#8217;s future. We see this as an opportunity to build something extraordinary, to create a renaissance in the North American food &amp; beverage industry.&#8221;<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/ir.kraftfoodsgroup.com\/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=710705\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press Release<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kraft_2012_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"Kraft Food Group Logo\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kraft_2012_logo_old_vs_new.gif\" alt=\"Kraft Food Group Logo\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Old and new &#8220;race track&#8221; logos.<\/p>\n<p>Above all, it&#8217;s a pleasure to see the starburst logo be a casualty of the split. It was one of the worst corporate logos in recent years. The new corporate logo adopts a redesigned version of the well-known consumer logo found on the sides, fronts, and or\/backs of mayo and mac and cheese and other Kraft foodstuffs. I am assuming &mdash; more like hoping &mdash; that the new lowercase version of the corporate logo will also be used on the consumer level because otherwise it would be a disaster. Comparing the two &#8220;race track&#8221; logos, the change is evident, going from a minimally flared sans serif in uppercase to a Gotham-esque sans serif set in title case. The change is welcome. The new logo feels much softer and friendlier and, somehow, I feel like the type sits better inside that weird shape than the previous version. The holding shape has also been modified slightly, being like 5% taller. To complement the launch, Kraft Foods Group has been using a bold, stencil font (shown below) that has little to do with anything and I see no relevant reasoning to using it. But, what the hell, it&#8217;s fun to look at. What it does say, along with the logo, is that, as a corporation, Kraft is definitely trying to behave differently, more fun and loose, so it should be interesting to see how it keeps evolving.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kraft_2012_stencil_sample_01.jpg\" alt=\"Kraft Food Group Logo\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Tsk tsk on that &#8220;98%&#8221;.
