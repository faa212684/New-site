An artist rendering on those documents showed a new sign over the facade of the proposed store.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/walmart_store.jpg\" alt=\"Walmart Signage Rendering\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Artist rendering of the new signage. All I can say, though, is &#8220;Really? This is the best Walmart can do when it comes to renderings?&#8221; Oy.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>As a reason of why the logo change, the reports on newspapers all allude to Walmart&#8217;s continued evolution and progression from its less-than-glamorous reputation and image as an invasive retailer with less-than-desirable employment and environmental practices. And the evasive <a href=\"http:\/\/walmartstores.com\/FactsNews\/NewsRoom\/8411.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">press release<\/a> does little to explain anything:<\/p>\n<blockquote>But what really matters is what happens out there in the stores. This update to the logo is simply a reflection of the refresh taking place inside our stores and our renewed sense of purpose to help people save money so they can live better.<\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/walmart_detail.gif\" alt=\"Walmart Logo, Detail\" \/><\/p>\n<p>So with no reasoning or no explanation of what the new star burst stands for, or why the decision to change to a single word, all we have to go by is the logo that replaces the 16-year-old sans serif that was as thick and heavy as the beige boxes it adorned for so long. The new logo is rumored to have been designed by New York-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lippincott.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lippincott<\/a> &mdash; and I will happily amend this as soon as there is more information available. The change to title case helps humanize Walmart with a name that reads more like John, Albert, Sarah or Wilbur; it really looks very different and sets a different tone. The wordmark is nice and friendly and has enough customization to feel more proprietary than out-of-the-box. The new icon, however, is very questionable. It reflects technology start-up or telecommunications company before it does discount retailing that will make anyone live better. Sure, it might represent a flower or a sun, but the execution is too modern and cold to be seen as a natural element. <\/p>\n<p>The new store environment and applications of the logo will define how good this can be and if the whole package supports this initial tease. I remain skeptical yet optimistic, but not too much.
