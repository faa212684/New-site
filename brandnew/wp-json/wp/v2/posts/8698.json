The logo itself represents the idea of choices, flexing and shifting between options.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/design.studio\/work\/olx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DesignStudio project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/olx_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for OLX by DesignStudio\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/olx_logo_animation_02.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo animation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video controls controlsList=\"nodownload\" poster=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/olx_logo_behaviors.jpg\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/olx_logo_behaviors.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo behaviors.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo was mostly fine*. Other than the strange color combination &#8212; which is not wrong per se, it&#8217;s just weird &#8212; it was clear and bouncy and treated the &#8220;LX&#8221; pair in a way that solved what would have been some unbalanced counterspace issues. Perhaps it did feel a little dated but could have easily stayed the same for a long time. The new logo is a more abstract representation with a hard geometric approach that turns the logo from an easy read to a complicated one and it&#8217;s only three letters. If I were seeing this logo for the first time, without knowing the name of the company, I would read it as &#8220;O|X&#8221; but under the assumption that most people will read it as &#8220;OLX&#8221; or &#8220;olx&#8221; there is something not quite right about the logo. The &#8220;O&#8221; is too big, the &#8220;L&#8221; too thick, and the &#8220;X&#8221; too small. The strange thing for me, is that I don&#8217;t dislike it&#8230; there is something strong about it and I really like how the premise of the brand position comes alive in the basic logo animation, where the letters shift weights and sizes to give the idea of choices and variety and how that extends to the typographic treatments.<\/p>\n<p><strong>* Update:<\/strong> I previously included <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/olx_logo_before_after_a.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the wrong &#8220;before&#8221; logo<\/a>, which was only used in Brazil. This correct version is a little worse with its more exuberant &#8220;X&#8221; and tight stroke around the logo. <\/p>\n<blockquote>We created all the tools OLX would need to launch the refreshed brand around the world &#8212; including distinctive custom typography, a vibrant colour palette, photography guidelines featuring confident local users, and helpful yet attitudinal tone of voice principles.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/design.studio\/work\/olx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DesignStudio project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\" style=\"padding-bottom: 67.25%;\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/olx_typography.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Typography treatment.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>This is probably the better part of the identity presentation because for as much potential as the above animation has, that same energy or cohesiveness doesn&#8217;t quite come across in application.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\" style=\"padding-bottom:100%\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/olx_Layout_Generator.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Layout generator.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/olx_ad_print.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for OLX by DesignStudio\" \/>\n<figcaption>Print ad.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/olx_ad.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for OLX by DesignStudio\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/olx_ad_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for OLX by DesignStudio\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/olx_posters.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for OLX by DesignStudio\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/olx_ad_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for OLX by DesignStudio\" \/>\n<figcaption>Out of home advertising.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>From seeing any of these posters and ads, I would have no idea what this brand is about or what it does or who it&#8217;s for. The messaging is unclear and ambiguous and while they try to be aspirational in some form I am really not sure what I&#8217;m supposed to be aspiring to. There is also a big emphasis on the &#8220;O&#8221; and the &#8220;X&#8221;, leaving the &#8220;L&#8221; out of the equation, further making the logo read as &#8220;O|X&#8221;.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/olx_notebooks.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for OLX by DesignStudio\" \/>\n<figcaption>Notebooks.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/olx_instagram_posts.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for OLX by DesignStudio\" \/>\n<figcaption>Instagram posts.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The two images above are cool, I guess.

I feel like there was a good start somewhere in here and the logo could be good with some better hints of what it&#8217;s supposed to read like but somewhere it took the scenic detour instead of just going straight.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 2006, OLX (short for On Line eXchange) is a leading classifieds platform that allows users to buy, sell, or exchange used goods and services.
