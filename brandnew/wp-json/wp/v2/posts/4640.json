The event lasts for three weeks, spanning multiple venues across the city, attracting over 600,000 national and international visitors who, this year, will get to see work from 83 artists from 35 countries. The identity for this year&#8217;s event, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.biennaleofsydney.com.au\/20bos\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">20th Biennale of Sydney<\/a>, has been designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/forthepeople.agency\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">For the People<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>The 3 month event takes place across Sydney in 7 key locations including a museum, a state gallery, a railway station, an island, and a multitude of in-between spaces where the virtual and the physical worlds overlap. Positioned as &#8217;embassies of thought&#8217;, these unique locations are individually curated around clusters of ideas. These are the Embassy of the Real, Spirits, Disappearance, Non-Participation, Translation, Transition and Stanislaw Lem.<br \/><br \/>With such a complex and futuristic theme, spread across a host of locations, the key challenge was to connect the different venues and sub-themes, while also building awareness and connecting audiences to the diverse array of art and experiences. The identity explores the larger theme and the idea of embassies, to create individual iterations of the larger identity. Each embassy has its own typographic language and lettering forms, colour palette, and stylised delegate entities, developed in direct response to the clustering of ideas within. Each embassy is represented as a section within a continuous reel of information, conveying a fraction of the total experience and the distribution of art and ideas throughout the city. As we move from one venue to the next, their individual identities begin to converge and assimilate each other&#8217;s characteristics &#8211; merging in a dialogue of cultural exchange within the in-between spaces.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/35442537\/20th-Biennale-of-Sydney\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">For the People project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/20th_biennale_of_sydney_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 20th Biennale of Sydney by For the People\" \/>\n<figcaption>Full logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Neither the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.biennaleofsydney.com.au\/19bos\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">19th<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.utsarchitecture.net\/index.php\/featured\/2012\/18th-biennale-of-sydney-all-our-relations-symposium-at-art-gallery-of-nsw-speakers-include-anthony-burke-and-lawrence-wallen\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">18th<\/a> Biennale identities were too exciting but the 17th, designed by Jonathan Barnbrook, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.creativereview.co.uk\/cr-blog\/2010\/may\/17th-biennale-of-sydney-identity\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">kicked ass<\/a> so it&#8217;s nice to see the event go back to something more interesting and perhaps more head-scratching like some contemporary art. The main logo for the event is typeset in one of seven custom typefaces designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mathieureguer.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mathieu Reguer<\/a> and on its own is intriguing enough but only begins to scratch the surface.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/20th_biennale_of_sydney_tagline.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 20th Biennale of Sydney by For the People\" \/>\n<figcaption>Tagline.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/20th_biennale_of_sydney_embassies.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 20th Biennale of Sydney by For the People\" \/>\n<figcaption>The seven &#8220;Embassies&#8221; (which are the seven different locations where the biennale takes place).<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The main concept, if you happened to skip the quoted text is that each of the seven main locations for the Biennale has been dubbed an &#8220;Embassy&#8221;, where each is curated in a specific way, so each has gotten a custom typeface inspired by its lofty name. Some are kind of literal, like &#8220;Disappearance&#8221; and &#8220;Transition&#8221; and others, like &#8220;Spirit&#8221;, are less but they are all equally interesting.

At times it feels like too much of a visual onslaught amidst the already busy environment of Sydney but it matches the intensity of the festival itself. There are a ton more images on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/35442537\/20th-Biennale-of-Sydney\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the project page<\/a> if you feel like the ton of images in this post don&#8217;t get the point across. Overall, it&#8217;s cool to see something go off the rails (with restraint) in concept and execution and the Biennale was the perfect conduit for this identity.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1973 and celebrated every two years since, the Biennale of Sydney is the largest contemporary visual arts festival in Australia.
