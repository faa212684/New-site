Seriously I would. But, alas, <a href=\"http:\/\/hub.guitarhero.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Guitar Hero<\/a>, or its competitor Rock Band, are two or three generations removed from my free time. Now, instead of being excited about a video game release and getting in line at the crack of dawn, I&#8217;m giddy about its logo. Pentagram partner Michael Bierut, designers Joe Marianek and Kai Salmela, along with a cadre of image-makers <a href=\"http:\/\/pentagram.com\/en\/new\/2009\/09\/new-work-guitar-hero-1.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">have revamped Guitar Hero to rockin&#8217; heights<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/guitar_hero_packaging.jpg\" alt=\"Guitar Hero\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Guitar Hero 5 packaging.<\/p>\n<p>Disclosure: Yes, I worked for Michael and yes, Joe, Kai and I shared working bays and, yes, there are conflicts of interest at stake so the upcoming praise may be questionable. Whatever. When colleagues and ex-bosses do good work, there is no shame in recognizing it. Plus, we can get some additional images that haven&#8217;t popped up anywhere else.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/guitar_hero_logo_family.gif\" alt=\"Guitar Hero\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/guitar_hero_5_logo.gif\" alt=\"Guitar Hero\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">The family of Hero logos.<\/p>\n<p>If you are unfamiliar with Guitar Hero, the premise is fairly simple: Introduced by Activision in 2005, Guitar Hero gives gamers the opportunity to match songs note-by-note using a kooky guitar with buttons. Over the years, Guitar Hero has grown into a million-copy-selling, billion-dollar enterprise and has spawned versions featuring high profile acts like Metallica and Aerosmith &mdash; although neither a coup as big as its competitor&#8217;s, Rock Band, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thebeatlesrockband.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">partnership with the digitally-averse Beatles<\/a>. On September 1, Guitar Hero 5 was released and by the end of the year two spin-offs, Band Hero and DJ Hero will hit shelves as well. To help usher in a new era of cross-platform and multiple media applications, Pentagram has introduced a cohesive identity that retains the thrashing attitude of its predecessors.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/guitar_hero_celebrities.jpg\" alt=\"Guitar Hero\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">B- and C-list celebrities at the launch of DJ Hero at the Wiltern Theatre on June 1, 2009 in Los Angeles, California.<\/p>\n<p>Guitar Hero purists might argue there is nothing wrong with the old logo and, in essence, there isn&#8217;t: It&#8217;s spiky and it&#8217;s spelled correctly. But if you look at the details, the lettering in the old logo was all over the place, with big and fat &#8220;G&#8221;, &#8220;H&#8221; and &#8220;O&#8221;, a diminutive &#8220;I&#8221; and a range of other weights and widths. The gear-like precision with which the letters came together was interesting, but when scaled down it just became messy.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/guitar_hero_typography.jpg\" alt=\"Guitar Hero\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">A custom alphabet, Hero, by Kai and some executions with Joe.<\/p>\n<p>The new lettering preserves its spikiness and now has more room to breathe without sacrificing the hardcore feel. The letters are evenly weighed and the interaction between the counterforms of the letters <em>and<\/em> the words is quite energetic. As a black-and-white work, this is strong enough, but where the solid and smart structure of the logos really shines is in their proficiency to take on a multitude of hard rockin&#8217; effects and Pentagram worked with some of the best in the business &mdash; Rick Valicenti, Adam Larson and Steve Wilson &mdash; to bring the identity to life and show how it can be implemented in a variety of ways while using the same backbone.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/guitar_hero_hell.jpg\" alt=\"Guitar Hero\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/guitar_hero_molten.jpg\" alt=\"Guitar Hero\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/guitar_hero_electrocuted.jpg\" alt=\"Guitar Hero\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Guitar Hero imagery by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.3st.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rick Valicenti\/3st<\/a>. <a href=\"http:\/\/happenings.3st.com\/2009\/09\/new-collaboration-guitar-hero\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Additional explorations by 3st<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/dj_hero_laser.jpg\" alt=\"Guitar Hero\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/dj_hero_boogie.jpg\" alt=\"Guitar Hero\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/dj_hero_gold.jpg\" alt=\"Guitar Hero\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">DJ Hero imagery by <a href=\"http:\/\/wilson2000.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Steve Wilson<\/a> (first two) and Rick Valicenti\/3st (above).<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/band_hero_space.jpg\" alt=\"Guitar Hero\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/band_hero_glitz.jpg\" alt=\"Guitar Hero\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/band_hero_metal.jpg\" alt=\"Guitar Hero\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Band Hero imagery by <a href=\"http:\/\/adamncompany.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Adam Larson\/Adam + Company<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>I doubt I&#8217;m letting my personal allegiances sway me, because as a has-been gamer and once-mullet-toting heavy metal enthusiast I had an immediate, pleasurable gut reaction to the whole scope of this identity.
