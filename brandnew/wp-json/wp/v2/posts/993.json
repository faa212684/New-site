But it all comes down to this: The Best and Worst. I have gone through all the archives and selected the top 12 in each category. There were some dead-ringers for each category and some that required a little more self-deliberation acknowledging that some identities were left off the list. And just as well, I know my selections may incite some disagreements, which are more than welcome as we bring this year to a close. Each identity comes with some basic details like release date and design credits,  highlights from our polls for those identities that came after July when we introduced the feature, and I have selected one or two reader comments to accompany a brief summary from me. Enjoy! Brand New will take a break for the rest of the year, we may post one or two things, but set your expectations low for this Holiday season.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/2009_worst.gif\" alt=\"The Best and Worst of 2009, Brand New\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/2009_worst_12_yalepress.gif\" alt=\"The Best and Worst of 2009, Brand New\" \/><\/p>\n<h1><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/rand_rolls_off_the_press.php\">Yale University Press<\/a><\/strong><\/h1>\n<h4>Designed by: Matthew Carter (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yale.edu\/universityprinter\/typeface\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Yale Typeface<\/a>)<\/h4>\n<br \/>\n<h4>Release Date: September, 2009<\/h4>\n<br \/>\n<h4>Voting Highlight: 12% (152 of 1,194) Hate Paul Rand&#8217;s logo<\/h4>\n<p>To be perfectly fair, there is nothing formally wrong with the new logo, as it&#8217;s simply the word Yale typeset in the masterful work of Matthew Carter.

I just know it can be difficult to imagine all the possibilities when you work so closely with a brand. I used to work in-house for a public library in need of re-branding, but I don&#8217;t think I would&#8217;ve been the right person for the job.

It&#8217;s not the nostalgic splat anymore but it&#8217;s not your attention they are after, so better deal with it. Like Syfy &mdash; perhaps even in a stylistic trend &mdash; this is a bold, simple wordmark that can carry Nickelodeon for another quarter of a century.<\/p>\n<blockquote>It is really hard to say that without being influenced by my own childhood memories, but I think the old one looks awfully dated. It reminds me of late 80s and early 90s stuff, a world and a visual language that obviously doesn&#8217;t say much to the kids today.<br \/>&mdash; Pedro<br \/><br \/>I will definitely miss the splat logo, but this new one makes sense because Nick has had about a decade of slow reinvention. It&#8217;s definitely not what it was before, with bizarre shows like Ren &#038; Stimpy and Ahh! Real Monsters. It&#8217;s &#8220;trendy&#8221; now and has to appeal to several different audiences. I think this new wordmark achieves that without offending too many people.<br \/>&mdash; Ainsley<\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/2009_best_02_melbourne.jpg\" alt=\"The Best and Worst of 2009, Brand New\" \/><\/p>\n<h1><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pieces_of_melbourne.php\">City of Melbourne<\/a><\/strong><\/h1>\n<h4>Designed by: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.landor.com\/index.cfm?do=aboutus.sydney&#038;bhcp=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Landor (Sydney)<\/a><\/h4>\n<br \/>\n<h4>Release Date: July, 2009<\/h4>\n<br \/>\n<h4>Voting Highlight: 67% (1,020 of 1,520) Thought this was Way Cool<\/h4>\n<p>This new identity gained early praise when we first announced it, and then we got a chance to see <a href=\"http:\/\/level11.tumblr.com\/post\/177820498\/city-of-melbourne-identity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">all the different &#8220;M&#8221;s<\/a> and it became even cooler.

I agree, AOL is neither technically nor aesthetically the best logo or identity of the year. But no identity will have a bigger impact in the evolution of a brand as AOL&#8217;s. Most companies brand to match their audience, AOL is branding to create a new audience. The name may conjure the 1990s but the identity is twenty-first century all the way. Wolff Olins may be the punchline for many designers but, even if you don&#8217;t know it or care to admit it, they are having the last laugh.<\/p>\n<blockquote>Geez, does Wolff Olins have some sort of magic pixie dust that they sprinkle in their client&#8217;s lattes to get them to buy off on their concepts? Most of them seem very disjointed and lazy in my opinion.<br \/>&mdash; Rico<br \/><br \/>Seems like another entry in the recent spat of brands whose logos rely on some bizarrely assorted array of images to convey and carry their brand instead of the actual logo itself. It&#8217;s shit. And I don&#8217;t get why it&#8217;s now a word, like many others here. How could that possibly strengthen anything? There&#8217;s no combination of sounds you can make from reading those three letters with the punctuation that is even remotely attractive, memorable, positive, or, at the very least, has anything to do with the online world.<br \/>&mdash; Cory<br \/><br \/>To be sure, mutable wordmarks (visual play, around consistent letterforms) can be fun. Certainly, MTV and Nickelodeon showed you can get away with it on television, and Google has shown it can work on the Web. But are these particular &#8220;Aol.&#8221; letterforms a strong-enough visual anchor? Not clearly. Verbally, they are still a hole in the hull. And are we now expected to write not AOL but Aol? (I refuse to add the period, in text.) And thus to speak it as a-awl, or a-owl? The punctuation of the logo introduces uncertainty of the name in text applications&hellip; which is not a good a way to build a stronger brand.<br \/>&mdash; Tony Spaeth<\/blockquote>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[1],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/993"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=993"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/993\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=993"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=993"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=993"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
