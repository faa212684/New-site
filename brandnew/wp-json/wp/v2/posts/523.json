It&#8217;s like a divorce on steroids times hundreds of millions of dollars. The latest case, as you may have heard, was the separation of DaimlerChrysler, formed in 1998, as Chrysler Holding LLC in the U.S. and Daimler AG as its German counterpart. &mdash;  nicely down the middle, just like any good settlement. Chrysler, now blatantly dubbed &#8220;<em>New<\/em> Chrysler&#8221; (<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/New_Coke\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">New Coke<\/a> anyone?), has revived its <em>old<\/em> logo, the &#8220;Pentastar&#8221;, for the new chapter in this company&#8217;s life.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/chrysler_pentastars.gif\" alt=\"Chrysler, Old Pentastars\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Pentastars, variations on a theme<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The Pentastar (a pentagon, broken up as a star) was originally designed by Lippincott &amp; Margulies (now Lippincott Mercer) in 1962 and has, despite the merger, been a part of the company for more than 40 years.

Most recently as a blink-and-you-will-miss-it detail in the last Chrysler logo, which was used mostly as the hood ornament on Chrysler vehicles. And like other automobile companies, Chrysler has adopted the tradition of translating, literally, a physical object as a corporate identity mark and, in this case, it has taken it to monolithic levels&hellip; Just look at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.chryslerllc.com\/aboutus\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this animation<\/a>; the only thing missing is <em>2001<\/em>&#8216;s theme song.<\/p>\n<blockquote>The original Pentastar had five triangles which floated independently in a pentagon shape, broken by a five-pointed star in the middle.<br \/><br \/>\nThe new Pentastar, with some changes by Trevor Creed, Senior Vice President &mdash; Design, conveys strength and precision by fusing the ends of the five triangles to enclose the star and complete the pentagon.<\/blockquote>\n<p>You say tomayto I say tomahto. It&#8217;s still a star in a pentagon with massive dimensionalization regardless of how much reverse psychology you use. However, after experiencing now more than three years of this new method of &#8220;identity improvement,&#8221; I&#8217;m not as easily startled anymore by it, and I was actually surprised to read Tony Spaeth&#8217;s finger-waving comment: &#8220;I have seldom seen so graphic an expression of how far we have fallen, in 45 years, from the skill and confidence of modern design.&#8221; I&#8217;ve definitely seen worse. *cough* ups *cough*.<\/p>\n<p>Chrysler did the right thing in drawing from the equity it had in its Pentastar and it acted how most organizations do: by doing what others in the marketplace have already done. And in the automobile industry that means metalizing your logo. And to some, this may be cause for irreconcilable differences.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/chrysler_detail.gif\" alt=\"Chrysler Logo, Pentastar Detail\" \/><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[59,9,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/523"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=523"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/523\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=523"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=523"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=523"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
