The University of California has <a href=\"http:\/\/www.universityofcalifornia.edu\/news\/article\/28817\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">issued a press release<\/a> confirming that they have revoked their new logo.<\/p>\n<blockquote>This controversy has created a major distraction for the UCOP External Relations Division as it pursues its broader mission: communicating to all Californians the vital contributions UC makes to the quality of their lives and the prosperity of the state.<br \/><br \/>The controversy has been fueled in large part by an unfortunate and false narrative, which framed the matter as an either-or choice between a venerated UC seal and a newly designed monogram.<br \/><br \/>Therefore, I have instructed the communications team to suspend further use of the monogram. For certain applications, this process could require a measure of time to complete. In due course, we will re-evaluate this element of the visual identity system.<br \/>&mdash; Daniel M.

By next week you&#8217;ll have forgotten about even signing the petition but, in the course of that, you have caused irremediable damage in the confidence of the leadership team at UC to even consider doing anything new or different anytime soon that would potentially help improve your university system to succeed.
