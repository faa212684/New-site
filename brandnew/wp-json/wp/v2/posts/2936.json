So: Established in 2002, <a href=\"http:\/\/welcometocreature.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Creature<\/a> is a creative agency focusing on both design and advertising with offices in Seattle, WA, and London and they do rather nice work &mdash; we&#8217;ve previously covered their work for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/happy_district.php#.UtPOOmRDvfY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">District<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/happy_district.php#.UtPOOmRDvfY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Seattle&#8217;s Best Coffee<\/a>, and their <a href=\"http:\/\/underconsideration.com\/brandnewawards\/online\/2011\/sofa-kings-cycling-club-by-creature\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sofa Kings<\/a> project was included in the 2011 Brand New Awards. Earlier this month, Creature introduced a new identity for themselves.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>[While] the rest of the world wants to get rid of problems, Creature wants to collect them and shape them into beautiful creative solutions. When it came time for a refreshed brand identity, the agency wanted to bring this concept to life. The new design presents Creature as a premier destination where business problems are transformed into Beautiful Problems.<\/blockquote><h3>Provided press release<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/creature_icon.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity by and for Creature\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icon.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>&#8220;We pulled visual inspiration from the idyllic hospitality world, then smashed and warped those elements to reflect our experimental, non-linear process.&#8221; Says Creature Design Director Clara Mulligan.<br \/><br \/>The refresh includes smeared typography, ethereal horizon lines, glitched-out logos, warm, bright colors and a signature with the words &#8220;Courtesy, Quality and Questions.&#8221; A custom paradiseesque sunrise and sunset was in order, so the agency made their own by creating an average of sunrises and sunsets from over 100 of the world&#8217;s most incredible destinations. A bright reminder to continually seek creative possibility and newness.<\/blockquote><h3>Provided press release<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/creature_stationery.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity by and for Creature\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stationery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/creature_business_card.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity by and for Creature\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business card.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/creature_letterhead.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity by and for Creature\" \/>\n<figcaption>Letterhead.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>At first glance you might easily be going &#8220;WTF?&#8221; What design firm in their right mind would purposely have an identity that literally looks like a mistake, files gone corrupt on their way to press or haywire when uploaded online? Without the glitch and distort effect, this would be a perfectly nice identity with a handsome serif typeface, some hip supporting fonts, a soft color palette, and a nice range of applications. But then it would be just like any other design firm with a handsome serif typeface, some hip supporting fonts, a soft color palette, and a nice range of applications. Something a lot of us can do. I&#8217;m not saying we are doing it wrong or that this is the right way to brand a design firm but it IS an attention-grabbing way of doing it and there is something interesting about willingly coming across as imperfect.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/creature_postcards.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity by and for Creature\" \/>\n<figcaption>Postcards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/creature_seal_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity by and for Creature\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/creature_seal_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity by and for Creature\" \/>\n<figcaption>Seal.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">Once you get past the first impression, the identity is quite solid with a very serious consistency to it. The average of 100 sunsets makes for a great graphic and it looks specially appealing on the back of the letterhead and pairs really well with the main dark, muted blue color. It&#8217;s not an easy identity to accept as good (perhaps it even isn&#8217;t) but I do think there is a good amount of merit for attempting a new way of branding a design firm &mdash; a task that consistently yields remarkably conservative results.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"We are starting the week with a bit of a discrepancy in that I rarely do reviews of design firm&apos;s identities but you know I only deviate from my own rules when the subject matter calls for it.
