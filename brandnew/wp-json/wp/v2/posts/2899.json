Backed by Intel, Qualcomm, and Samsung among other tech giants, A4WP is an independently operated, not-for-profit organization that is pushing a notebook-sized pad (that can also be embedded in surfaces) that uses magnetic resonance to wirelessly charge smartphones and tablets. Last week, A4WP introduced the &#8220;consumer-facing brand that will act as the official name for the organization&#8217;s wireless power technology&#8221;: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rezence.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rezence<\/a>, designed by London-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.someoneinlondon.com\/category\/projects\/changing-the-power-struggle-rezence\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SomeOne<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/UVFxXScCEkk\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>How Rezence works. (Still with the old look).<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The name Rezence was derived from the words resonance and essence, communicating both the underlying technology and its ability to charge all types of electronic devices. The Rezence logo includes a simple, iconic mark in the form of a Z that can also be used as a standalone mark on a variety of applications.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.rezence.com\/media\/news\/alliance-wireless-power-unveils-rezence%E2%84%A2-brand\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rezence press release<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/rezence_00_concept.png\" alt=\"New Logo for Rezence by SomeOne\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo concept.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/rezence_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo for Rezence by SomeOne\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/rezence_icon.png\" alt=\"New Logo for Rezence by SomeOne\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icon detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/rezence_icon_goal.png\" alt=\"New Logo for Rezence by SomeOne\" \/>\n<figcaption>The goal of the icon is to become as recognizable as Bluetooth or Wi-Fi.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/rezence_01_charge_here.png\" alt=\"New Logo for Rezence by SomeOne\" \/>\n<figcaption>Charging device area.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/rezence_02_charging_inside.png\" alt=\"New Logo for Rezence by SomeOne\" \/>\n<figcaption>Just like the Wi-Fi Zone logos, establishments could promote wireless charging inside.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/rezence_03_outdoor_ad.png\" alt=\"New Logo for Rezence by SomeOne\" \/>\n<figcaption>Outdoor ad prototype.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">It&#8217;s an ambitious goal to create something as broadly-recognized as the Bluetooth or Wi-Fi icons but the Rezence logo has the same qualities that make those two so easy to identify: it&#8217;s minimal and it communicates quickly what it does. The lightning bolt has become shorthand for charging (at least to iPhone and iPad operators; not sure what happens in those other phones or tablets) and Rezence is smartly using it to its advantage. The &#8220;Z&#8221; shape even starts to look like a battery. It&#8217;s not a &#8220;pretty&#8221; or &#8220;creative&#8221; logo and it shouldn&#8217;t be. It&#8217;s something that you should be able to see from a distance and know that you can charge your device there (although you have to wonder about the safety of your untethered devices in a public place). This is a very successful, tiny piece of communication. Nonetheless, its ubiquity depends not in its execution but on whether Rezence becomes the standard used by all products and expected by all consumers.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 2012, the Alliance for Wireless Power (A4WP) is one of three or four organizations gunning for setting the standard protocol for the wireless charging of devices.
