Toronto-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.blokdesign.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Blok<\/a> created a sophisticated yet slightly off-kilter identity for them, with an almost fashion-label-like &#8220;L21&#8221; monogram and a wild range of patterns that visualize concepts like &#8220;voracious&#8221;, &#8220;fixated&#8221;, &#8220;maniacal&#8221;, and more. It&#8217;s not completely obvious what any of it is upon first glance but it&#8217;s certainly eye-catching. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.blokdesign.com\/#client\/lucky21\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Wearetheshit by Miki Stefanoski and Anastazija Manasievska<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_wats.jpg\" alt=\"Fazer Caf&eacute; by Kokoro &amp; Moi\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">I will be upfront about this and state that this is not necessarily &#8220;great&#8221; design but damn if it doesn&#8217;t make me happy that somebody has gone to there. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wearetheshit.tv\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wearetheshit<\/a> (or Wats) is a 500-square-feet (150-squared-meters) lounge bar and night club in Belgrade full of attitude. And shit. Adopting the slang for being awesome &mdash; as in &#8220;We are the shit because we all read a blog about logos every fucking day&#8221; &mdash; the identity makes no apologies for its name and uses a mint-colored dollop of poop as its logo, along with a handful of shit-based rebuses. (Wow, I never thought I would say &#8220;shit-based rebuses&#8221; in a critique). Designed by Skopje, Macedonia-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/mikistefanoski\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Miki Stefanoski<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/manasievska\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Anastazija Manasievska<\/a>, the identity is humorous, night-club-ish, and Eastern European-ish. In the project page there is a bunch of other more trendy, abstract-shape-based stuff that looks good but it&#8217;s not so much the shit. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/14390519\/Wearetheshit-\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project here<\/strong><\/a><\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Natasha Cantwell by Christopher Doyle &amp; Co.<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_cantwell.jpg\" alt=\"Wearetheshit by Miki Stefanoski and Anastazija Manasievska\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">For well-known, New Zealand photographer <a href=\"http:\/\/www.natashacantwell.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Natasha Cantwell<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/christopherdoyle.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Christopher Doyle &amp; Co.<\/a> used her last name for a humorous, verbal identity.
