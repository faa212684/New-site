How so? You could look at it as a recruiting and\/or networking opportunity to attract great talent; as a way to raise your profile in the industry, which can be a heavily populated industry; as a way to find copywriters, illustrators, marketing specialists, and art and creative directors to collaborate with; or, perhaps, simply as a way to connect with others in the industry. The audience of the Brand New Conference is pretty fantastic and we&#8217;ve heard some wonderful stories of designers who found jobs and even clients who found designers at the event, so it&#8217;s a really great opportunity to interact with passionate and talented folk.<\/p>\n<p>If this sounds interesting, <a href=\"mailto:armin@underconsideration.com\">send me an e-mail<\/a> and I can share a sponsorship package with details and benefits.
