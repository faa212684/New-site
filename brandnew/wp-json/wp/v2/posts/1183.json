Beyond its programming, Discovery Kids has also grown into a successful product brand, selling <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26search-alias%3Dtoys-and-games%26ref_%3Dbl_sr_toys-and-games%26field-brandtextbin%3DDiscovery&amp;tag=uc-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">everything<\/a> from little plastic dinosaurs to night goggles. This merchandising extension is important to note as on October of this year, Discovery Kids, the channel, will be replaced by The Hub, a collaboration between Discovery Communications and toy maker Hasbro. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/new_kid_channel_looks_like_not_much_fun.php\">We covered that logo in February<\/a>. So the new identity, created by Irvine, California-based <a href=\"http:\/\/mattsoncreative.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mattson Creative<\/a>, is now a consumer product brand and not just a channel identifier.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/discovery_kids_2_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"Discovery Kids\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Unlike the rest of the Discovery Communications channels, which all have their own unique logos, Discovery Kids has always followed in the footsteps of its grown up Discovery Channel, and this version is no exception. Except that, unlike the last one, this is really well done. Using the same structure <a href=\"http:\/\/corporate.discovery.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">as the parent brand<\/a> and the flagship channel, the Discovery Kids logo does the very simple maneuver of redrawing the globe in chunky-marker-style. Drawing logos as if they were done by kids is an old trick, but they invariably look cloying. This globe rather than following the by-kids-for-kids drawing is by-adults-for-kids, giving it a more professional finish. Probably this is just a long-winded way of saying, I like it. The bold &#8220;KIDS&#8221; typography is well integrated too. It&#8217;s big but not too big, it&#8217;s in the right place and it matches one of the blues in the logo. Simple, obvious things but worth noting as many logos we see here fail to do them.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/discovery_kids_2_pack.jpg\" alt=\"Discovery Kids\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/discovery_kids_2_style_01.jpg\" alt=\"Discovery Kids\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/discovery_kids_2_style_02.jpg\" alt=\"Discovery Kids\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The simplicity and directness of the logo, though, is lost in the packaging, which reverts to an odd 1990s Nickelodeon look that doesn&#8217;t have the same kind of sophistication of the logo. Granted a logo doesn&#8217;t move products, packaging does and, in that regard, this just kind of screams off the shelf.
