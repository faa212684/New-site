Spanning over 1,900 products, the brand brings in $1 billion or more in annual sales, despite its lackluster look. After some market research &#8212; for a lifetime supply of marshmallows I could have told them the same thing &#8212; Target decided to revitalize Market Pantry through its in-house design group, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.targetcreativestudio.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Target Creative<\/a>, and partnering with the New York office of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pearlfisher.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pearlfisher<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>&#8220;Turns out, guests loved Market Pantry&#8217;s great taste, quality and low prices, but they thought the packaging designs fell a little flat,&#8221; says Amanda Irish, vice president merchandise manager, Owned Brands. &#8220;Target&#8217;s known for great design, but the current, generic look and feel of Market Pantry just wasn&#8217;t reflecting that.&#8221;<br \/><br \/>Words like &#8220;basic,&#8221; &#8220;generic&#8221; and &#8220;plain jane&#8221; came up when guests described the current designs.<br \/><br \/>Ultimately, the team decided on a bolder, more joyful look for the new packaging. They incorporated bright colors against a consistent red and white base, and varied background patterns that can be customized to fit packages of all sizes and shapes. They also used fresh, crisp photography and more expressive fonts.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/corporate.target.com\/article\/2016\/02\/market-pantry-redesign\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Target press release<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/market_pantry_products_before_after.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for Market Pantry done In-house with Pearlfisher\" \/>\n<figcaption>A sampling of before and after.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old packaging was undoubtedly poor and had a late 1990s private label look that, although functional, what it communicated the most was &#8220;cheap&#8221;. While consistency is a positive factor for brands with hundreds of SKUs and Market Pantry was easy to spot, the system was almost mind-numbingly repetitive and everything looked like a default design solution, from the typography to the food photos.

The logo is always at the top, usually centered, hanging like a literal label; red is the predominant color instead of the bland white; and Hoefler &amp; Co.&#8217;s Knockout seems to be the favored (but not the sole) type family. The flexibility comes through a range of patterns that come and go in the background as necessary; fun typographic choices and inline treatments; a complementary light script font that can turn into badges (below); and really nice product photography.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/market_pantry_typography.png\" alt=\"New Packaging for Market Pantry done In-house with Pearlfisher\" \/>\n<figcaption>Typographic badge details.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/market_pantry_typography_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for Market Pantry done In-house with Pearlfisher\" \/>\n<figcaption>Typography treatments.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/market_pantry_Butter.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for Market Pantry done In-house with Pearlfisher\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/market_pantry_CoffeeCreamer.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for Market Pantry done In-house with Pearlfisher\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/market_pantry_CrackersGroup.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for Market Pantry done In-house with Pearlfisher\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/market_pantry_FruitsSnacks.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for Market Pantry done In-house with Pearlfisher\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/market_pantry_HashBrowns.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for Market Pantry done In-house with Pearlfisher\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/market_pantry_Marshmallows.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for Market Pantry done In-house with Pearlfisher\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/market_pantry_RoundCrackers.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for Market Pantry done In-house with Pearlfisher\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/market_pantry_Spaghetti.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for Market Pantry done In-house with Pearlfisher\" \/>\n<figcaption>More products.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">It&#8217;s a testament to the redesign that the new look &#8212; vast typographic differences and all &#8212; is as consistent as the old look and its prescriptive formula.
