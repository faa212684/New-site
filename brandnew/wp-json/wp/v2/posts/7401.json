The Challenge: There is that Blue Again<\/h1>\n<ul>\n<li>As a way to focus your energy, this volume is about nailing down one, two, three, or more t-shirts that pay homage to the &#8220;There is that Blue Again&#8221; meme that has become popular in the comments. <span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,255)\">The blue is R:0, G:0, B:255 or PMS Reflex Blue<\/span>.<\/li>\n<li>Interpret that in any way you can think of.<\/li>\n<li>Keep it fun, clean, and inclusive by not being unnecessarily mean and\/or overly sarcastic.<\/li>\n<li>We reserve the right to remove anything we deem offensive or insensitive.<\/li>\n<li>No logo parodies will be accepted as it&#8217;s likely they will attract legal action and we have no interest in fielding cease and desist letters.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes red\" style=\"margin: 40px 0 10px;\">3. Design Guidelines<\/h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Limit to 2 ink colors.<\/li>\n<li>Printable area is 11 inches wide by 14 inches tall on the front and\/or the back.<\/li>\n<li>You can use the front, the back, or both.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes red\" style=\"margin: 40px 0 10px;\">4.
