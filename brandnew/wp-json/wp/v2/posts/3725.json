AB Electrolux manages the Frigidaire and AEG brands as well as its flagship and eponymous Electrolux brand which offers a range of products that include kitchen appliances (ovens, fridges, dishwashers), laundry appliances, vacuum cleaners, and all of the accoutrements for these. This week, Electrolux introduced a new corporate logo and retail identity designed by the London office of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.prophet.com\/impact\/projects\/electroluxdesign\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Prophet<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/electrolux_existing.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Electrolux by Prophet\" \/>\n<figcaption>Some existing materials cobbled from Google Images.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>&#8220;With such a distinctive symbol at the forefront, it communicates modern and innovative while maintaining the associations of trust and quality that consumers have come to expect from our brand,&#8221; MaryKay Kopf [Chief Marketing Officer of the Electrolux Group] said.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.electroluxgroup.com\/en\/electrolux-boosts-brand-with-new-visual-identity-20079\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Electrolux press release<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/jwjhj_6aji0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo evolution video.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The Electrolux logo was stripped of superfluous shapes and the tagline, maximizing its visibility and impact. A custom sans serif font was designed that is both distinctive and also evocative of the shapes in the iconic brand symbol, first used in 1962. Electrolux&#8217;s core color blue was darkened for a more premium and modern appearance supported by a palette of bold, vivid colors that will stand out in retail environments.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20150121006029\/en\/Electrolux-Launches-Global-Visual-Identity-Created-Prophet#.VMAteGTF_NU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Electrolux <em>other<\/em> press release<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/electrolux_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Electrolux by Prophet\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/electrolux_logo_detail_background_appliance.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Electrolux by Prophet\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo with appliance-y background.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The most recognizable element of the brand &mdash; the super-serifed &#8220;E&#8221; monogram &mdash; has smartly been maintained by Prophet. It&#8217;s a well-known mark. It&#8217;s a good-looking mark. As weird as it seems, the previous logo was officially the one with the scribbled &#8220;Thinking of you&#8221; tagline on it. The old serif was actually kind of nice but, yeah, that tagline on it is just painful. The main &#8220;revolution&#8221; in this identity is the replacement of the serif wordmark with a proprietary sans serif. Woo-hoo? I&#8217;m no type identifying expert but other than the curved &#8220;E&#8221; and &#8220;t&#8221; this could be any number of pre-existing sans serifs, with some characters slightly modified, so it&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m saying this is <em>not<\/em> proprietary-worthy but unless you are making something distinctly and very obviously unique I wouldn&#8217;t boast about it in a press release. To their credit, it&#8217;s a fairly inoffensive wordmark and pleasant-looking typeface. I cringe a little at the curved &#8220;E&#8221; but I can see its relationship to the counterspaces of the monogram.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/electrolux_typography.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Electrolux by Prophet\" \/>\n<figcaption>Custom type family.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>&#8220;A visual identity is much more than a change of logo and color palette. It represents a new sense of Electrolux as a brand, what we and our products and services stand for and how we want to be perceived,&#8221; MaryKay Kopf said. &#8220;The new visual identity will build greater recognition by engaging people in a positive and emotional way; helping to inspire them, identify key benefits and find what they are looking for.&#8221;<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.electroluxgroup.com\/en\/electrolux-boosts-brand-with-new-visual-identity-20079\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Electrolux press release<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/electrolux_packaging.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Electrolux by Prophet\" \/>\n<figcaption>Packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/electrolux_pointofpurchase.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Electrolux by Prophet\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/electrolux_showcase.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Electrolux by Prophet\" \/>\n<figcaption>Point of purchase displays.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">In application, the identity revolves around a deep dark blue color choice with accents of vibrant colors. It&#8217;s actually nice to see this color relationship, instead of the other way around. Product photography and custom type are applied straightforward and without much fuzz. There is nothing too exciting about this whole project but judging from some of the existing presentation (top image) this is a definite improvement that looks&hellip; clean. And that&#8217;s not a bad thing when selling products that clean or are meant to have food put in.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1919 &mdash; but with a history going back to 1902 and the manufacturing of its first vacuum cleaner in 1912 &mdash; in Stockholm, Sweden, AB Electrolux is a global manufacturer of household and professional-use appliances, selling over 50&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,51,26],"tags":[292,863,42],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3725"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3725"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3725\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3725"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3725"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3725"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
