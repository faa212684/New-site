With that, the goal of creating a novel approach to the D + Globe icon began.<br \/><br \/>In our exploration, we found that the negative space created by the continents on a graphic globe was enough to balance the weight of the circle and allow it to read as the stem of the &#8216;D.&#8217;<br \/><br \/>Uniting the world of Discovery was incredibly important in the process, and with that, they wanted to be sure that the static mark reflected that. After some exploration of both abstract, and more classic map projections of the globe, we landed on a traditional map layout, tweaked to live within the circular shape.<br \/><br \/>Paired with bold modern typography, the new wordmark and icon were born.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/roger.tv\/branding\/discovery-2019-rebrand\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Roger project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/discovery_channel_2019_logo_before_after.png\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Logo, Identity, and On-air Look for Discovery Channel by Roger\" \/>\n<figcaption>Reminder: Logo, before and after.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/discovery_channel_2019_followup_logo_breakdown.png\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Logo, Identity, and On-air Look for Discovery Channel by Roger\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/discovery_channel_2019_followup_logo_breakdown_02.png\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Logo, Identity, and On-air Look for Discovery Channel by Roger\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo elements.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Not a whole lot more to add about the logo after <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/new_logo_for_discovery_channel.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">what I wrote three months ago<\/a>, all of which present-me approves of past-me&#8217;s assessment.

Bringing these stories to the forefront was the focus of our content-centric approach.<br \/><br \/>We started with a simple shape, a customized mortise we called the D-Frame. Derived from the curvature of the mark, this modular form showcased the versatility of the brand and adapted to serve essential functions across the network.<br \/><br \/>Using the D-Frame, we focused and framed footage, and created a diverse set of tools for adding branded elements to Discovery&#8217;s badass visuals.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/roger.tv\/branding\/discovery-2019-rebrand\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Roger project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/discovery_channel_2019_followup_dframe.gif\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Logo, Identity, and On-air Look for Discovery Channel by Roger\" \/>\n<figcaption>&#8220;D-Frame&#8221;.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The identity elements are fairly straightforward, with <a href=\"https:\/\/vllg.com\/sharp-type\/sharp-sans\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sharp Sans<\/a> leading the charge, looking contemporary and crisp. The color palette is commendably limited and each color aptly named. The &#8220;D-Frame&#8221; is the main visual element and I think I would be mostly okay with it if it weren&#8217;t called the &#8220;D-Frame&#8221; because there is not that much D-ish about it &#8212; I mean, I get that it comes from the &#8220;D&#8221; icon but it&#8217;s really just a rounded corner. Still, it has 2 &#8211; 3 slightly different uses that make it interesting and flexible&#8230; sometimes it&#8217;s simply a spark of color in the corner, sometimes it&#8217;s a bigger single-rounded-corner holding shape, and sometimes it&#8217;s an underline, which I found to be the most novel and intriguing of uses. On their own the identity elements are alright but they come very well together in motion.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/discovery_channel_2019_followup_sample_screen_single.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video>\n<hr \/>\n<div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/discovery_channel_2019_followup_sample_behaviors.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Sample motion behaviors.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/discovery_channel_2019_followup_sample_screens.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Logo, Identity, and On-air Look for Discovery Channel by Roger\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/discovery_channel_2019_followup_dframe_stills.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Logo, Identity, and On-air Look for Discovery Channel by Roger\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sample stills.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/336715799?title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"360\" height=\"203\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>On-air look presentation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Sharp Sans looks great small and large, bold and light, and the minimal\/subtle use of motion on all the typography is great with the quick, slightly jerky movements. The layering of the D-Frame in different ways, whether it&#8217;s color on color or image on image is energetic and entertaining. The overall motion approach is trick-free yet very engaging and allows the footage of all the shows to be the hero. I could do with less hashtags but that&#8217;s just me.<\/p>\n<blockquote>For print and out-of-home, the D-Frame takes a back seat to show marketing, allowing their custom visuals to be the hero. Using a smaller framing element or earmark, Discovery can make its mark in a more restrained way.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/roger.tv\/branding\/discovery-2019-rebrand\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Roger project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/discovery_channel_2019_followup_advertising.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Logo, Identity, and On-air Look for Discovery Channel by Roger\" \/>\n<figcaption>Out of home advertising.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Not much to say about these&#8230; the system to highlight each show works well, with each show&#8217;s logo and imagery taking all of the attention. My only complaint here would be that the D-Frame ends up looking like a bad trimming job where some block of color got left off the canvas.<\/p>\n<blockquote>For brand-centric elements, we gave the iconic &#8216;D&#8217; its moment in the sun. Using the same language as the icon itself, we let aspects of the imagery finish the composition, framing them up with the &#8216;D&#8217; shape.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/roger.tv\/branding\/discovery-2019-rebrand\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Roger project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/discovery_channel_2019_followup_D_highlight.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Logo, Identity, and On-air Look for Discovery Channel by Roger\" \/>\n<figcaption>&#8220;D&#8221; highlight.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">The &#8220;D&#8221; graphic, highlighted in the April post, also remains in play and I still think that that&#8217;s one of the best features of the new logo. Overall, this is a fairly pleasing update to the channel&#8217;s presentation with plenty of energy and a simple but nicely layered on-air look that works great with the channel&#8217;s content.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Launched in 1985, Discovery is an American and international pay television television network and the flagship channel of media conglomerate Discovery, Inc.
