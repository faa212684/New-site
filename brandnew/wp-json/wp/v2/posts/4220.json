Now, renamed <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eir.ie\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">eir<\/a>, the company is the principal provider of fixed-line and mobile telecommunications services in Ireland with approximately 2 million customers while currently constructing Ireland&#8217;s largest fibre broadband network that will reach 1.9 million homes and businesses in the next five years. The company&#8217;s new name, strategy, and identity were conceived by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.movingbrands.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Moving Brands<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>A country&#8217;s performance can be measured by its connectivity, and Eircom has this responsibility for Ireland. Because it takes pride in being the network open to all, we successfully proposed that the company should become &#8216;eir&#8217;, a name that conveys its essential contribution to Irish life. It also suggests a lightness and new optimism for the business.<br \/><br \/>The brand story we created to drive the business and the brand, as well as galvanise its people, is &#8216;Essential to Ireland. Essential to life.&#8217;  We created the advertising strapline &#8216;Live life on eir&#8217;, an invitation to its customers &#8211; and the nation. This sets the tone for the new brand&#8217;s vibrant and playful communications. &#8216;Business rises on eir&#8217;, used in B2B communications, expresses uplifting optimism.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.movingbrands.com\/work\/eir\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Moving Brands case study<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/eir_logo_explanation.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for eir by Moving Brands\" \/>\n<figcaption>Concept behind logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The eir identity is a simple but bold brand system, that allows this complex business to intuitively create and deploy a range of vibrant, larger than life expressions. It conveys the business&#8217; shift from a supplier of infrastructure and services to one that is more approachable, human, warm, and positive.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.movingbrands.com\/work\/eir\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Moving Brands case study<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/eir_logo_detail_static.png\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for eir by Moving Brands\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/eir_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for eir by Moving Brands\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail with color variations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/eir_logo_details.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for eir by Moving Brands\" \/>\n<figcaption>Macro logo details.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/eir_logo_with_tagline.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for eir by Moving Brands\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo with tagline.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The previous logo was relatively good. It had a decent, Death-Star-in-construction-phase-shaped icon that communicated connectivity through swoopy lines and the wordmark, despite being unicase, was quite nice. One thing the logo wasn&#8217;t was consumer-friendly. It definitely felt like a corporation with an after taste of monopoly. Dropping the &#8220;com&#8221; was the first bold step in taking this brand straight into the Nike\/Apple stratus of simple, evocative names. The logo can be hard to digest at first glance because it&#8217;s so unexpected but I find it to be extremely attractive, dynamic, and engaging. Everything about it makes it stand out: the upward rotation, the bold script lettering, and the retina-assaulting color combinations. The overall shape of the wordmark is highly pleasing &mdash; it&#8217;s soft and flowing. My only complaint would be the &#8220;r&#8221;, where the shadow is not quite fully resolved and turns the wordmark from a flat-noodle kind of construction to a more tubular one that makes it a little confusing. Nonetheless, I dig it.<\/p>\n<blockquote>At an estimated cost of &euro;16 million, this is the largest rebranding in Ireland in the past twenty years. The brand palette includes 20 different colours and more than 100 agencies worked on all aspects of the rebrand, bringing the new identity, new culture and behaviours to life. Customers will immediately begin to see the change as almost 1,500 technicians will don a new uniform from today with 160 rebranded vans on the road. In total, the eir fleet of 1,500 vehicles will be rebranded over the coming months. All 63 stores nationwide will reveal the new identity on launch day, with a further 53 to get an internal refit in the coming days and weeks. There will be 6,000 TV ads, 4,500 radio ads, 2,100 outdoor posters and 80 million impressions online which will display the new eir brand and demonstrate the new direction for the business. Richard Moat says that the phenomenal scale of the rebrand was a natural step.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eir.ie\/pressroom\/Introducing-eir-the-changing-face-of-Irelands-largest-telecommunications-company\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">eir press release<\/a><\/h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s rare to get the kind of detailed breakdown of how the brand gets rolled out.
