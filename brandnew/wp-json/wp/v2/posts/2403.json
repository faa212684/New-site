The Dolphins have won two Super Bowls, both in the early 1970s, and are the only team to have won all games in a single season but are best known for having Dan Marino as a QB for many years. Lately, not much has been noteworthy to the Dolphins until last December when a sketch of their new logo was leaked and then again in early March when another version was leaked until it was confirmed in late March that, indeed, a new logo was being introduced and unless they are leaked beforehand, new uniforms are set to appear later in April.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/miami_dolphins_leaked_01.jpg\" alt=\"Miami Dolphins Logo\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Leak #1: Late December.

In terms of cartoonish logos, the old one was pretty good, with plenty of decent detail in the dolphin and a good, aggressive look &mdash; although who is <em>really<\/em> afraid of a dolphin with a tiny helmet? The new logo does away with the fantasy of a helmet-wearing logo and instead goes for something more&hellip; acquarium-ish. It&#8217;s an okay drawing of a dolphin swimming (instead of jumping out of the water) and looks fairly convincing and even a little mean, with those slit eyes. The sun doubled (perhaps tripled) in bursts and now looks more like the beginning of a lower back tattoo, which may sound like mocking but for a sports logo it&#8217;s actually not a bad trait. I have no attachment to the old logo so to me this seems like a move in the right direction to bring some seriousness to the team&#8217;s identity.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.eclipsethem.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dustin Brenton<\/a> for first tip on both occasions!<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_130402_a_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_130402_a_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"574\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,26],"tags":[233,643,682,738],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2403"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2403"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2403\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2403"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2403"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2403"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
