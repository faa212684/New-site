We created the Kase Mate to be the perfect solution to keeping beverages cold without the inconveniences of a bulky cooler. The design of our Kase Mate perfectly contours to custom fit 12, 24, and 30 packs of your favorite beverage, and after countless hours of research and experimentation, we discovered the best way to keep the cold in and the heat out. We like to think of it as an insulated sleeve for a beverage case. Our multi-patent pending Kase Mate is lightweight, transportable and easy to store. The Kase Mate is the perfect complement for tailgating, parties, outdoor ventures, and really any other situation that requires cold beverages nearby. Pick the size you want, choose from a variety of colors and designs, and relax with full confidence that your beverages will remain refreshingly cold.&#8221; Kanga was featured (and funded) on Season 10, Episode 18 of ABC&#8217;s <em>Shark Tank<\/em>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kanga_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Kanga by Chris Ganz Designs\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kanga_mascot_before_after.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Kanga by Chris Ganz Designs\" \/>\n<figcaption>Mascot, before and after.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kanga_mascot.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Kanga by Chris Ganz Designs\" \/>\n<figcaption>Mascot.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kanga_assets.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Kanga by Chris Ganz Designs\" \/>\n<figcaption>Various assets.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kanga_pattern.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Kanga by Chris Ganz Designs\" \/>\n<figcaption>Pattern.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kanga_cooler_before_after.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Kanga by Chris Ganz Designs\" \/>\n<figcaption>Cooler, before and after.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kanga_cooler.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Kanga by Chris Ganz Designs\" \/>\n<figcaption>Cooler.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kanga_photography_before_after.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Kanga by Chris Ganz Designs\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brand photography, before and after.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kanga_tag.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Kanga by Chris Ganz Designs\" \/>\n<figcaption>Hang tag.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kanga_photography.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Kanga by Chris Ganz Designs\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brand photography.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kanga_tshirts_a.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Kanga by Chris Ganz Designs\" \/>\n<figcaption>T-shirts.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"(Est. 2017) &quot;Kanga, Kooler Than A Cooler, keeps drinks cold up to 7 hours without the ice!
