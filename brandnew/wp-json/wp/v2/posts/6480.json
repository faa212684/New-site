Users create a job they need completed and professionals on the site can bid on it. I&#8217;ve used Thumbtack a number of times and found one of our favorite contractors through there and one of the best roof guys ever. It&#8217;s easy, it&#8217;s quick, and the ability to comparison-shop is very helpful. This week, Thumbtack introduced a new identity designed in-house in collaboration with Portland, OR-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.instrument.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Instrument<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/263912278?color=009fd9&#038;title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Animated intro to Thumbtack.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote><strong>Meet the Thumbtack thumbtack.<\/strong><br \/>Finally, our logo is an actual tack.

The first time I used Thumbtack I literally had doubts about whether to use it or not simply because the logo didn&#8217;t exude trust; it gave the whole site an amateurish feeling that was a bit unfortunate given how effective the site is. The cheesy script font, the orange color, and the fact that the thumbtack was a pushpin added up to a less than stellar logo. The new logo is one of my favorite of the year so far with the best possible thumbtack depiction that doubles as a &#8220;T&#8221;. It may seem like an obvious solution but it&#8217;s done perfectly right, with a deep, hard shadow that makes the tiny thumbtack look more monumental and bigger than life. It works great as a &#8220;T&#8221; in the wordmark, perfectly balanced in weight with the rest of the letters (which are perfectly kerned) and it works even better as a standalone icon used in white over blue, which better showcases the shadow effect.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/thumbtack_font.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Thumbtack by Instrument and In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Customized version of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.myfonts.com\/fonts\/fontfont\/mark\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FF Mark<\/a>.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/thumbtack_icons_illustrations.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Thumbtack by Instrument and In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icons and illustrations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The icons and illustrations are par for the course for a web-based service: colorful, playful, and faceless.

We leave plenty of wiggle room with abundant white space, a beautiful blue as our primary color, and a secondary palette that frees us up to do more.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thumbtack.com\/brand\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Thumbtack brand page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/thumbtack_app_icons.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Thumbtack by Instrument and In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>App icons.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/thumbtack_app.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Thumbtack by Instrument and In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>App.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/thumbtack_notebook.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Thumbtack by Instrument and In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Notebook.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Not much in terms of applications other than the mobile app and website, which, dare I say it, maybe the latter makes far too generous use of white space&#8230; It&#8217;s almost like the site is missing a full-screen video in the background and more stuff.
