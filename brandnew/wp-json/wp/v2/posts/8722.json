With customers that range from fast-growing tech startups to Midwestern manufacturing companies, San Francisco, CA-based Rippling competes in the market with more well-known payroll companies like Gusto and ADP and online benefits providers like Zenefits. The platform offers payroll; benefit management, including medical, dental, vision, 401K, and more; setting up employees cloud apps; and buying and managing employees&#8217; devices, from laptops to monitors. Recently, Rippling introduced a new identity designed in-house.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>The goals of our brand evolution:<br \/><br \/>&#8211; Become more mature and sophisticated, with a broader set of assets<br \/>&#8211; Stand out meaningfully from the competition<br \/>&#8211; Buck common tech tropes like explainer cartoons and soft, lowercase sans-serifs<br \/>&#8211; Create a hardworking system that matches the power of our product<br \/>&#8211; Speak to business of all sizes and kinds.<\/blockquote><h3>Rippling provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/rippling_before_identity.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Rippling done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Samples of OLD identity.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>Conceptually, our icon embodies three things: the &#8220;R&#8221; in Rippling, the visual of a ripple, and&#8211;of course&#8211;people.

The new logo replaces the simple ring ripple with an abstract &#8220;R&#8221; ripple that&#8217;s more interesting, dynamic, and with some bonus meanings that can be squeezed out of it, including the abstract people, which I hadn&#8217;t seen before watching the construction video. A little on the nose but, I admit, it&#8217;s relevant, appropriate, and subtle. I&#8217;m surprised the three abstract &#8220;R&#8221;s are the same thickness as it would be very easy to vary them and create that ripple effect, the way the animations below appear or kind of like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/rippling\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this banner<\/a>. But maybe that would be too literal and I do like the sturdiness of the monogram as it is. The wordmark is solid with a slight contrast in the thicks and thins and an extended-but-not-too-extended structure.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/rippling_Avatar.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Avatars.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>Our typographic system is built on Styrene and Basel&#8211;optimal in that they work seamlessly in product and marketing applications alike.<br \/><br \/>Our colors (yellow and plum) represent a thoughtful effort to stand out.

The plum and yellow color palette is unexpected&#8230; there is something old-school about it &#8212; and by old-school I mean maybe early 2000s &#8212; with a certain heaviness to it but in avoiding the more expected bright colors it manages to stand out nicely as well as feel fairly serious with the playfulness of the copy and illustrations for balance.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/rippling_credit_cards_b.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Rippling done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Credit cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/rippling_swag.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Rippling done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Swag.
