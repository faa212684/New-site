In broad terms. The upstream business has been spun-off into its own company called <a href=\"http:\/\/www.marathonpetroleum.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Marathon Petroleum Corporation<\/a> and is keeping the old logo. The downstream business has kept the Marathon Oil Company name and adopted a new logo, designed by Houston, TX-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.brandextract.com\/News_Events\/Press\/BrandExtract_Partners_with_Marathon_Oil_to_Launch_New_Brand_and_Website\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BrandExtract<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>The new Marathon Oil logo is an abstracted tri-color energy wave that symbolizes the momentum resulting from its upstream activity as well as the drive and innovation of the Company&#8217;s employees.<br \/><br \/>The process for creating a new logo began in February with an employee survey. Results of the feedback emphasized eight key attributes of the Company: focused, energetic, innovative, nimble, socially responsible, ethical, driven and global. The logo was designed based on these key descriptors.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.marathonoil.com\/News\/Press_Releases\/Press_Release\/?id=1581216\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press Release<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe width=\"573\" height=\"322\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/hDR2iWyJMb8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Logo animation.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/marathon_oil_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"Marathon Oil Logo, Detail\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The old, but not yet deceased, logo was familiar, mostly because Marathon operates about 5,000 gas stations across the Midwest and Southeast, so it had a bit of equity. It isn&#8217;t anything fetching, kind of unsightly actually and if it were a new logo introduced today it would get reamed, but it has that nostalgic patina that designers find so appealing. The new logo has so much corporate patina it has its own executive assistant. Which is not to say that it&#8217;s bad. It&#8217;s fairly competent. The typography, set in well spaced Gotham is quite inoffensive. It doesn&#8217;t pander with all lowercase or a bubbly sans serif. &#8220;Corporation&#8221; aligns with the &#8220;h&#8221; and the end of &#8220;Oil&#8221;. The wave icon, while not inspired sits nicely above the name and the weave of the colors is nicely executed without resorting to gradients or overlays. So this is not a revolutionary identity but for a Houston-based*, large-ass company, this is remarkably good.<\/p>\n<p>* Nothing against Houston-based companies, just acknowledging that they are very conservative and boring (identity-wise).<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.vdla-inc.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Roy Levitt<\/a> for first tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_110823_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_110823_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_110823_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_110823_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,36,26],"tags":[292,314,550,105],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1605"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1605"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1605\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1605"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1605"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1605"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
