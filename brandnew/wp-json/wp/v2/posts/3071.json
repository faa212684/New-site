A vibrant downtown, outdoor space to frolic, diverse population, and great media coverage have all contributed to Mississauga&#8217;s desirability. Last month, the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mississauga.ca\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">City of Mississauga<\/a> introduced a new identity designed by its own Communications Creative Services team with the brand&#8217;s goal to &#8220;help build civic pride among residents and communicate to key audiences why they should choose Mississauga to live, work, invest, play, study, and visit.&#8221; A <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mississaugabrand.ca\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">microsite<\/a> for the brand story has plenty of background and information.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>In order to communicate and promote this compelling brand story to audiences &mdash; both locally and globally &mdash; Mississauga needs a bold fresh new logo and visual identity. The new Mississauga logo is a strong, open and bold logo that will communicate the excitement, diversity and promise of Mississauga&#8217;s story in an innovative and unique way. The three triangles form an open, bold, modern and future focussed &#8216;M&#8217;.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mississaugabrand.ca\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mississauga&#8217;s brand story<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mississauga_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for the City of Mississauga done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>Our logo is deeply rooted in the idea of growth. We are a young City and are on the cusp of something big, of finding our voice, our identity. The open spaces in the design embody the spirit and possibility of a young city that continues to build and shape its story and future.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mississaugabrand.ca\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mississauga&#8217;s brand story<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mississauga_logo_explanation.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for the City of Mississauga done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>The three-part rationalization of the logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/tVkniXXZEZ0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Brand video. Logo animation at the 1:35 mark.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Comparisons to the  <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/City-of-Melbourne\/276451\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">City of Melbourne identity<\/a> are inevitable: both feature an extended &#8220;M&#8221; made up of connected vertices, both utilize &#8220;facets&#8221; in its application, and both, well, they look alike. This is by no means an implication that the team at the City of Mississauga set out to appropriate or steal the Melbourne identity; the groundwork in their research and all their rationalization makes perfect sense and you can see how they arrived at the solution but you can&#8217;t help but wonder if in all that research about branding and specifically about city branding no one saw the Melbourne stuff and thought &#8220;Wait, this looks similar, don&#8217;t it?&#8221;. For better or worse, Landor and Melbourne have pretty much ruined this approach for everyone else, since that&#8217;s the project we all think about when we see similar solutions. With that out of the way, let&#8217;s move on&hellip;<\/p>\n<p>The previous logo, designed in 1987, made Mississauga look solely like a industrial port town. Not an overly exciting place to want to live, work, or study. Plus, how about that &#8220;G&#8221;? They don&#8217;t teach you <em>that<\/em> in design school. The new logo is clearly for a contemporary place &mdash; it doesn&#8217;t quite communicate all the ambitious messages that the city outlines but it&#8217;s definitely in the appropriate realm of city branding. The connected &#8220;M&#8221; makes for a nice monogram; it would have benefitted from some <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ink_trap\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ink-trapping<\/a> in the upper corners to avoid the condensation of vector points. The typography solves the counterspace issues with the &#8220;A&#8221;s by replacing the uppercase letters with lowercase &#8220;a&#8221;s. It works visually, but I have always hated the unicase approach on logos.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mississauga_logo_colors.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for the City of Mississauga done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Color palette.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>Mississauga&#8217;s brand expression comes to life in its new identity system. Its versatile colour palette echoes our rich diversity. The custom typography adds both warmth and distinction.<br \/><br \/>Multiple colour facets and shades reflect our communities and our vibrancy. This approach will allow more playfulness and flexibility to the brand.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mississaugabrand.ca\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mississauga&#8217;s brand story<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mississauga_business_cards.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for the City of Mississauga done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mississauga_ads.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for the City of Mississauga done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sample ads.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mississauga_downtown.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for the City of Mississauga done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Mississauga Downtown-specific applications.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mississauga_erindale_park.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for the City of Mississauga done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Big sign of some kind.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">In application the faceted approach comes in full force and we&#8217;ve seen this so many times now, not just on the City of Melbourne stuff but projects like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/new_logo_and_identity_for_netgear_by_siegelgale.php#.UyBEFkJdX8E\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NETGEAR<\/a>, that there is simply no pleasure in seeing it again.
