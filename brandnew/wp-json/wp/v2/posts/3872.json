This month, Swimming Canada introduced a new identity designed by  by Vancouver-based <a href=\"http:\/\/hulsedurrell.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hulse &amp; Durrell<\/a> &mdash; who also designed Curling Canada, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/new_name_logo_and_identity_for_curling_canada_by_hulse_durrell.php#.VRknuWR4pAc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Reviewed last week<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/swimming_canada_logo_evolution.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Swimming Canada by Hulse &amp; Durrell\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo evolution.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The new Swimming Canada brand was inspired by legends and imagery dating back to the London 1908 Olympic Games, when Canada first appeared on the international stage. [&hellip;] The new emblem reinterprets a century of Canadian swimming iconography for the next generation using a simple, bold aesthetic, and communicates with greater clarity than ever before. The typography reflects the classic, tall letterforms from 1980s-era Canadian swimming uniforms, while the feature graphic was influenced by technical drawings of an Olympic swimming pool.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.swimming.ca\/brand\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Swimming Canada brand page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/swimming_canada_logo_detail.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Swimming Canada by Hulse &amp; Durrell\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo was quite something, with a maple leaf trying to do some freestyle stroke swimming of its own along with some <a href=\"https:\/\/www.myfonts.com\/fonts\/bitstream\/bank-gothic\/?refby=ucllc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bank Gothic<\/a> just because. The new logo is a cool, mash-up throwback to two of the organization&#8217;s original logos, bringing back the swimmer of the first and the large maple leaf lock-up of the second. The maple leaf is just a tad big but, like cowbell, I guess you can never have too much maple leaf if you are an organization representative of Canada. The swimmer figure is strong and abiding by a strict geometry construction &mdash; I love the fact that the same circle pattern that makes the swimmer&#8217;s head also makes the water waves.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/swimming_canada_wordmark.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Swimming Canada by Hulse &amp; Durrell\" \/>\n<figcaption>Wordmark.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The wordmark and all the headline typography are set in Emtype&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.myfonts.com\/fonts\/emtype\/ciutadella\/?refby=ucllc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ciutadella<\/a>, which I hadn&#8217;t seen before and it&#8217;s quite nice.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/swimming_canada_logos_all_old.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Swimming Canada by Hulse &amp; Durrell\" \/>\n<figcaption>All OLD related logos.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/swimming_canada_logos_all_new.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Swimming Canada by Hulse &amp; Durrell\" \/>\n<figcaption>All NEW related logos.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/swimming_canada_logo_in_circle.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Swimming Canada by Hulse &amp; Durrell\" \/>\n<figcaption>Grassroots program and Hall of Fame logos.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/swimming_canada_logo_centres.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Swimming Canada by Hulse &amp; Durrell\" \/>\n<figcaption>Training facilities logos.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>In what is now becoming clear, Hulse &amp; Durrell make some killer secondary logos and badges. (They <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/olympic_maple.php#.VRkqRmR4pAc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">also designed the Canadian Olympic Team identity<\/a> that had some excellent secondary logos too.)

I like that it borders on being literal but also abstract, while adding a splash of color. Overall, another solid identity  from Hulse &amp; Durrell that establishes this national organization as the top representative of the sport.<\/p> ","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1909 (originally as the Canadian Amateur Swimming Association) after Canada&apos;s sport debut at the London 1908 Olympic Games, Swimming Canada is the national governing body for all levels of swimming, promoting and managing swimming programs from entry-level to&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,26,87],"tags":[150,1149,483,1150],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3872"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3872"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3872\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3872"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3872"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3872"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
