The Super League was restructured for the 2018 &#8211; 19 season and is now a fully professional, 11-team competition for the top clubs in the country. Managed by the Football Association (FA), the women&#8217;s football competition also includes the FA Women&#8217;s Championship, that comprises 11 semi-professional teams, with promotion to the Super League to the team that finishes top of the division at the end of the season; and it includes the FA Women&#8217;s National League as well, representing the third and fourth tier clubs. Coinciding with the league restructure, the FA introduced a new identity for all entities, designed by London, UK-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nomadstudio.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nomad<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>The ambition was to create a family of league brands that champion the women&#8217;s game as a united force, and a modern and powerful movement in today&#8217;s society.

The distinction between the Super League and Super League 2 was almost non-existent and the Premier League stood out on its own even more weirdly with a glowing ribbon dance of an icon. The new logos establish a clear relationship between them through the concentric approach to each monogram, the gradient, the halftone pattern shadows, and a cleaner set of wordmarks.<\/p>\n<p>The Super League logo seems to have gotten the most love &#8212; with due reason as it&#8217;s the main league. It&#8217;s the most interesting and well solved of the three with a dynamic asymmetry (horizontally speaking), a good rhythm, and a nice arrangement throughout. The Championship logo is the least interesting because it has no twists or corners to allow it to have a shadow and the outer ring having two notches is kind of odd &#8212; but I get it that that was the formula. The one thing that I heavily dislike about that logo is the rounded corners on the inner &#8220;C&#8221;. The National League monogram is somewhere in between; it&#8217;s more intricate like the Super League but the outer extra rounded corners feel too heavy. Tying them all together is a modest type treatment in a simple typeface and lock-up with &#8220;The FA Women&#8217;s&#8221; descriptor. The color palette is fun and vibrant (as long as it&#8217;s on screen; getting those hues in print will not be easy).<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video controls controlsList=\"nodownload\" poster=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fa_womens_league_instagram.jpg\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fa_womens_league_instagram.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Instagram account.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video controls controlsList=\"nodownload\" poster=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fa_womens_league_broadcast.jpg\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fa_womens_league_broadcast.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Broadcast graphics.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fa_womens_league_patch.jpg\" alt=\"New Logos and Identity for FA Women&amp;apos;s Leagues by Nomad\" \/>\n<figcaption>Super League patch.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The launch campaign draws upon the many benefits of the game.

The first video of the Instagram account gets it more right than the campaign materials, which feel a little flat. Overall, the identity is on the right track but probably needs a couple of seasons and pushing of the visual language to really make the leagues and their games feel more like something you don&#8217;t want to miss.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 2010 (originally as Football Association Women&apos;s Super League), the FA Women&apos;s Super League is the highest league of women&apos;s football in England.
