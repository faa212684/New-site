While that look hadn&#8217;t yet affected the main Snapple teas I preemptively bemoaned their imminent disappearance so you may read most of my reasoning in that post. This month, along with a new formula, Snapple <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bevnet.com\/news\/2009\/3-5-2009-snappl_makeover\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">introduced the new bottle and label design for their core range of teas<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/snapple_bottle_various.jpg\" alt=\"Snapple Bottle, Various\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As I noted more than a year ago, the new bottles have indeed lost their unique personality and now look more like the rest of the market with a very tea-esque look.
