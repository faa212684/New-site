TI currently has more than 270,000 members in over 13,000 clubs in 116 countries. Among its <a href=\"http:\/\/www.toastmasters.org\/Members\/MembersFunctionalCategories\/AboutTI\/FamousToastmasters.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">notable alumni<\/a> are actors Leonard Nimoy and Tim Allen, but it helps people in any profession and walk of life to gain competence in communication that, in turn, gives them the confidence to lead others. In August TI <a href=\"http:\/\/www.multivu.com\/mnr\/49429-toastmasters-where-leaders-are-made\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">introduced a new identity<\/a>, the first change in 70 years.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/toastmasters_intl_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"Toastmasters International\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/toastmasters_intl_ray.png\" alt=\"Toastmasters International\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">&#8220;Ray&#8221; device used on business cards and letterhead.

It was hard not to improve on the old logo, which looks like a faux logo you would find in a superhero comic book. But the new one is just sad. Other than its use of Gotham the logo would indicate that it was done at least three decades ago. The globe is boring, the strokes around it are worse than those in sports logos, and the colors are a downer. This could have been such a fun identity and brand to revitalize with some fresh thinking and execution. I strongly believe this didn&#8217;t have to be a &#8220;slick&#8221; or avant-garde identity, as TI benefits from appearing as an organization with easy access as opposed to one that needs a secret handshake or a fat checkbook but there are many more interesting ways to communicate that, and a swoosh-based globe is not one of them.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to Tom McMahon for first tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_110902_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_110902_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"574\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,79,26],"tags":[114,314,42],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1622"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1622"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1622\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1622"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1622"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1622"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
