Holiday Inn it ain&#8217;t. The identity, designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/workof.club\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Club<\/a>, is subtle and takes a back seat (or plays a complementary role) to the building and its interiors and history by breathing new life into the club&#8217;s historic logo. It&#8217;s not a stop-you-in-your-tracks identity but there is a lot of nice restraint throughout and a couple of fun sparks in the additional identities for Invention Bar and Blue Room, both with a quaint but luxurious aesthetic. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/workof.club\/laac\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Red Gap Brewing by Matchbox Studio<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_redgapbrewing.jpg\" alt=\"Red Gap Brewing by Matchbox Studio\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/redgapbrewing.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Red Gap Brewing<\/a> is a micro brewery in Cisco, TX, with a killer taproom in the downtown of this small West Texas town. The identity and packaging, designed by Dallas, TX-based <a href=\"https:\/\/matchboxstudio.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Matchbox Studio<\/a> is all kinds of small-West-Texas-town goodness, which is a useless thing to say as form of written opinion but there you have it. There is a rugged and clunky genuineness to this that feels right at home. Half the stuff (graphics and patterns and thingamajigs) on the cans, I don&#8217;t know what they are or mean but they are very cool to look at all the typographic badges I would wear on a t-shirt without hesitation. The cans are so Texas they have a shooting target on them. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/matchboxstudio.com\/work\/red-gap-brewing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Alter by URFD<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_alterbeauty.jpg\" alt=\"Alter by URFD\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">Alter (as in alter ego) is a beauty salon in Brisbane, Australia, specializing in hair and manicure treatments. (I couldn&#8217;t find a link or social media account for them but it looks to be real.) The identity, designed by local designer <a href=\"https:\/\/www.urfd.net\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">URFD<\/a>, has an interesting, subtle alter ego thing going with the use of a deadpan sans serif for the name and an extra funky serif as a secondary brand typeface. There are also some illustrations that I&#8217;m not a big fan but what got me about the project was the awesome &#8220;menu&#8221; for the salon&#8217;s services, presented in a great combination of color stock brought together with a prong fastener. I really just wanted to write &#8220;prong fastener&#8221; this Friday. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.urfd.net\/alter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"A range of moody and a little offbeat work this week, with projects from Los Angeles, Dallas, and Brisbane&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[51,11,73,26],"tags":[930,184,1122,633],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7557"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=7557"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7557\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=7557"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=7557"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=7557"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
