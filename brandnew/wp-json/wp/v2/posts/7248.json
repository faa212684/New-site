The identity, designed by local firm <a href=\"https:\/\/www.metricdesign.no\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Metric<\/a>, has a pared down aesthetic through a very simple wordmark and a film-reel-like italic &#8220;V&#8221; logo. The latter isn&#8217;t a novel approach, but the angled &#8220;V&#8221;s yield a more engaging result than other letters in a circle. What caught my attention, though, is the great environmental graphics on the exterior of the building with the white  &#8220;V&#8221; circles wrapping under the awning. The wayfinding too is pretty great &#8212; featured in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.metricdesign.no\/work\/vega-scene-wayfinding\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a separate project page<\/a> &#8212; integrating quite nicely with the building&#8217;s architectural details. Sure beats the AMC by my house. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.metricdesign.no\/work\/vega-scene\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Yoko by Yuchou Pan<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_yoko.jpg\" alt=\"Yoko by Yuchou Pan\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Yoko\/1779576505595714\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Yoko<\/a> is a small Izakaya (the equivalent of a pub or tapas bar according to Wikipedia) in New Taipei City, Taiwan. The identity, designed by local designer Yuchou Pan references Japanese comics and &#8220;some local tricky illustration&#8221;&#8230; both of which are above my pay grade in terms of understanding them or how they are reflected in the many elements of the identity BUT I know a killer wordmark when I see one and that neon-tube-shaped &#8220;Yoko&#8221; is super awesome fun. A secondary logo featuring some sake-pouring also has great lettering. The applications are weird and clunky and all the signs are not the most sophisticated but I think that&#8217;s part of what made this appealing to me &#8212; even the linen texture card is aces. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/panyuchou.com\/Yoko-Izakaya\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Mot\u00edn by Futura<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_motinmx.jpg\" alt=\"Mot\u00edn by Futura\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.motin.mx\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mot\u00edn<\/a> is a mix of coffee bar, healthy food, drinking spot restaurant in Mexico City&#8217;s trendy Colonia Roma neighborhood. The identity, designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/byfutura.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Futura<\/a>, is all kinds of weird, starting with its hero&#8230; a hamster. Why? Who knows. At this point, Futura can do whatever they want.  The hamster in either full-body illustration or in eyes-only usage is both endearing and super creepy but it certainly offers something new and interesting. The typography is all kinds of wrong too with added thicknesses in all the wrong places and weird elements like the rounded corners inside the &#8220;M&#8221;. In a way, nothing in the type or the illustrations or the combination of them work together but it also all works perfectly together. Contradict much today, Armin? You bet. But that&#8217;s what a hamster-based identity will do to you. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/74836387\/Motin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"We go from simple and sophisticated to downright weird this week, with projects from Oslo, Taipei, and Mexico City&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[63,11,85,26],"tags":[186,261,481,564,1658],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7248"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=7248"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7248\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=7248"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=7248"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=7248"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
