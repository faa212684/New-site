The chunky arrow logo is replacing Target&#8217;s red bulls eye in all the products in the health and beauty care category, from diapers to sunscreen lotions. As CNNMoney, one of the first to pick up the story, <a href=\"http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/news\/newsfeeds\/articles\/reuters\/MTFH37207_2009-05-19_20-41-40_N19397824.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reports<\/a>, the new design is just beginning to be rolled out and by the end of the year there will be 800 Up &amp; Up products, which are typically priced 30% below brand names. And in this rough economic times, 30% less to pay for anything is, well, right on target. One of our undisclosed tipsters says the design has been done by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wolffolins.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wolff Olins<\/a>, who has Target listed in their clients page, so it may just be right &mdash; of course, a hundred other design firms have Target listed in their client page, but still.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/upup_floor_graphics.jpg\" alt=\"Up &amp; Up Logo, New\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Floor graphics. <a href=\"http:\/\/mypbrand.com\/2009\/05\/20\/target-up-up-the-next-chapter\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Image Source<\/a><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The blog, My Private Brand, has <a href=\"http:\/\/mypbrand.com\/2009\/05\/20\/target-up-up-the-next-chapter\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a nice selection of images with the new look<\/a>, and he also reports of a comment he received from a sales floor team member:<\/p>\n<blockquote>I work for Target as a sales floor team member, and I am happy to hear you&#8217;ve discovered our Up &amp; Up brand. Up &amp; Up is the new look we&#8217;ve given to our target brand products. Previously where you would have found bottles with similar packaging and coloring to that of their brand-name competitors, Up &amp; Up products will feature witty designs and will slowly transition in as our store&#8217;s leading self-owned brand. Other products that you may see flying up on our shelves include our Target home brand, now named reDesign. reDesign is marked by its innovative turquoise packaging. Archer Farms is still our self-owned consumables brand, and TruTech is our self-owned brand for electronics. Be sure to stop into your local Target store to pickup these great finds!<\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/upup_diapers.jpg\" alt=\"Up &amp; Up Logo, New\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/upup_diapers_02.jpg\" alt=\"Up &amp; Up Logo, New\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Walls of diapers. Photo: Bryony.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Designing private label identities and packaging has to be tough business. You can&#8217;t over-design because then it looks more expensive than the brand packaging, but you also can&#8217;t make it too spare where it looks like what the old Target brand used to look like, which is lame and cheap. Up until now I had never bought a Target branded item because I literally thought I was getting an item 30% more inferior than others. Of course, economic times have changed, and I&#8217;m more willing to buy baby wipes that are cheaper, but my confidence in the product may be enhanced by the new look, which is simple and vibrant. The product images are a little bland and generic, but they seem to work well against the stark white backgrounds and the bright colors. The use of solid rectangles, rather than the numerous waves and curves it used to, gives the Up &amp; Up brand a very contemporary and designy feel.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/upup_toilet_comparison.jpg\" alt=\"Up &amp; Up Logo, New\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong><strike>Toilet paper<\/strike> Bath tissue, before and after.
