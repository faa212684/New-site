The Trail Blazers compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member club of the league&#8217;s Western Conference Northwest Division. The team played its home games in the Memorial Coliseum before moving to Moda Center in 1995 (called the Rose Garden until 2013). The franchise entered the league as an expansion team in 1970, and has enjoyed a strong following: from 1977 through 1995, the team sold out 814 consecutive home games, the longest such streak in American major professional sports at the time, and only since surpassed by the Boston Red Sox. The team has advanced to the NBA Finals three times, winning the NBA championship once in 1977. Their other NBA Finals appearances were in 1990 and 1992. The team has qualified for the playoffs in 33 seasons of their 47-season existence, including a streak of 21 straight appearances from 1983 through 2003, the second longest streak in NBA history.&#8221;<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/portland_trailblazers_logo_evolution.png\" alt=\"New Logo for Portland Trail Blazers\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo evolution: 1970s, 1990s, and 2004.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/portland_trailblazers_logo_evolution_animated.gif\" alt=\"New Logo for Portland Trail Blazers\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo evolution, animated version.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/portland_trailblazers_pinwheel_before_after.png\" alt=\"New Logo for Portland Trail Blazers\" \/>\n<figcaption>Pinwheel, before and after.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/portland_trailblazers_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo for Portland Trail Blazers\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/portland_trailblazers_brand_elements.png\" alt=\"New Logo for Portland Trail Blazers\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brand elements.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"(Est. 1970) &quot;The Portland Trail Blazers, commonly known as the Blazers, are an American professional basketball team based in Portland, Oregon.
