Their customer experience platform is used by over 10,000 companies in more than 100 countries. This month, Genesys introduced a new identity designed by the San Francisco, CA, office of <a href=\"https:\/\/landor.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Landor<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>Genesys partnered with Landor to redefine its positioning and beliefs around the idea that engaging with businesses should feel no different than engaging with people. Landor crafted a new identity and visual system, tagline, brand manifesto, and brand video to help Genesys reintroduce itself to the world. The new identity seeks to capture the adaptability and fluidity of human conversation. Born of three rounded forms that converge to create an abstract lowercase &#8220;g,&#8221; the Genesys name is reinforced while communicating openness and warmth. The new tagline&#8211;<em>Moments connected<\/em>&#8211;speaks to the seamless and intuitive connections required to deliver the world&#8217;s best customer experiences.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/landor.com\/news\/genesys-new-brand-customer-experience\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Landor press release<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/genesys_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Genesys by Landor\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/genesys_monogram_from_dots.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Genesys by Landor\" \/>\n<figcaption>Dots-to-monogram<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/genesys_monogram_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Genesys by Landor\" \/>\n<figcaption>Monogram detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo had a decent idea&#8230; to make a &#8220;G&#8221; out of interlocking swooshes. Except that, well, anything involving swooshes is not really a good idea but, to their credit, the logo wasn&#8217;t highly offensive and looked corporate enough to pass unnoticed. The new logo features a monogram that takes three stroked circles and stretches them to form an abstract &#8220;g&#8221;. I don&#8217;t know how many will share my opinion but this is the best monogram of the year so far. It manages to be simple, clever, and aesthetically pleasing while also managing to convey a sense of flexibility in the company. I also really like the wordmark&#8230; it has an unfriendliness that is refreshing and I realize that is a weird thing to say but with every company going with a chunky, lowercase, rounded sans serif, it&#8217;s awesome to see a company be corporate and own it. The lock-up is just right as well, with what would be the ear of &#8220;g&#8221; going over the X-height, making it look like a visual accent.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/genesys_stage.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Genesys by Landor\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo launch at their own CX17, a Customer Experience conference.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/genesys_poster.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Genesys by Landor\" \/>\n<figcaption>Posters.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/218828426?color=fed100&#038;title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Brand introduction.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">There is not much in application but the video helps illustrate how the monogram can come to life and inform the rest of the identity through a series of icons and illustrations that are all in the same orange stroke style and in animation they establish the flexibility\/fluidity concept quite nicely. Overall, a great corporate redesign that makes the subject of &#8220;contact center solutions&#8221; way more interesting than it sounds.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1990, Genesys is one of the leading contact center solutions that allow companies to establish customer, employee, and business support solutions that range from call centers to digital experiences to person-to-person interactions.
