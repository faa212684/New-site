What has traditionally been seen as a men&#8217;s underwear company (they didn&#8217;t start selling women&#8217;s undergarments until 1982) is now going gender-neutral. Their old logo was an actual horse jockey complete with cap although the name jockey was a reference to jock-strap which was the inspiration for their breakthrough underwear design.<\/p><!--more--><p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Brandnew_jockey_jockey.gif\" src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Brandnew_jockey_jockey.gif\" width=\"470\" height=\"226\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The new logo is an attempt to be a bit more of a fashion brand and before reading about it, it seemed to me that the mark had a free and stretchy motion to it, almost like seeing someone twirl around from overhead. It also has a woolmark-like feel to it which is good and may have been a selling point when looking at competitors and analogous brands. The logotype also seems to have been rounded on the ends.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Brandnew_jockey_Woolmark.gif\" src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Brandnew_jockey_Woolmark.gif\" width=\"470\" height=\"150\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Jockey did try too hard to explain the logo. Instead of keeping it simple, they laundry-listed meanings which confused me more than provided clarity. Sometimes a nice mark just needs to be a nice mark. Here are a few meanings they attached to it:<br \/>\n1.  symbolic representation of the science and math that we are applying in our product development to raise the bar on our 130-year-old commitment to comfort<br \/>\n2.  symbolizes the brand&#8217;s global reach and pursuit of unity and harmony<br \/>\n3.  The ring in the centre is a universal symbol for unity<br \/>\n4.  The seeds of life, which emanate from the ring, are the universal symbol for fertility and were chosen to represent renewal<br \/>\n5.  heritage of innovation, and we are carrying ourselves forward in the spirit of renewal<br \/>\n6.  a spiral or barrel vault, a design that illustrates the universal ratios found throughout nature that Jockey designers are using as inspiration for prints and patterns<br \/>\n7.  People from all cultures associate the number three with the triads<br \/>\n a. spirit-mind-body<br \/>\n b. art-science-religion<br \/>\n c. past-present-future<br \/>\n8.  swirl icon embraces both the brand&#8217;s heritage of comfort and its growth into the future<\/p>\n<p>Did you get all that? <a href=\"http:\/\/www.insideretailing.com.au\/ONLINE\/Default.aspx?tabid=884&#038;newsid856=148&#038;Jockey-unveils-new-logo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Read it again if you like<\/a>. Ok, so this over the top but they meant well. Sometimes over-explaining design is necessary to sell everyone in the room but once they settled on a design, they should have burned this document. Once a brand launches, press releases don&#8217;t matter. <\/p>\n<p>The<a href=\"http:\/\/www.jockey.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> home page of the website<\/a>, as of now, focuses on women which makes it easier to connect to fashion and change brand perceptions. Men in briefs generally talks more about utility and athletics.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Brandnew_jockey_Web.gif\" src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Brandnew_jockey_Web.gif\" width=\"470\" height=\"436\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Jockey&#8217;s in-home direct sales company, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jockeypersontoperson.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jockey Person to Person<\/a>, and their post-adoption family support organization,<a href=\"http:\/\/www.jockeybeingfamily.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> Jockey Being Family<\/a>, have also adopted versions of the new identity.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Brandnew_jockey_PtPWEB.gif\" src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Brandnew_jockey_PtPWEB.gif\" width=\"470\" height=\"307\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Brandnew_jockey_BFWEB.gif\" src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Brandnew_jockey_BFWEB.gif\" width=\"470\" height=\"368\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As with many consumer brands, the rebranding here focuses on many aspects of communication. The logo is just one part. More important is the way they talk about themselves as a brand and company, what their packaging looks like, what their website looks like and how their products perform. <\/p>\n<p>Lesson (I find myself repeating many times a week):<br \/>\nWhile no single touchpoint of a brand (logo, website, print literature, the way you answer the phone, etc. ) needs to overtly represent a brand idea, when you add them all up they should lead you to the idea. Meaning, if you want a brand to appear fun, the logo doesn&#8217;t necessarily need to look fun, nor do the company uniforms. However when a consumer experiences that brand, they better feel like its a fun brand or else you didn&#8217;t communicate the right things.<\/p>\n<p>So, while the logo isn&#8217;t overly communicative, it does signal change and when I go to the website and, I imagine, one of their retail stores, I get it. Good job.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":14,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,51,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/476"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/14"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=476"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/476\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=476"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=476"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=476"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
