It captures the optimism and positivity for the day ahead. As the sun comes up each morning, guests at The Prince Akatoki will wake up relaxed, rejuvenated, and ready for the possibilities of the day ahead.<br \/><br \/>We call this feeling Poetry at Dawn. It is the idea that drives every detail in the brand experience; from the logo, an identity inspired by the colours of sunrise, to a guest experience that emphasises the best ways to start your day.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/82646059\/The-Prince-Akatoki\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Interbrand project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/prince_akatoki_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for The Prince Akatoki by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/prince_akatoki_logo_stacked.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for The Prince Akatoki by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stacked version.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/prince_akatoki_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for The Prince Akatoki by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Akatoki detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The script &#8220;P&#8221; comes from the Prince Hotels logo, which had to be included in the lock-up and even though it&#8217;s treated as nicely and effectively as possible it is indeed the one element that looks out of place with the rest of the project, which is all kinds of delicate, subtle, and beautiful, starting with the &#8220;AKATOKI&#8221; wordmark that converts the &#8220;O&#8221; into a rising sun. No, it is not an original idea, but it is so perfectly executed, it hurts. The implied reflection of the sun as if it were setting in water is simply a crop of the &#8220;O&#8221; itself and I&#8217;m biting my knuckle in jealousy. Not sure if most everyone will share my feelings, but I love it. The stacked version of the logo works best as it looks more contemporary and integrates the &#8220;P&#8221; a lot better.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/prince_akatoki_logo_with_sun.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for The Prince Akatoki by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>With sunrise graphic.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/prince_akatoki_logo_name_explanation_a.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for The Prince Akatoki by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Name explanation and where the sunrise graphic comes from.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/345413811?title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"360\" height=\"203\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo animation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The sunrise graphic is stunning as well&#8230; it&#8217;s just the right amount of feathering, in the right tone, providing the right amount of contrast to the thin wordmark.<\/p>\n<blockquote>The Prince Akatoki design system is a modern interpretation of traditional Japanese fusuma panels. These sliding doors can open or close to redefine the purpose of a room, or they can create intriguing patterns and layers. It is an endlessly flexible system that creates structure for text, acts as a container for imagery, comes alive in motion, and physically divides spaces throughout the hotel.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/82646059\/The-Prince-Akatoki\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Interbrand project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/prince_akatoki_panel_concept_a.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for The Prince Akatoki by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Fusuma panel explanation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/346039888?title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"360\" height=\"203\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Primary illustrations, by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mattmurphyillustration.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Matt Murphy<\/a>, and panel treatment.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The pink on cream illustrations by Matt Murphy are simply amazing and, for the first time in a long time on Brand New, we are seeing a very different style of illustration that breaks the mold from the happy faceless people in flat colors and line art.

Pairing the illustrations with the opening\/closing treatment of Fusuma panels makes them even more delightful with the stacking effect that creates beautiful crops of the illustrations.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/prince_akatoki_panels.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for The Prince Akatoki by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Panel configurations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/prince_akatoki_panels_actual.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for The Prince Akatoki by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Actual panels.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/prince_akatoki_interiors.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for The Prince Akatoki by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sample interiors, in collaboration with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/kate-ingram-0b646658\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kate Ingram<\/a>.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Would totally stay here&#8230; if I could afford it.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/345415093?title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"360\" height=\"203\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Geisha illustration, by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/jeremylord\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jeremy Lord<\/a>, animated by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.neongsan.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brian Neong San<\/a>, and type treatments.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The secondary illustration of the geisha is also great and its line work pairs perfectly with the thin typography and Japanese writing.
