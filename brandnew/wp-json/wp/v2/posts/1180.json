In this specific case being reviewed today, we are also veering a little off from the typical redesign in that there is no big logo change, rather it&#8217;s an identity overhaul through typography for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ihop.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">International House of Prayer<\/a> (IHOP &ndash; KC) in Kansas City. Established in 1999, IHOP &ndash; KC is a young adult Christian organization that combines 24\/7 prayers for justice with 24\/7 works of justice, with many outreach programs for different causes. Ten years later the organization has grown to include more than 50 different departments, and with growth and little control comes graphic havoc.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ihop_brand_tree.gif\" alt=\"IHoP\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Complex organization brand.<\/p>\n<p>Relying on Perpetua and Gill Sans, with cameo appearances by Helvetica, Snell Roundhand, Zapfino and numerous other unwanted typefaces, the identity for the whole organization had become confusing and incohesive. So the internal team took it upon themselves to rethink their identity from the typography up. If you think just choosing new typefaces and implementing is a walk in the park, you probably haven&#8217;t done it for a big organization with board members who don&#8217;t know their serifs from their sans serifs, much less their Gill Sans from their P22 Underground Pro. The research took 18 months and the team explored &#8220;200 typefaces: 100 at minimal depth; 65 at medium; 35 at intense&#8221; to make a final set of recommendations. Yes, perhaps a little overkill.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ihop_type_01.gif\" alt=\"IHoP\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ihop_type_02.gif\" alt=\"IHoP\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">New type families.<\/p>\n<p>The choices were Sebastian Lester&#8217;s Soho Gothic (all weights), Nick Cooke&#8217;s Olicana (all three weights), TypeTogether&#8217;s Karmina serif (all weights), and <a href=\"http:\/\/type-together.com\/index.php?action=portal\/viewContent&#038;cntId_content=2857\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a custom-made version of Karmina for display<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ihop_type_03.gif\" alt=\"IHoP\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ihop_type_04.gif\" alt=\"IHoP\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Custom display version of Karmina.<\/p>\n<p>All good, versatile choices, and as you can see below and on their website, the typefaces can generate a lot of different looks and flavors but retain a unified identity throughout. This is far from the sexiest identity project we&#8217;ve shown here on Brand New, but in identity it&#8217;s not all about home runs, sometimes you just want to fill those bases and start piling up those runs. I&#8217;m not sure how I went from religious organizations to baseball metaphors but there you have it.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ihop_ihopu_catalog_old.gif\" alt=\"IHoP\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Sample of old catalog cover.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ihop_ihopu_catalog_new.gif\" alt=\"IHoP\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">And its new version.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ihop_ihopu_e-mail.gif\" alt=\"IHoP\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ihop_ihopu_internships.gif\" alt=\"IHoP\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ihop_onething.jpg\" alt=\"IHoP\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ihop_fascinate.jpg\" alt=\"IHoP\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Samples of new identity in application.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_100825_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_100825_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_100825_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_100825_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,84,26],"tags":[42,33,239],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1180"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1180"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1180\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1180"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1180"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1180"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
