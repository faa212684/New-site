The four flavours stand out with their strong colour codes, their degrees of bitterness are indicated by 12, 27, 33 and 64, highlighted numbers, and the diagonal cross symbolizes a railway crossing.<\/blockquote><h3>Provided press release<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/farnham_ale_lager_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Farnham Ale &amp; Lager by lg2boutique\" \/>\n<figcaption>Coasters.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/farnham_ale_lager_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Farnham Ale &amp; Lager by lg2boutique\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/farnham_ale_lager_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Farnham Ale &amp; Lager by lg2boutique\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/farnham_ale_lager_04.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Farnham Ale &amp; Lager by lg2boutique\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/farnham_ale_lager_06.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Farnham Ale &amp; Lager by lg2boutique\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sexy shots of cans.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/farnham_ale_lager_07.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Farnham Ale &amp; Lager by lg2boutique\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/farnham_ale_lager_08.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Farnham Ale &amp; Lager by lg2boutique\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/farnham_ale_lager_09.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Farnham Ale &amp; Lager by lg2boutique\" \/>\n<figcaption>Promotional apparel.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>This is robust design made to look easy. Seriously: how many of you aren&#8217;t saying &#8220;How difficult is that? I could have done it&#8221;? The cans have, like, five elements &mdash; the bitterness number, the X icon, the wordmark, the type of beer and its legal measurements, and the color banding. Easy. But these elements are just perfectly and elegantly balanced. Nothing more, nothing less. The right amount of spacing between elements and tracking in the typography. Even the <a href=\"http:\/\/yourlogoisnothardcore.tumblr.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hardcore &#8220;X&#8221;<\/a> isn&#8217;t gratuitous, as it represents the railway origins of the town. The overall look, particularly with the blocky wordmark, is of industrial hipster &mdash; the latter denominator becoming a maturing trend.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in late 2013, Farnham Ale &amp; Lager is a new microbrewery in Farnham, a city in the Mont&eacute;r&eacute;gie region of Qu&eacute;bec, Canada, with a portfolio of four beers, identified by their bitterness level.
