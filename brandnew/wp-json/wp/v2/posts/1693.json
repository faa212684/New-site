In June of this year, Plymouth University launched its new identity, &#8220;With Plymouth University,&#8221; designed jointly by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.heredesign.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here design<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.buddycreative.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Buddy<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>The agencies pitched two approaches. The first was an evolutionary approach which took the most memorable elements of the existing brand and created a refreshed identity. Solution two was the revolution, and took to its heart the aim of the University: For people to say they are proud to be associated with such an enterprising and forward-thinking institution. From that, the importance of the word with was evident. How much better, how much more inclusive would the sentence &#8216;I am studying mathematics at the University of Plymouth&#8217; become if it read &#8216;I am studying mathematics with Plymouth University&#8217;?!<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.plymouth.ac.uk\/files\/extranet\/docs\/MAR\/Branding%20Journey.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Branding Journey [PDF]<\/a> (Worth a read)<\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/plymouth_uni_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"Plymouth University\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The previous logo was nothing more than an uninspiring and abstract dot. With poor typography, there was little support for a school that <em>The Guardian<\/em> reported as &#8220;Delivering a first class campus.&#8221;  The new, comprehensive, and mobile &#8220;With Plymouth University&#8221; brand is a fresh revamp for a public university. The branding feels more personalized, letting the university be whatever it needs to be for each individual student.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/plymouth_uni_typeface.gif\" alt=\"Plymouth University\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/plymouth_uni_color.gif\" alt=\"Plymouth University\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The clean, crisp, and rounded custom typeface does a nice job of feeling friendly while also being neutral enough that the brand can become tailored &mdash; to an extent &mdash; to each student and staff. The calm and clean color palette supports the brand neutrality but adds some youthfulness with its brighter secondary color palette.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/plymouth_uni_collateral.gif\" alt=\"Plymouth University\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/plymouth_uni_ipad.jpg\" width=\"574\" alt=\"Plymouth University\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The idea of a mobile identity is nothing new, and the &#8220;With Plymouth University&#8221; concept walks a fine line in regards to the identity created for the <a href=\"http:\/\/wolffolins.com\/work\/new-museum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">New Museum<\/a> by Wolff Olins, even if a bit divergent aesthetically and conceptually. Overall, having a brand that lives with you and transforms for you is an easy and smart sell for a client and a consumer but not too original. Nevertheless, this identity is something that I would be intrigued by as a potential student, and that is something Plymouth University can embrace.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_111025_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_111025_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_111025_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_111025_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_111025_config_03.xml&#038;xyz=poll_111025_votes_03.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv3\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv3\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":12,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,29,26],"tags":[108,179,172,228,35],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1693"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/12"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1693"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1693\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1693"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1693"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1693"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
