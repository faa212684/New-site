Kickstarted with \u00a31 million from Stewart, the charity is looking to make an impact fast by helping find a cure to dementia within the couple&#8217;s lifetime. The identity for Race Against Dementia has been designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.brandunion.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brand Union<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>Building on Sir Jackie&#8217;s desire to fuel his project with the energy of Formula 1; Brand Union began by creating the name Race Against Dementia, bridging the gap between Sir Jackie&#8217;s past and the urgency of the charitable cause.<br \/><br \/>The second stage involved creating a bold brand identity that is memorable, disruptive and expresses the charity&#8217;s story. The new logo for the brand is the distillation of this identity: a deliberate and graphic fragmentation of the letter D that highlights the distortion and disorientation experienced by those suffering from dementia, whilst also harnessing the speed and thrill of motorsport.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.brandunion.com\/news\/2016-07-11\/5480\/sir-jackie-stewarts-new-charity-gets-off-to-a-head-start-with-brand-union\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brand Union project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/race_against_dementia_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Race Against Dementia by Brand Union\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/race_against_dementia_d.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Race Against Dementia by Brand Union\" \/>\n<figcaption>D monogram.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The logo and identity build on Sir Jackie Stewart&#8217;s racing history and Formula 1 association with a bold, attention-grabbing aesthetic and custom font that integrate the notion of dementia through subtle but abrupt design elements. The logo&#8217;s condensed structure and rhythm is disrupted by the broken &#8220;D&#8221; that, in its italic depiction, alludes to racing, and in its disjointed appearance, represents dementia. It&#8217;s a surprisingly elegant and powerful combination that, on paper, would have probably felt impossible to solve in a way that was tasteful or appropriate. In the standalone &#8220;D&#8221; I keep wanting to see the negative space &#8220;1&#8221; from the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Formula_One\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Formula 1 logo<\/a>, which is an indication of how well this logo builds on the legacy of the driver.<\/p>\n<blockquote>Alongside this, Brand Union developed a visual language that will provide a foundation for the whole brand. This includes a custom-designed typeface (named &#8216;Helen&#8217;) created in partnership with font foundry Colophon, that expresses the visual fragmentation of the logo; a toolkit for photographic treatment using an archive of photos from Sir Jackie and Lady Helen&#8217;s life; and a direct and vibrant colour palette that picks up Sir Jackie&#8217;s Scottish Heritage and the colour of his cars, French Racing Blue.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.brandunion.com\/news\/2016-07-11\/5480\/sir-jackie-stewarts-new-charity-gets-off-to-a-head-start-with-brand-union\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brand Union project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/race_against_dementia_guidelines.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Race Against Dementia by Brand Union\" \/>\n<figcaption>Guidelines.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/race_against_dementia_helen_instagram.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Race Against Dementia by Brand Union\" \/>\n<figcaption>&#8220;Helen&#8221; font by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.colophon-foundry.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Colophon Foundry<\/a>.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/race_against_dementia_helen_poster.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Race Against Dementia by Brand Union\" \/>\n<figcaption>&#8220;Helen&#8221; font poster.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The custom font by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.colophon-foundry.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Colophon Foundry<\/a> is what gives the identity its strongest voice.

Some will likely point out &#8220;that blue&#8221; again and, while yes, it&#8217;s that blue again it at least has conceptual relevance in that it was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=flying+scott&#038;nfpr=1&#038;biw=1459&#038;bih=866&#038;source=lnms&#038;tbm=isch&#038;sa=X&#038;ved=0ahUKEwi4jffyiKDOAhWl34MKHcI_BTMQ_AUICSgE#tbm=isch&#038;q=jackie+stewart+car\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the color of Stewart&#8217;s car<\/a>. Overall, this identity is very well handled and manages to bring two wildly different topics together in a way that is meaningful and, hopefully, provokes action.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established this year, Race Against Dementia is a charity with the mission to raise money to fund breakthrough and innovative dementia research launched by famed Formula 1 driver Sir Jackie Stewart, whose wife of 54 years, Helen, has recently been&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[12,79,26],"tags":[292,1016,108,446],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4827"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4827"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4827\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4827"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4827"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4827"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
