Its identity by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wideandnarrow.co.th\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wide &amp; Narrow<\/a> features an almost obligatory-for-fashion-lines Optima-esque wordmark &mdash; one that seems to be either customized or drawn from scratch with a great thin structure and some tiny spiky serifs coming off some of the letters, giving it a bit of a bite. What caught my attention though is the lovely salmon, paint-like texture. I&#8217;m not really sure what it means or the concept behind but it looks damn pretty, both on gray (particularly on gray) and white. The embossed sticker is a great touch too. Overall, a very delicate and appropriate feel for the product. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wideandnarrow.co.th\/virgin-daisies\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project here<\/strong><\/a><\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Mus&eacute;e Picasso Paris (proposal) by Julien Leli&egrave;vre<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_museepicassoparis.jpg\" alt=\"Mus&eacute;e Picasso Paris (proposal) by Julien Leli&egrave;vre\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">This is not an implemented identity but, reportedly, the runner-up to a competition to redesign the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.museepicassoparis.fr\/en\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mus&eacute;e Picasso Paris<\/a>, whose current logo is <a href=\"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/477422919434264577\/KKXN-8o7.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this<\/a>. The proposed identity by Parisian <a href=\"http:\/\/www.julienlelievre.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Julien Leli&egrave;vre<\/a> interprets the art and approach of Pablo Picasso in a non-literal way by creating a family of typefaces united in their hard-angled construction and visually challenging aesthetics. The main typeface would have been a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.myfonts.com\/fonts\/bitstream\/bell-centennial\/bold-listing\/?refby=ucllc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bell Centennial Bold Listing<\/a> on steroids and with ink traps that could catch a bear. The result is not &#8220;pretty&#8221; but it&#8217;s extremely bold, graphic, and expressive. It would be amazing to see this carried out in full. The project page is in French and a little hard to follow through Google Translate but worth perusing for the concept and additional type images. <strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.julienlelievre.com\/projets\/projet-70\/Musee-Picasso-Paris\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/strong> <span class=\"gray_70\">(Thanks to Nigel Morley for the tip)<\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Roots &amp; Bulbs by Robot Food<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_rootsandbulbs.jpg\" alt=\"Roots &amp; Bulbs by Robot Food\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">We now turn our attention to something more normal&hellip; With a few locations in London, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rootsandbulbs.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Roots &amp; Bulbs<\/a> offers cold pressed organic juices, superfood smoothies, and naturally sourced food. Designed by Leeds-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.robot-food.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Robot Food<\/a>, the identity is minimally typeset in a condensed rounded sans serif that allows the packaging to showcase the densely colored juices. The little patch of grass under the wordmark is enough to add a welcome touch of graphic decoration that literally grounds the type.
