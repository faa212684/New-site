Owned by Groupe Danone (&#8220;The Dannon Company&#8221; in the U.S.) Activia is available in more than 70 countries and is one of the leading probiotic products on the market. Last year, Activia introduced a new logo and packaging designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.futurebrand.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Futurebrand<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>We revisited the entire ACTIVIA ecosystem including a refreshed brand mark, a revised tone of their proprietary green color and new packaging structure and photographic style. The design visually recounts a story at the heart of the new ACTIVIA positioning: the synthesis of science and nature, mind and core, health and pleasure. One of the key elements we created is the new brand icon: a symbol of synergy and balance, key drivers of the new brand storyline. The icon serves as the keystone to the packaging design, creating the new structure for the entire range. All visual elements unite at the epicenter in the form of an upward radiant beam of light emanating from within, a beacon of assurance reflecting the brand&#8217;s expertise and promise.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.futurebrand.com\/our-work\/activia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Futurebrand project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/activia_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Activia by Futurebrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Wordmark on its own.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/activia_logo_with_stuff.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Activia by Futurebrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Full logo with stuff.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The best thing I can say about the old logo is that it was yogurt-y. The way the letters were rounded off along with the stubby serifs and the slight gradient, it had a puffiness to it that looked like yogurt. But the actual lettering was far from interesting or engaging and the fairy dust too annoying. The new logo feels more like a health and active lifestyle brand, even a little bit like a vitamin product from GNC. I could have gotten more on board with the wordmark if the &#8220;T&#8221; weren&#8217;t so droopy and if the &#8220;C&#8221; wasn&#8217;t so <a href=\"https:\/\/www.myfonts.com\/fonts\/fontfont\/ff-cocon\/?refby=ucllc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FF Cocon<\/a>-esque. All the other letters are nice and even the unconventional &#8220;IA&#8221; ligature at the end is convincingly done. The logo with all the stuff is not my cup of tea but it&#8217;s appropriate for mainstream consumer packaging, needing to stand out with flashier graphics to compete with the other products that have flashier-er graphics of their own.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/activia_packaging_old_look.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Activia by Futurebrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sample of the old packaging.

(Except for the fairy dust). The new packaging is very striking, with the &#8220;V&#8221; shape actively drawing your eye to the cup. The fruits inside the &#8220;V&#8221; are&#8230; intriguing. I like the simplicity of the product photography but there is something weird about fruit and gold, diagonal lines coming together. Like, it&#8217;s kinky in the wrong way. The one thing I really don&#8217;t like are the flavor bands&#8230; both how they are not really integrated and slapped on and the typography within that feels default, breaking from the overall elegance the rest of the graphics are aiming for.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/activia_packaging_fruits.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Activia by Futurebrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Fruit label variations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/activia_packaging_spoon.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Activia by Futurebrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>A spoon.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/activia_packaging_sale.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Activia by Futurebrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>New packaging, more or less IRL (as these are still renders).<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Given the amount of shapes and sizes the new visuals have to adapt to (and still manage to include all the information and disclaimers needed in food packaging) this is a commendable solution with some ambition to look different on the shelf. At times, it gets too busy and hard to discern the information among all the lines.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/activia_launch_event.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Activia by Futurebrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Launch event in Mexico City.
