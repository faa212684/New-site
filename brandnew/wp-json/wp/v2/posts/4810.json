A gift that would graciously symbolize the 34-year-reign of his father the 4th King &#8211; a visionary who brought wealth and happiness to his country and people. In Bhutanese folklore this was foretold almost 300 years ago through the Raven Prophecy. The gift, a very special gold plated bottle of whisky, would be officially presented by the 5th King to his father on his birthday. An additional 3,000 bottles are specially reserved for VIPs visiting the Bhutanese Royal Family, such as Royal Families from other countries, Presidents and other notable dignitaries.&#8221;<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Whiskey-Prophecy_00_concept.jpg\" alt=\"New Limited Edition Packaging for the 5th King of Bhutan by VBAT\" \/>\n<figcaption>Concept: &#8220;300 years ago a prophecy foretold the arrival of His Majesty the 4th King of Bhutan. In keeping with the tradition of each King preceding him, he was also coronated with the The Raven Crown. This unique Bhutanese Royal symbol was taken as the central inspiration to create a very special bottle. Around its belly, four deities guarantee its protection and in the neck the Raven proudly flies. The bottle, in honor of the 4th Kings 60th birthday, contains precisely 60 centilitres,1 centiliter for each Royal year.&#8221;<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Whiskey-Prophecy_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Limited Edition Packaging for the 5th King of Bhutan by VBAT\" \/>\n<figcaption>Bottle.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Whiskey-Prophecy_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Limited Edition Packaging for the 5th King of Bhutan by VBAT\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Whiskey-Prophecy_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Limited Edition Packaging for the 5th King of Bhutan by VBAT\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Whiskey-Prophecy_04.jpg\" alt=\"New Limited Edition Packaging for the 5th King of Bhutan by VBAT\" \/>\n<figcaption>Neck details.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Whiskey-Prophecy_05.jpg\" alt=\"New Limited Edition Packaging for the 5th King of Bhutan by VBAT\" \/>\n<figcaption>Bottle and cap detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/175515107?color=84eaea&#038;title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Video presentation of the bottle.
