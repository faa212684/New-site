Like its popular (free and open source) browser, Firefox, this OS &#8220;brings the freedom and unbounded innovation of the open Web to mobile users everywhere&#8221; as Gary Kovacs, CEO, Mozilla <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.mozilla.org\/press\/2013\/02\/firefox-os-expansion\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">announced<\/a>. Firefox OS is entering a very tough market where Apple&#8217;s iOS and Google&#8217;s Android have a stronghold on the market so it&#8217;s up to Mozilla&#8217;s do-good vibe and geek-cred to gain ground on the iOS&#8217; chastity-belt-approach and Android&#8217;s super-deploying powers to become a contender. So far 17 mobile operators around the world have committed to Firefox OS and upcoming smartphones built specifically for it will launch later this year. To help Firefox OS build a broader consumer brand of its own Mozilla worked with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wolffolins.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wolff Olins<\/a> to &#8220;unleash the Fox&#8221;.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>Firefox, one of Mozilla&#8217;s flagship products, has always been about keeping the Internet free and open for people everywhere. This is the guiding principle for the browser, and it&#8217;s also the strategic foundation for the operating system. The Firefox brand, and thus Firefox OS, measures success by the number of people who have access to the full power of the Web. This idea of empowerment, of being a catalyst for individual and collective progress, is the key idea for the Firefox OS experience. And while Firefox OS lives and breathes in a mobile world, the brand reinforces the same vision that inspired the desktop experience.<br \/>&mdash; Mary Ellen Muckerman, Head of Strategy, Wolff Olins<\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/firefox_os_main_logo.png\" alt=\"Firefox Unleashed\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/firefox_os_phone.jpg\" alt=\"Firefox Unleashed\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Firefox OS official logo and mobile OS home page on Firefox OS-built smartphones.<\/p>\n<blockquote>In developing the brand expression for Firefox OS, we wanted to create a connection to the existing Firefox mark but also signal that something dramatically different was happening so we literally &#8216;unleashed&#8217; the Fox, putting it in motion to super power people, products and ideas it comes in contact with.<br \/>&mdash; Mike Abbink, Creative Director, Wolff Olins<\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/firefox_os_sketches_2.png\" alt=\"Firefox Unleashed\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/firefox_os_sketches.png\" alt=\"Firefox Unleashed\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">&#8220;The illustrations of the Fox were developed in close collaboration with Martijn Rijven from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.boltgraphics.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bolt Graphics<\/a>, who helped unleash and evolve the Fox.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/firefox_os_pose_the_bolt.png\" alt=\"Firefox Unleashed\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/firefox_os_pose_the_charge_2.png\" alt=\"Firefox Unleashed\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/firefox_os_pose_the_charge.png\" alt=\"Firefox Unleashed\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/firefox_os_pose_the_leap.png\" alt=\"Firefox Unleashed\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">The different poses of the Fox: The Bolt, The Charge (twice), The Leap, and shown in the header image, The Swoop.<\/p>\n<blockquote>The Fox, like Firefox OS, is fun and friendly, supportive and protective, and fast and powerful. Blazingly fast, the Fox doesn&#8217;t play by the rules. It is everywhere you need it to be&#8211;a force for good that powers your mobile world, ignites your imagination, protects you and your identity, and supercharges your life. Lively, swift, and agile, the Fox puts freedom in your hands.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.mozilla.org\/blog\/2013\/02\/25\/mobilizing-mozilla-blaze-your-own-path\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Firefox blog post<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe src=\"http:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/61518049?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=ffffff\" width=\"574\" height=\"162\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Bringing the Fox to life with the help of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dresscodeny.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dress Code<\/a>.<\/p>\n<blockquote>It was very important for us to create an identity system that had movement and flexibility, consistent with a mobile experience and brands built to live in many different types of environments. That said, the Fox has evolved slightly to maintain the familiarity of the Firefox symbol but embody the spirit of a superhero&#8211;agile, fiery, protective and always looking out for the greater good.<br \/>&mdash; Mike Abbink, Creative Director, Wolff Olins<\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/firefox_os_with_type_01.jpg\" alt=\"Firefox Unleashed\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/firefox_os_with_type_02.jpg\" alt=\"Firefox Unleashed\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Unlike the system icons or logos of Apple&#8217;s Safari &mdash; booooring &mdash; and Google&#8217;s Chrome &mdash; booooring &mdash; Firefox&#8217;s has always been the most memorable, with an adorable fox wrapping its tail around the globe, developed originally by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hicksdesign.co.uk\/journal\/branding-firefox\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hicks Design<\/a>. While Firefox OS simply reuses this icon with the name of the product as its official logo (seen at the top of this post) the brand will best be known by releasing the Fox from its job of protecting the world against its evil OS competitors and letting it run wild and free. At first it&#8217;s almost disconcerting to see the Fox&#8217;s face as well as watching it strike a pose other than the original, but its long fiery tail, determined glance, and bouncy attitude are sure to give the brand some much needed energy. In application, the Fox interacts nicely with type and product shots (directly below) and it can go crazy as in the booth at the Mobile World Congress (also below). While Mozilla could have just settled with its FF Meta-esque logo, it&#8217;s nice to see this company do something much more energetic, visually rich, and with a more human touch that further establishes it as the less corporate of its competitors.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/firefox_os_ad_01.jpg\" alt=\"Firefox Unleashed\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/firefox_os_ad_02.jpg\" alt=\"Firefox Unleashed\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/firefox_os_booth_01.jpg\" alt=\"Firefox Unleashed\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/firefox_os_booth_02.jpg\" alt=\"Firefox Unleashed\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Firefox OS introduced  at the Mobile World Congress kickoff in Barcelona in February.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/firefox_os_pose_sketch.jpg\" alt=\"Firefox Unleashed\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">&#8220;Ty Flanagan from the Mozilla Firefox OS team evolved the system to include a version of the identity for their contributor community to use.
