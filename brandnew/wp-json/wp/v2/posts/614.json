The Seattle Sounders FC were named after a public poll that included the names <em>Seattle Alliance<\/em>, <em>Seattle FC<\/em> and <em>Seattle Republic<\/em> (you can read the rationalizations for these names <a href=\"http:\/\/web.mlsnet.com\/news\/mls_news.jsp?ymd=20080326&#038;content_id=145355&#038;vkey=news_mls&#038;fext=.jsp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a>) as well as providing a &#8220;write-in&#8221; option for the fans to propose something they liked. With 14,500 registered fans, 50% of the votes were write-in options and, from those, 49% offered a variation on the name of Sounders. Now, I don&#8217;t know how many of you are familiar with the history of Seattle soccer &mdash; I certainly wasn&#8217;t &mdash; but the Sounders is a name associated with Seattle soccer since the 1970s, first with the Seattle Sounders that played in the North American Soccer League from &#8217;74 to &#8217;83, and currently as the Seattle Sounders &mdash; four-time champions! &mdash; of the United Soccer Leagues (USL) First Division since &#8217;94. The MLS&#8217; Seattle Sounders will use &#8220;FC&#8221; (Football Club) to differentiate themselves from the USL Seattle Sounders&hellip; although I&#8217;m not clear if the USL Sounders are going away. At first I couldn&#8217;t understand who would call themselves the &#8220;sounders&#8221; but, I&#8217;m guessing, it&#8217;s in honor of Seattle&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Puget_Sound\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Puget Sound<\/a>, the body of water that&#8217;s their pride and joy.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sounders_carey.jpg\" alt=\"Drew Carey\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Minority owner Drew Carey.

And some fancy <a href=\"http:\/\/soundersfc.com\/Article.aspx?id=1230\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">press releasing to go with it<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote>The badge represents the organization&#8217;s personality, image, core competencies and characteristics. This design is loosely based on a heraldic shield, which helped identify combatants who were otherwise hidden by their armor.<br \/><br \/>The Seattle Sounders FC badge was developed with two distinct layers to represent the partnership between the ownership, the community, the players and the fans.<br \/><br \/>The partners are all united under one banner which carries the team name.<\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sounders_backdrop.jpg\" alt=\"Presentation\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>General Manager Adrian Hanauer at the logo announcement.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>There are one too many pieces of flair in this logo: two shields, multiple strokes, banner, illustration, spikiness. It&#8217;s so elaborate that it almost works in its excess and it can&#8217;t help but signify energy and dynamism, so it&#8217;s hard to fault it for trying to so hard. I have a real problem with the double shield, it&#8217;s overly redundant and feels like they couldn&#8217;t pick one style of shield over the other so they just went with both. The Space Needle illustration is actually quite nice, it&#8217;s dramatic and recognizable but, of course, it&#8217;s pretty clich&eacute;ic. I&#8217;m torn on this logo: I don&#8217;t quite like it, but it works nicely for a new sports team, as a badge it fits within the visual language of soccer, and, above all, it&#8217;s not another angry animal. <\/p>\n<p><object width=\"425\" height=\"355\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/6WI3Dfj9NCM&#038;hl=en\"><\/param><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\"><\/param><embed src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/6WI3Dfj9NCM&#038;hl=en\" type=\"application\/x-shockwave-flash\" wmode=\"transparent\" width=\"425\" height=\"355\"><\/embed><\/object><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Seattle Sounders FC Introduction Video and Crest Unveiling.
