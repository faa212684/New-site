Ui, launching with a slow and selective rollout, was specifically created for and being targeted to women as a sophisticated alternative to other sugar-filled drinks. The identity and packaging for Ui has been designed by London, UK-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.notable.london\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Notable<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>Our goal was to demonstrate Ui&#8217;s category-challenging credentials by creating a brand that also felt unlike any other in the sector. The first step was to develop a Foundational Idea for Ui which captured the inspiration behind the product itself (nature and in particular flowers) and also reflected our audience&#8217;s outlook on life. This is how we landed on &#8220;Live a Life in Full Bloom&#8221;.<br \/><br \/>We then set to work creating the brand identity and launch plan for Ui. The creative inspiration for the brand identity was the idea of &#8216;force and fragility&#8217; present in nature and women. In the same way that nature and flowers have dramatically contrasting elements, our brand has bolder graphic devices mixed with subtler &#8216;quiet strength&#8217; moments.<br \/><br \/>When it came to the launch plan for Ui, there was a deliberate decision not to go mass but instead, introduce the brand via a soft launch approach. We created a launch concept&#8211;&#8216;Women of Note&#8217;&#8211;that centred on speaking to and bringing together interesting, inspirational women by hosting a series of small events and tastings. All of which has enabled Ui to build and engage with a like-minded community.<\/blockquote><h3> Notable provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ui_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Ui by Notable\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video controls controlsList=\"nodownload\" poster=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ui_logo_animation_only.png\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ui_logo_animation_only.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo animation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ui_logo_flat_a.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Ui by Notable\" \/>\n<figcaption>Simplified logo versions.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>From the start, the product is very overt about its target audience with a clear feminine aesthetic and I don&#8217;t mean that in a douchey gender-confining way but there is no way you look at that logo and think, &#8220;Rambo&#8221;. The fully detailed version of the logo with the multiple lines is quite delightful and I love how they have taken the ribbon structure that we sometimes see in logos &#8212; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/new_logo_and_identity_for_vy_by_snohetta.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">like this<\/a> &#8212; and loosened it to make a literal ribbon. It looks super pretty. The first more minimal version, with the dark and light combination, still works well but is not as effusive and the second more minimal version, in all black, loses most, if not all, of its elegance and dimension, which is unfortunate as that&#8217;s the version used in the packaging. <\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ui_guidelines.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Ui by Notable\" \/>\n<figcaption>Guidelines.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ui_brand_books_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Ui by Notable\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ui_brand_books_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Ui by Notable\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brand books.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ui_visual_language_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Ui by Notable\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ui_visual_language_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Ui by Notable\" \/>\n<figcaption>Visual language.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video controls controlsList=\"nodownload\" poster=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ui_visual_language_animated.jpg\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ui_visual_language_animated.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Visual language animated.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>I&#8217;m not really sure what all is going on in the visual language but I definitely appreciate its relative experimentation with the loopy ribbons and the straight ribbons and the color bars and the weird condensed\/extended typography and the watercolor flowers instead of what today would typically just be a moody sans serif in black.

The flower metaphor is heavy y&#8217;all. I really like the label strip that keeps the outer packaging sealed but I wish they had used the full version of the logo somehow on this outer container. The bottle itself, I&#8217;m not gonna lie, it makes me uncomfortable. Maybe it&#8217;s some deep-seeded Freudian shit but that giant, draping flower with an accentuated tip is a little unsettling to me&#8230;\u00a0the lack of color, the texture, its size&#8230; I dunno. Nonetheless, its high-end-edness is evident and as a gift to bring over to someone&#8217;s party it&#8217;s kind of epic, becoming a whole topic of conversation and a fun moment gathering around as it&#8217;s being prepared.
