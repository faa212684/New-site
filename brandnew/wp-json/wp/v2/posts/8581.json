It&#8217;s named after the folk tale of a farmer who witnessed a lightning bolt hit an agave plant, cooking it, and releasing its juicy contents, leading to the discovery of tequila. The myth takes center stage on the packaging, designed by Guadalajara-based <a href=\"https:\/\/toro-pinto.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Toro Pinto<\/a>, with a lovely illustration of a farmer facing giant mountains with the lightning bolt reproduced in gold foil. The simple and elegant typography for the name and contents looks great in the white band that contrasts so well with the rich-colored illustrations. I really like how the two tequilas use the same illustration but look so different through very simple color shifts. The abstract lightning in logo form is also quite good and is joined by a range of other badges peppered on case boxes. 10\/10 would \u26a1 <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/toro-pinto.com\/portfolio\/el-rayo-tequila\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Gramo by Sociedad An\u00f3nima<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_gramo.jpg\" alt=\"Gramo by Sociedad An\u00f3nima\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/gramo.mx\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gramo<\/a> is a brand of eyewear designed by the owners of <a href=\"http:\/\/escopica.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Esc\u00f3pica<\/a>, an eyewear retailer in Mexico City, Mexico, whose family has been in the eye business since the late 1800s.

Their glasses are designed in Mexico, hand-crafted in Japan, and named after popular neighborhoods in the city, retailing for around $275. The identity, designed by local firm <a href=\"https:\/\/sociedadanonima.mx\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sociedad An\u00f3nima<\/a>, establishes a high-end and design-y vibe with a minimal but slightly quirky lowercase wordmark reminiscent of typewriter fonts. The winning detail is the double-storey &#8220;g&#8221; that when rotated 90 degrees looks like an abstract pair of glasses. It&#8217;s not a mind-blowing concept but it&#8217;s very subtly and elegantly done here. The bright, rich green color is unexpected and looks great as does all the hipster-y typography. 10\/10 would ? <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sociedadanonima.mx\/#gramo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Machiyenga by Alejandro Gavancho<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_machiyenga.jpg\" alt=\"Machiyenga by Alejandro Gavancho\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/Machiyenga\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Machiyenga<\/a> is a new range of chocolate by Peruvian chocolate maker, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/ivanchoc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ivan Murrugarra<\/a>, made from &#8220;chuncho&#8221; cacao, which is native to Cusco, Peru. The packaging, designed by Lima, Peru-based <a href=\"https:\/\/alejandrogavancho.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Alejandro Gavancho<\/a>, brings together an eccentric mix of typefaces, headlined by an Art Deco titling font that is neatly complemented by Art Deco border treatments framing one side of the package while, on the other side, a geometric pattern reveals the tin foil covering of the chocolate that matches the foil stamping. In a way, none of the elements really belong together but they fuse quite convincingly in the very tempting-looking packaging. 10\/10 would ? <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/alejandrogavancho.com\/work\/machiyenga\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"A special 2019 LAD Awards winners edition of Friday Likes with packaging and identity projects from Guadalajara, Mexico City, and Lima.
