Owned by beverage giant Pernod Ricard, Martell offers seven types of cognac &#8212; with Cordon Bleu being its flagship product &#8212; and is available around the world as a staple of duty-free shops, with its main markets being China, the UK, Malaysia, and the U.S.. Recently, Martell introduced a new identity and packaging designed by Paris-based <a href=\"http:\/\/yorgo.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Yorgo &amp; Co.<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>When redesigning the identity of Martell, we explored the luxury cognac house&#8217;s archives, bringing back details from 300 years of history. We drew a new swift, revived a timeless shield, created exclusive typefaces, and set the global corporate identity brand guidelines.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/yorgo.co\/work_client_martell_visual-identity-209\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Yorgo &amp; Co. project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/238741734?title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"775\" height=\"436\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo changes video.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/martell_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Martell by Yorgo &amp; Co.\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo was fine and could have probably stayed the way it was for another fifty years and no one would have complained but, compared to the new one, it&#8217;s easier to see the lack of refinement or distinction it had, looking indistinguishable from many other spirit brands. While the same could be said for the new logo &#8212; it doesn&#8217;t break any conventions &#8212; the attention to detail is more evident and all the graphic gestures are more elegant and display better craft, in particular the new swift (the bird) with the textural lines and a more organic silhouette that doesn&#8217;t look like an airplane taking off. The Martell wordmark is nice and the removal of the yellow shadow is welcome. The accompanying typography and shield are also a great improvement that cleans up the fuzziness of the old ones for better reproduction and a classier aesthetic.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/martell_custom_type.gif\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Martell by Yorgo &amp; Co.\" \/>\n<figcaption>Custom sans typeface, designed by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.productiontype.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Production Type<\/a>.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>(All photos below by Louis David Najar Vasquez.)<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/martell_stationery.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Martell by Yorgo &amp; Co.\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stationery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/martell_business_card.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Martell by Yorgo &amp; Co.\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business card.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/martell_envelope.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Martell by Yorgo &amp; Co.\" \/>\n<figcaption>Envelope.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The stationery is super tricked out, its production cost can probably cover half a year of your salary.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/martell_packaging_before_after.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Martell by Yorgo &amp; Co.\" \/>\n<figcaption>Cordon Bleu packaging, before and after.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Without paying full attention, and even then, I doubt any consumer would notice the change in the packaging which is not necessarily a bad thing.
