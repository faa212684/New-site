It was hard to imagine then that YouTube would become even bigger or more pervasive but it definitely has and its big, chunky, red play button is as ubiquitous and recognizable as the Nike swoosh. Now, with the launch of <a href=\"https:\/\/tv.youtube.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">YouTube TV<\/a> &#8212; that will allow paying users to stream live TV from ABC, CBS, FOX, NBC, ESPN and other popular cable networks &#8212; YouTube is about to get just a tad more ingrained in users&#8217; lives. To coincide with the launch of the new service, YouTube has introduced a refined play button and new brand typeface designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.saffron-consultants.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Saffron<\/a> in collaboration with YouTube&#8217;s UX team, <a href=\"http:\/\/letterjuice.cat\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Letterjuice<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.urwpp.de\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">URW++<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>One of the first tasks was to redraw the &#8216;Play Button&#8217; to make sure its curves and angles were perfect.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.saffron-consultants.com\/projects\/youtube\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Saffron project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/youtube_sans_play_button_before_after.png\" alt=\"New Type Family and Refined Play Icon for YouTube by Saffron\" \/>\n<figcaption>Play button, before and after.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/youtube_sans_play_button_comparison.gif\" alt=\"New Type Family and Refined Play Icon for YouTube by Saffron\" \/>\n<figcaption>Comparison of before and after.

The one word review is: okay. As in, yeah, sure, it&#8217;s an improvement but let&#8217;s not get too carried away with those grids. But, hey, the quest for perfection and graphic harmony is a worthy one, so big ups to Saffron!<\/p>\n<blockquote>The typeface developed in collaboration with YouTube&#8217;s UX team, is designed to be used in both product and marketing communications to express a uniquely YouTube aesthetic. Together, we&#8217;ve developed a font that combines the vibrant, user-friendly world of YouTube with the bold, freewheeling world of cinema and entertainment. YouTube Sans is the only visual asset that links every touch point of YouTube TV. It will bring brand recognition to a wide variety of digital and non-digital environments. It is slightly quirky and expressive, but also simple and bold, just like the platform it calls home.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.saffron-consultants.com\/projects\/youtube\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Saffron project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/youtube_sans_type_family.png\" alt=\"New Type Family and Refined Play Icon for YouTube by Saffron\" \/>\n<figcaption>Type family weights.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/youtube_sans_bold_character_set.png\" alt=\"New Type Family and Refined Play Icon for YouTube by Saffron\" \/>\n<figcaption>Character set.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/youtube_sans_details.png\" alt=\"New Type Family and Refined Play Icon for YouTube by Saffron\" \/>\n<figcaption>Design details.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The new type family &#8212; which I understand will be limited to YouTube TV and not spread entirely to the full YouTube brand (although in time it probably will) &#8212; feels as if <a href=\"https:\/\/store.typenetwork.com\/foundry\/fontbureau\/series\/interstate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Interstate<\/a> had a one nigh-stand with Comic Sans and the baby inherited 99% of Interstate&#8217;s genes but has that 1% of weirdness that makes it stand out in a&#8230; peculiar way. I wouldn&#8217;t buy this type family to use in a project but it certainly works as a brand typeface &#8212; especially for a brand like YouTube &#8212; to establish a unique visual tone of voice which in this case would be serious yet irreverent.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video controls autoplay loop><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/youtube_sans_scaling.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Scaling.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video controls autoplay loop><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/youtube_sans_play_button_glyph.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Play button ease of use.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>Now, YouTube has a typographic system that can carry YouTube&#8217;s message all over the world across all kinds of media. This is a font that can communicate its brand with only a glance. And a font family that will continue to grow with the speed and excitement of YouTube, itself.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.saffron-consultants.com\/projects\/youtube\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Saffron project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/youtube_sans_youtube_tv_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Type Family and Refined Play Icon for YouTube by Saffron\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/youtube_sans_youtube_tv_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Type Family and Refined Play Icon for YouTube by Saffron\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/youtube_sans_youtube_tv_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Type Family and Refined Play Icon for YouTube by Saffron\" \/>\n<figcaption>YouTube TV application.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/youtube_sans_youtube_tv_app_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Type Family and Refined Play Icon for YouTube by Saffron\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/youtube_sans_youtube_tv_app_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Type Family and Refined Play Icon for YouTube by Saffron\" \/>\n<figcaption>YouTube TV app.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/youtube_sans_ceo.jpg\" alt=\"New Type Family and Refined Play Icon for YouTube by Saffron\" \/>\n<figcaption>YouTube TV&#8217;s launch event in Los Angeles.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">In application there is an odd lack of refinement to it somehow. Like, it&#8217;s typeset too big and clunky for its own good. Maybe it&#8217;s because these are prototypes and not the real thing. Or maybe they are the real thing. It feels like it needs a little more breathing room all around to let its peculiarities sink in. Interestingly it works a lot better when used in white over video, instead of black on white. Overall, though, this fits the YouTube brand and will help in establishing its growing ecosystem of cat videos and live TV.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"The last we talked about YouTube was in 2013 when they introduced a refined play button to complement the full logo.
