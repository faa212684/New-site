Based in Vancouver, Canada, the company partners with different reforestation organizations around the world who in turn work with local people to plant the trees &#8212; as of this writing, 34,163,070 trees have been planted in Madagascar, Indonesia, Senegal, Nepal, and Canada. tentree gathered exceptional attention earlier this year with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/Bwjpxgph9DE\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">an Instagram post<\/a> &#8212; currently <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_most-liked_Instagram_posts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the 4th most-liked<\/a> post on Instagram ever &#8212; that promised to plant 500,000 trees if they reached 5 million likes. It has more than 15 million so far. This month, tentree introduced a new identity designed in collaboration by their in-house design team and <a href=\"https:\/\/sidlee.com\/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sid Lee<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more-->\n<blockquote>[The] new logo needed key elements from nature, so we took inspiration from a tree&#8217;s cycle of growth and the cycle of nature. The new logo utilizes the upward growth and the positive impact of trees. The zero embodies the constant circularity within nature and our drive for sustainability. Like a recycling symbol or mobius strip, it&#8217;s a constant cycle.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.tentree.com\/blogs\/posts\/this-is-how-we-grow\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tentree blog post<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tentree_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Tentree done In-house with Sid Lee\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tentree_icon.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Tentree done In-house with Sid Lee\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icon detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tentree_logo_animation.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Icon animation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tentree_logo_tagline_lockup.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Tentree done In-house with Sid Lee\" \/>\n<figcaption>Lock-up with tagline. <\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/3AjqvSL4tlo\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo redesign video. (Charming!)<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo was awfully &#8220;cold&#8221; for a company doing so much caring about the world&#8230; the blue color, the basic sans serif, and the stiff &#8220;10&#8221; (which read more like an &#8220;I&#8221; and and &#8220;O&#8221;) were not on par with the mission or even the products. The new logo is a fantastic evolution that completely turns around the personality of the logo and is at least, um, ten times better. The new &#8220;10&#8221; icon is lovely, with a great abstract drawing of a tree &#8212; instead of the very literal rendition of the old one &#8212; that has been craftily integrated into the zero. Looking at the icon up close, it&#8217;s a champion of bezier use&#8230; all the curves are smooth while maintaining an extremely pleasant and minimal wobbliness that gives the icon a lot of character. The wordmark, in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/new_logo_identity_and_packaging_for_chobani_done_in_house.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the Chobani Nouveau Typographic Style<\/a>, is, unsurprisingly, quite nice as well, giving the logo plenty of warmth and lovability.<\/p>\n<blockquote>We are also presenting a whole new font and colour palette. The main brand colors we&#8217;ve chosen are all inspired by colours in the world. These earthy hues that naturally paint our landscapes are used throughout our new branding. In terms of typography, we chose a font that&#8217;s timeless and classic, but with distinct strokes. We wanted a look that our customers would be proud and excited to wear.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.tentree.com\/blogs\/posts\/this-is-how-we-grow\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tentree blog post<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tentree_color_palette.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Tentree done In-house with Sid Lee\" \/>\n<figcaption>Color palette.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tentree_custom_type.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Tentree done In-house with Sid Lee\" \/>\n<figcaption>Customized version of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.myfonts.com\/fonts\/latinotype\/recoleta\/?refby=ucllc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Recoleta<\/a>, renamed &#8220;Reforesta&#8221; for their use.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>An additional element we have included in our new branding was a new alphabet out of trees.
