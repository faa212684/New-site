Its primary decoding comes from the English indigene\/indigenous (Romanian &#8220;indigen&#8221;), meaning local, tribe, community, with a twist of &#8220;indie&#8221; (independent, self-determining, distinct, different, self-developing, free, unconventional, small, etc.). It is another name for &#8220;the smartly connected generation&#8221;, consequently the principal line of the brand.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/brandient.com\/en\/client\/92\/indygen\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brandient case study<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/indygen_tribe_message.png\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Indygen by Brandient\" \/>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/indygen_symbol_explanation.png\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Indygen by Brandient\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icon explanation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/indygen_drawing_letters.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Indygen by Brandient\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brandient drawing letters.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"http:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/70183484?byline=0&amp;color=ffffff\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Typeface presentation, available in Office, School, and Tribe styles.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/indygen_livery.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Indygen by Brandient\" \/>\n<figcaption>Livery examples.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/indygen_totebag.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Indygen by Brandient\" \/>\n<figcaption>Totebag.

Starting with the name, which is a very smart play on &#8220;Indigenous&#8221;, &#8220;Independent\/Indy&#8221; and &#8220;Generation&#8221;. The identity is very much in your face, unapologetic, and remarkably genuine-looking. The rough, Occupy-ish aesthetic has been executed really well through the custom type family and the choice of red. It may feel and sound a little too optimistic and cheerleading and entitled at times for a generation preoccupied mostly with text messaging, but the the brand and target seem perfectly aligned. The icon, aside from its &#8220;changing course&#8221; description and ribbon cause reference, also goes will with the idea of a mark for a new tribe, as it also looks like a new gender icon appropriate for both men and women.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/indygen_buddy_detail.gif\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Indygen by Brandient\" \/>\n<figcaption>SIM card is packaged inside an &#8220;urban-warrior-shaped designer toy.&#8221; No evident name given to it.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/indygen_sim_packaging.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Indygen by Brandient\" \/>\n<figcaption>The &#8220;urban-warrior-shaped designer toy&#8221; comes in a box itself.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/indygen_buddy_running.gif\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Indygen by Brandient\" \/>\n<figcaption>Look at him go!<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/indygen_buddy_concert.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Indygen by Brandient\" \/>\n<figcaption>Look at him be!<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">Making a SIM card an object of desire is a fool&#8217;s errand but Brandient and Indygen have actually come up with a solution, by placing the card inside a nameless, badass collectible vinyl toy &mdash; perhaps a few years behind the designer toy trend but still applicable &mdash; that literally embodies the new brand. Overall, this is a great launch for a new product that is not exactly clear what it offers or why someone would need it, but it creates a sense of belonging that no telecom-carrier-branded SIM card will ever have.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Launched this month in Romania, Indygen is&hellip; well, it&#8217;s a SIM card that can be placed inside a smartphone that &#8220;gives you access to an ecosystem of digital products made by young people for young people,&#8221; and one that &#8220;[offers]&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[12,26,89],"tags":[454,53,309,278,918],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2607"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2607"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2607\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2607"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2607"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2607"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
