For this year&#8217;s edition, local duo <a href=\"http:\/\/yaniguille.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Yani &amp; Guille<\/a> created a completely hand-drawn identity that what it lacks in an individual logo to unify the program makes up for with a consistent visual tone that has been admirably done all by hand. (With the support of a hand-drawn typeface). The look of the materials evoke the signs of small restaurants and food vendors commonly seen across Latin America and the pictures from the fair itself are like an amped up &#8220;mercado&#8221; (market). Not your typical identity but definitely tasty. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/28201521\/MASTICAR-ABRIL-2015-ID\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Nolla Nolla by Proxy<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_nollanolla.jpg\" alt=\"Hidraulik by Huaman Studio\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nollanolla.fi\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nolla Nolla<\/a> designs bespoke furniture and interiors for retail, corporate, and residential clients across Finland. Its name means Zero Zero, a quirky trait that London-based <a href=\"http:\/\/proxyventures.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Proxy<\/a> zeroed in on &mdash; !!! &mdash; for the logo. While the &#8220;0&#8221; in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.swisstypefaces.com\/fonts\/simplon\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Simplon Mono<\/a>, the font choice for the logo and identity, already had a diagonal, Proxy flipped it so that it followed the same direction of the diagonal of the &#8220;N&#8221;. It&#8217;s such a simple and playful concept and the minimal execution matches the designs of Nolla Nolla, so most definitely a win-win. (I&#8217;m on fire today with the puns). <a href=\"http:\/\/proxyventures.com\/projects\/nollanolla\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Fair State Brewing Cooperative by Little<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_fairstate.jpg\" alt=\"Fair State Brewing Cooperative by Little\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fairstate.coop\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fair State Brewing Cooperative<\/a> is the first beer co-op in Minnesota, opened in 2014. Since its focus is on building a strong member community, Minneapolis-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.littleco.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Little<\/a> designed what they call the &#8220;infinity pint&#8221; symbol that &#8220;speaks to the unending connection between brewer and community&#8221;. You could also read it as bottomless pint of beer which is an awesome thought. The logo is bold and striking and while I usually like how logos work in single-color application, here the full-color version is stronger. One of the main reasons I chose this one for Friday Likes are the tap handles. I could pull on those all day.The growlers and cans are not bad either. To infinity, and beer-yond! <strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.littleco.com\/project\/fair-state-brewing-cooperative\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/strong><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"From elaborate and hand-drawn to precise and computer-engineered, we&apos;ve got you covered this week, with work from Buenos Aires, London, and Minneapolis&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[1122,906],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4143"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4143"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4143\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4143"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4143"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4143"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
