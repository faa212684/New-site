The F\u00f6nster forms part of a logo system that is designed to reinforce and integrate the brand into modern touchpoints.<br \/><br \/>F\u00f6nster (Swedish) translates into English as &#8220;Window&#8221; and is designed to reflect the point at which IKEA connects with the world, and the world connects back with IKEA. The transparency reflects core IKEA values of openness, curiosity and optimism that have been central to the brand as they strive to create a better everyday life for the many people.<br \/><br \/>The F\u00f6nster complements the existing and iconic IKEA blue and yellow logo (also optimised as part of the recent process). It will be used to tag and brand IKEA content that isn&#8217;t consumed in traditional channels by highlighting specific details, providing different perspectives and complementing work created with any increasing array of partners and collaborators.<br \/><br \/>Being white and transparent, The F\u00f6nster neatly integrates into the beginning, middle or end of digital content, clearly signalling the IKEA Brand and creating more opportunities to integrate the brand with emotional stories.<br \/><br \/>The F\u00f6nster builds on and formalises behaviour that was starting to happen naturally by providing a set of design and implementation guidelines for anyone working with the IKEA Brand.<\/blockquote><h3>72andSunny Amsterdam provided text<\/h3>]]>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"72andSunny Amsterdam has created a new expression of the IKEA logo.
