Give-a-Care is meant to &#8220;recognize the communication gap between women with breast cancer and the people who care about them&#8221; with &#8220;products [that] are not only a supportive gift, but their names and branding help to educate people about what a loved one with breast cancer is going through&#8221; as Alison Lawler-Dean, VP, Marketing + Communication, Rethink Breast Cancer, explains in the provided press release. 100% of the proceeds of the products will go to advance the charity&#8217;s work and mission. The identity and product naming were created by Canadian agency <a href=\"http:\/\/lg2.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">lg2<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>More than just a care package they can actually use, each product is named in a bold way that helps to educate about what a loved one with breast cancer is actually going through. The collection includes products such as the &#8220;My-emotions-are-so-out-of-whack-that-evenmy- skin-is-being-too SENSITIVE HAND CREAM&#8221;, the &#8220;All-the-slow-jams-and-silk-sheets-in-the-worldcouldn&#8217;t- do-it-for-me-right-now-I-need LUBE&#8221;, and the &#8220;I-know-this-hospital-waiting room-like-the-back-ofmy HAND SANITIZER.&#8221; [The] line consists of 22 unique products that range from lemon candies that mask the metallic taste chemo can cause, to a stylish zip-front hoodie that&#8217;s easy to get on and off after surgery.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/lg2.com\/en\/work\/736\/give-a-care-branding\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">lg2 project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/give_a_care_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Give-A-Care by lg2\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>In this case, the logo takes a back seat to the packaging and it would have been easy to do a basic wordmark to tuck away into the corners or backs of the products. Instead, the logo got enough attention to stand on its own as a tight little unit in a circle where they have taken advantage of the fact that the two words in the name have four letters and are split by a single &#8220;A&#8221;. It gives the logo a nice symmetry, balance, and sturdiness. We will have to forgive kerning in &#8220;GIVE&#8221; because that&#8217;s an impossible kerning situation on a curve. But the overall impression of the logo is strong and confident.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/give_a_care_logo_motifs.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Give-A-Care by lg2\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo and some illustration motifs.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/give_a_care_collection.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Give-A-Care by lg2\" \/>\n<figcaption>The collection.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/give_a_care_lemon_candies.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Give-A-Care by lg2\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/give_a_care_skin_cream.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Give-A-Care by lg2\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/give_a_care_water_bottle.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Give-A-Care by lg2\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/give_a_care_lube.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Give-A-Care by lg2\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/give_a_care_lip_balm.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Give-A-Care by lg2\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/give_a_care_lipstick.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Give-A-Care by lg2\" \/>\n<figcaption>Various products.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The packaging for each product follows a simple formula: long hyphenated name, quirky flat illustration, and logo. Very basic but effective in adapting to any surface and size. I&#8217;ll talk first about the execution and then conclude with trying to get into the more subjective aspect of the project. The names are visually split with a condensed sans serif set in uppercase that communicates any of the number of physical and emotional issues faced by cancer patients and then punctuated by the product descriptor in a bold lowercase serif &#8212; this clearly separates the two elements but perhaps too much. It becomes hard to read the whole thing as a single sentence, which is what gives the a-bunch-of-words-strung-together-with-hyphens its effectiveness. The low-fi illustrations are charming and work nicely in contrast with the typography.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/give_a_care_collection_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Give-A-Care by lg2\" \/>\n<figcaption>Another view of part of the collection.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">The product names are what bring this project to life, acknowledging the realities young women with cancer face that perhaps add a moment of levity to their situation (although I have absolutely no way of what it would feel like to receive these so I will stop at assumptions there.) To the folks that purchase these, though, it&#8217;s a simplified gateway into understanding what they are going through. I don&#8217;t know if these products are the answer &#8212; because I am neither a woman nor (knock on wood) have cancer, so I can&#8217;t project as if this were a logo for a university or a start-up or whatever &#8212; but I can appreciate the effort to make something that looks and sounds real and that takes the edge off of some of the walking-on-eggshells sentiments associated with caring for someone with cancer (or any other major illness). Mostly, like the name of the products, it&#8217;s really all about giving a care. <\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Launched this month, and with some time before Cancer Awareness Month (October), Give-A-Care is a new line of products for young women with breast cancer created by Rethink Breast Cancer, a Canada-based charity whose mission is to empower young people&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[12,79,26],"tags":[150,828,53],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4923"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4923"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4923\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4923"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4923"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4923"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
