Over the years, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.avid.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Avid Technology<\/a> has developed hardware and software for audio and video editing, launching products like Digidesign, M-Audio, Pinnacle, and Sibelius with their own brand equities. Now they have all been united under one brand, recently unveiled at the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nabshow.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) Show<\/a> in Las Vegas.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/avid_photo_00.jpg\" alt=\"Avid at NAB\" \/><\/p>\n<blockquote>At the center of Avid&#8217;s brand identity is a new logo composed of simple geometric shapes derived from the buttons, icons and markers that consumers and professionals recognize as fundamental to the digital audio and video solutions they use every day to enable their creativity. The new logo forms a visual connection to iconic shapes that represent &#8220;volume up, volume down, play, pause, record and forward,&#8221; signaling a unification of the company&#8217;s core audio and video offerings.  The distinctive mark also spells out the company&#8217;s name in abstract letterforms.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.avid.com\/us\/pressroom\/brand-identity.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press Release<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p>The old logo was memorable with its italic quirkiness but the new one is both memorable and relevant. At first glance it might feel like a cliche to use the play buttons as a logo, but as truly universal icons for a range of products that are accepted industry-wide, it&#8217;s the perfect use. The result is simple and bold. I could definitely do without the shading, specially being so subtle it feels unnecessary. But this will surely look great on screen and some glossy packaging. I also like the idea of filling in the shapes with images and, while it&#8217;s one of the oldest tricks in the book, Avid pulls it off nicely.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/avid_fill.jpg\" alt=\"Avid Logo, Fill\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/avid_photo_01.jpg\" alt=\"Avid at NAB\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/avid_photo_02.jpg\" alt=\"Avid at NAB\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/avidtechnology\/sets\/72157617139208922\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Avid at the NAB Show<\/a>.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Thanks to Josh McDowell for first tip.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong><span class=\"red\">Update:<\/span> The redesign was done by Wally Krantz (Executive Creative Director), Dennis Thomas (Design Director), and Sam Becker (Senior Designer) at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thebrandunion.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Brand Union<\/a>.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,26,88],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/821"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=821"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/821\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=821"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=821"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=821"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
