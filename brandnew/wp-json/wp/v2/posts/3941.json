Although it pales in comparison to the ubiquity of Canada&#8217;s preferred coffee purveyors, Tim Hortons (and its 4,000+ locations), and the ever-growing presence of Starbucks (nearly 1,000 locations), Second Cup is a very well loved and regarded coffee shop. In December of 2014, Second Cup opened <a href=\"http:\/\/www.secondcup.com\/press-room\/article?id=135213\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a new store<\/a> in Toronto billed as the <em>Innovative Caf&eacute; of the Future<\/em> that would serve as a testing ground for new ideas that would then spill into other locations. Among the features of this store was a new identity &mdash; and name, Second Cup Coffee Co. &mdash; designed by Toronto-based <a href=\"http:\/\/jacknifedesign.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jacknife<\/a>, that was recently implemented at the top level. (Even a couple weeks ago you could see the old logo on their website).<\/p>\n<!--more--><p>For more images of the redesign you can see <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/media\/set\/?set=a.726429854138861.1073741839.347186548729862&#038;type=3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this album<\/a> on Jacknife&#8217;s Facebook page and for more images of the test store see <a href=\"http:\/\/business.financialpost.com\/news\/retail-marketing\/second-cup-redesign\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<blockquote>The updated brand &mdash; Second Cup Coffee Co.&trade; &mdash; reflects a new independent spirit, a commitment to the world&#8217;s finest coffee, and the company&#8217;s vision to be the coffee brand most passionately committed to quality and innovation. [&hellip;] The new logo is designed to convey the re-energized premium status of the brand, and all touch points both inside and outside of the caf&eacute; have been modernized.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.secondcup.com\/press-room\/article?id=135213\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Second Cup press release<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/second_cup_coffee_co_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Second Cup Coffee Co. by Jacknife\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The previous logo was very unambitious: a steaming cup of coffee and some unfortunately flared-serif-ed typography. (And I&#8217;m not even showing you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/second_cup_coffee_co_logo_old.gif\" target=\"_blank\">the full-on gradient and bevel version<\/a>!). Definitely the look of a small, non-competing coffee shop. The new logo shows much more confidence in the name recognition of the company, dropping the coffee graphic and opting for a simple wordmark. If it weren&#8217;t because it says coffee and people know what Second Cup is then it could easily be a fashion line, hip restaurant, cold-pressed juice, or alternate logo of a professional sports team. Nonetheless it&#8217;s a very pretty wordmark, with the right combination of letters &mdash; lots of rounded &#8220;C&#8221;s and &#8220;O&#8221;s and those perfectly aligned &#8220;F&#8221;s and &#8220;E&#8221;s provide great rhythm. So, yes, it&#8217;s slightly generic but once it&#8217;s placed on all sorts of coffee goodness then it makes for a convincing coffee brand.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/second_cup_coffee_co_door.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Second Cup Coffee Co. by Jacknife\" \/>\n<figcaption>Door sign.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/second_cup_coffee_co_mug_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Second Cup Coffee Co. by Jacknife\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/second_cup_coffee_co_mug_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Second Cup Coffee Co. by Jacknife\" \/>\n<figcaption>Mug on little pedestal thing.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/second_cup_coffee_co_bags.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Second Cup Coffee Co. by Jacknife\" \/>\n<figcaption>Coffee bags.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/second_cup_coffee_co_artists_series_cups.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Second Cup Coffee Co. by Jacknife\" \/>\n<figcaption><a href=\"http:\/\/www.secondcup.com\/promotion\/hold-an-original\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Artist Series<\/a> cups.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/second_cup_coffee_co_artists_series_cups_detail.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Second Cup Coffee Co. by Jacknife\" \/>\n<figcaption>Artist Series cups, detail and with sleeve.

Scaling might become an issue early on and some of these clean, suave applications might look out of place in older-looking locations but over time this is poised to be a rather nice identity that will very much distance Second Cup from Tim Hortons&#8217; more populist vibe and closer to the higher-end aesthetic of the newer Starbuckses. The only other problem I see is the name: No one is going to call it &#8220;Second Cup Coffee Co.&#8221;. Try saying it out loud; it&#8217;s two words short of a tongue twister. Just because it looks good as a logo, doesn&#8217;t mean it should drive the naming. And now it&#8217;s time for my own second cup &mdash; lowercase, since it&#8217;s literally my second cup this morning from UCllc headquarters.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1975, Second Cup is a specialty coffee retailer with 345 locations across Canada.
