Its identity, designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/the-studio.se\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Studio<\/a> features a large monogram that is meant to be read both as a &#8220;W&#8221; and an &#8220;A&#8221;. The &#8220;W&#8221; is clear obviously and while the &#8220;A&#8221; not as much, it&#8217;s a nice touch to include it. What makes this more interesting is that the &#8220;W&#8221; is what could be considered by most an upside down &#8220;M&#8221; that has the potential to convey the thinking of the firm that it doesn&#8217;t provide out-of-the-box solutions. This identity succeeds thanks to the execution with the &#8220;M&#8221; drawn in just the right weight, sized big in each application, and reproduced in good-ol&#8217; letterpress (which has lost popularity to foil stamping) wherever possible. In general, this wakes we happy.  <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/the-studio.se\/work\/waldemarson-arkitekter\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Sala Equis by Xavi Mart\u00ednez<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_salaequis.jpg\" alt=\"Sala Equis by Xavi Mart\u00ednez\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/salaequis.es\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sala Equis<\/a> (loosely translated as a &#8220;Theater X&#8221;) is a new independent art cinema in Madrid, Spain, housed in a building that has been a movie theater since 1941 including a run, from 1986 to 2015, as a porn theater. The identity, designed by Barcelona-based <a href=\"http:\/\/xavimartinez.eu\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Xavi Mart\u00ednez<\/a>, is a deadpan take on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?safe=active&#038;tbm=isch&#038;sa=1&#038;ei=HgE2W8OuHKXTjwT9sqKYAw&#038;q=movie+theater+marquee+titles&#038;oq=movie+theater+marquee+titles&#038;gs_l=img.3...17903.18628.0.18904.7.7.0.0.0.0.76.440.7.7.0....0...1c.1.64.img..0.2.133...0j0i30k1j0i5i30k1j0i24k1.0.WrOA6W6hJjI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">movie theater marquees<\/a>.

The   identity and packaging, designed by Glasgow-based <a href=\"https:\/\/thirstcraft.com\/w\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Thirst<\/a> also takes a deadpan approach to the design but adds a touch of humor by replacing the &#8220;O&#8221; with an asterisk, making it look like an expletive, as in it&#8217;s f*cking cold. The design isn&#8217;t super exciting and a minimalist micro brewery identity isn&#8217;t anything novel but this has a sweet balance of simplicity, winking irony, and is very convincingly deployed on everything form livery to glassware.<span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/thirstcraft.com\/work\/cold-town-brewery\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"A solid range of bare-bones-looking projects this week, with work from Stockholm, Barcelona, and Glasgow&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[58,63,11,85,26],"tags":[953,184,1122,1418],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6670"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=6670"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6670\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=6670"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=6670"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=6670"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
