The new identity and packaging, as noted above, was designed by Sid Lee with illustrations by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bioworkz.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ben Kwok<\/a>.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/blue_goose_logos_all.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Blue Goose Pure Foods by Sid Lee\" \/>\n<figcaption>Different logo uses.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/blue_goose_identity_elements.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Blue Goose Pure Foods by Sid Lee\" \/>\n<figcaption>Identity elements.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/blue_goose_statements.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Blue Goose Pure Foods by Sid Lee\" \/>\n<figcaption>Statements.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>I had originally referred to the logo as &#8220;umbilical-cord-ish&#8221; in the heat of the moment &mdash; by heat of the moment I mean completely normal circumstances &mdash; and it&#8217;s still the metaphor that I perceive, which could extend nicely into it being a place of nurture. As a monogram, it&#8217;s a nice stand-alone visual and works best when paired around all the pretty typographic treatments, starting with the main &#8220;Blue Goose&#8221; wordmark that has a nice bounce to it with the curved bottom right corners.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/blue_goose_illo_chicken_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Blue Goose Pure Foods by Sid Lee\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/blue_goose_illo_chicken_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Blue Goose Pure Foods by Sid Lee\" \/>\n<figcaption>Chicken illustrations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/blue_goose_illo_cow.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Blue Goose Pure Foods by Sid Lee\" \/>\n<figcaption>Cow illustration.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/blue_goose_illo_fish_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Blue Goose Pure Foods by Sid Lee\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/blue_goose_illo_fish_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Blue Goose Pure Foods by Sid Lee\" \/>\n<figcaption>Fish illustrations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The illustrations are what make this identity cluck. I mean click. The detail and serene scenes depicted clearly establish Blue Goose as a source of highly crafted products. My only complaint would be that a couple of the chickens have a slightly sad-scared look in their eyes, as if they know their future is the form of a nugget. Still: amazing illustrations.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/blue_goose_packaging_meat.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Blue Goose Pure Foods by Sid Lee\" \/>\n<figcaption>Beef packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/blue_goose_packaging_chicken.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Blue Goose Pure Foods by Sid Lee\" \/>\n<figcaption>Chicken packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/blue_goose_packaging_chicken_full.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Blue Goose Pure Foods by Sid Lee\" \/>\n<figcaption>Whole-y chicken packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/blue_goose_packaging_strips.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Blue Goose Pure Foods by Sid Lee\" \/>\n<figcaption>Nugget packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/blue_goose_packaging_salmon.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Blue Goose Pure Foods by Sid Lee\" \/>\n<figcaption>Trout packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/blue_goose_packaging_sausage.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Blue Goose Pure Foods by Sid Lee\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sausage packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/blue_goose_ad_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Blue Goose Pure Foods by Sid Lee\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/blue_goose_ad_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Blue Goose Pure Foods by Sid Lee\" \/>\n<figcaption>Ads.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">In the packaging the elements come together without much fuzz. Just one thing at a time: Blue Goose wordmark, illustration, descriptor, JUICY PRODUCT. Over and over. The decision to use a dark blue background on all the different materials makes everything feel like a luxury product. Overall, a joyful identity and package system to see.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Two Fridays ago I featured Blue Goose Pure Foods on Friday Likes to a great response.
