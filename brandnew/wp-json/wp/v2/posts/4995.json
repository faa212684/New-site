The company places emphasis on its sustainability and impact on the environment by manufacturing in energy-efficient facilities and offering a recycling program for its tiles. FLOR has 20 retail stores around the U.S., from San Francisco to New York, as well as presence in Costa Rica, Guatemala, and Mexico. Recently FLOR introduced a new identity designed by Chicago, IL-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.firebellydesign.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Firebelly<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>We developed a robust system of thoroughly modern, modular elements, including a broad, beautiful palette of brand colors and undertones, grid-based system of custom marks and suite of icons that captures the clever simplicity of FLOR&#8217;s product and process. With both a print and interactive digital brand guide, we provided in-depth instructions for using and combining elements in unique configurations, so every piece feels personal, colorful and undeniably FLOR.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.firebellydesign.com\/work\/flor-rebrand\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Firebelly project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/188193893?title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"775\" height=\"436\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>FLOR and identity introduction.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/flor_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for FLOR by Firebelly\" \/>\n<figcaption>Main logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/flor_logo_animation.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for FLOR by Firebelly\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo configurations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo was yellow type. Yup, that was the extent of its attributes as a logo, other than spelling out the name. Nothing differentiating or indicative of what FLOR did. The new logo, with the four letters fitting into a square each, begins to convey the nature of their product and once consumers eventually see the different configurations of the logo they can make the connection to the modular aspect. The logo is a strong, wide wordmark with a bold presence and it&#8217;s amazing what a difference the cornered leg of the &#8220;R&#8221; makes to make it feel contemporary. The thin lines between the letters, on the logo alone, feel gratuitous at first but they establish the exposed grid that is visible through the rest of the identity.<\/p>\n<p>Before continuing you might enjoy seeing the <a href=\"http:\/\/flor-brand-guide.firebellydesign.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">online identity guidelines<\/a>. (The <a href=\"http:\/\/flor-brand-guide.firebellydesign.com\/typography\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Typography<\/a> section is particularly pleasing.)<\/p>\n<blockquote>At the heart of FLOR&#8217;s refreshed identity is a killer type system, built around an ultra-kinetic custom alphabet, gamely dubbed &#8220;FLOR Mono.&#8221;<br \/><br \/>The system is thoughtfully structured to scale at any size and carefully balanced to hit the right notes at the right time: Worchester EF infusing core copy with warmth and humanity; pragmatic, pleasant Pitch for user-friendly specifications; and no-nonsense Replica to provide supporting details. We developed a clear type hierarchy and put it to practice right away, creating a suite of in-store messages that call out and clarify what makes FLOR so awesome.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.firebellydesign.com\/work\/flor-rebrand\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Firebelly project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/flor_custom_font_animation.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for FLOR by Firebelly\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/flor_custom_font.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for FLOR by Firebelly\" \/>\n<figcaption>Custom font, &#8220;FLOR Mono&#8221;.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/flor_type_hierarchy.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for FLOR by Firebelly\" \/>\n<figcaption>Type hierarchy.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The identity revolves around a custom font where all characters fit in a square and follows a strict geometric approach that works great for most letters&#8230; except the &#8220;S&#8221;, which is the one cringe-worthy character but &#8220;S&#8221;s are a notoriously painful letter to draw.

I am a big fan of exposed grids and I love how they have used the plus signs as a way to make the grid visible and anchor all text and images to it and yet, despite the strong adherence to the grid, everything has an airy flow and strong tension &#8212; the catalog covers are a great example. The typesetting throughout is top-notch and the earthy color palette gives everything a nice touch of sophistication.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/flor_store_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for FLOR by Firebelly\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/flor_store_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for FLOR by Firebelly\" \/>\n<figcaption>Store interior prototype and render.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/flor_store_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for FLOR by Firebelly\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/flor_store_04.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for FLOR by Firebelly\" \/>\n<figcaption>Store exterior.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">The 20+ stores will take about a year to adapt the new signage as well as the full-on, wall-to-wall redesign of the renders that makes every surface an ode to the 20-inch tiles, even having a grid of plus signs on the floor so that customers can plop and align tiles on them as they shop. Overall, this is a great comprehensive redesign that exalts the product and communicates a design-centric approach for the company.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 2003, FLOR is a designer, manufacturer, and retailer of modular rugs, offering a wide variety of colors and textures in 20-inch tiles.
