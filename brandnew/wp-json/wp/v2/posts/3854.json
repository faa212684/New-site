The idea, by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.julianhrankov.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Julian Hrankov<\/a>, is a horror film festival taking place at night-time in the Grunewald forest in his home of Berlin, Germany. While everybody else is doing faux redesigns using friendly colors and flat graphics, Julian&#8217;s project uses highly-textured illustrations that mix film, horror, and forest elements along with a gloomy color palette to satisfyingly moody results. The ticket with the cut-off finger is highly improbable in real life but it&#8217;s an awesome idea. I also appreciate the effort taken in comping and photographing the project so convincingly. Finally, if you scroll all the way to the end of the project page you are rewarded with a texture pack to come up with your own fake horror film festivals. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/24081745\/Grunewald-Grusel-Horror-Film-Festival\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project here<\/strong><\/a><\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Wildfire by Cossette<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_wildfire_01.gif\" alt=\"Wildfire by Cossette\" style=\"float:left!important;width:50%!important\" \/><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_wildfire_02.jpg\" alt=\"Wildfire by Cossette\" style=\"float:right!important;width:50%!important\" \/><br \/><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_wildfire_03.jpg\" alt=\"Wildfire by Cossette\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">Located in Vancouver, <a href=\"http:\/\/wildfireevents.ca\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wildfire<\/a>, an experiential and events company likes to spark experiences that will make people remember them. Their identity, designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cossette.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cossette<\/a>, features one of the best gimmicks we&#8217;ve seen in a while: a business card printed with match-striking surface. Not only is it cool because fire but because it ties in with events being momentary, having a small life-span, and a blink-and-you-will-miss-it nature. Lighting a match is a tiny, awesome event. The rest of the identity is okay and the &#8220;W&#8221; in the logo could use some beefing up to match the rest of the wordmark but, still, FIRE. <strong><span class=\"gray_70\">No project page available<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Stone Way Caf&eacute; by Shore<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_stonewaycafe.jpg\" alt=\"CStone Way Caf&eacute; by Shore\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">Housed inside a commanding black concrete building, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.stonewaycafe.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Stone Way Caf&eacute;<\/a> is a charming spot serving everything from said coffee to beer, wine, and sammiches in the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fremont,_Seattle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fremont<\/a> neighborhood of Seattle, WA. The identity, designed by Seattle-based <a href=\"http:\/\/madebyshore.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Shore<\/a>, features a range of wobbly, hipstery typographic stylings that come in a variety of flavors, from the primary condensed typeface created for the project to other extended, italicized, and serif-ed variations. The type in a circle version is pretty cool and looks great as a stamp for the buy-10-get-1-free card and against the black concrete. The black and white type treatments work very well printed against the carefully selected dinner- and beverage-ware. <a href=\"http:\/\/madebyshore.com\/#\/projects\/stonewaycafe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.
