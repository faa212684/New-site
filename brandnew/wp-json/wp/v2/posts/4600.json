Not that it matters much now, after 15 years of use and perhaps another 15 given that Oi has doubled down on the original premise and multiplied its logo variations and color combinations by 10.<\/p>\n<p>The new range of wobbles range from the normal in the upper-left corner of the grid of logos shown a few scrolls up to the nearly comical in the bottom-right, all in a &#8220;restrained&#8221; palette of three gradients. It&#8217;s a logical next step but, more than that, it&#8217;s a welcome case of a company sticking with its identity and not changing it for change&#8217;s sake. 15 years later, it would have been easy for someone in power at Oi to get bored or want to make a statement and order up a change. I appreciated the relative simplicity of the old system but I also like this a lot, it&#8217;s like the old system went off the hinges just short of Britney-Spears-head-shaving crazy. And that&#8217;s a good place to be.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/oi_type.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Oi by Wolff Olins and Futurebrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Typography.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/oi_icons.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Oi by Wolff Olins and Futurebrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icons.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/oi_elements_overview.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Oi by Wolff Olins and Futurebrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Identity elements overview.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/oi_ad_usage.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Oi by Wolff Olins and Futurebrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Ad color compositions.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/oi_sample_ads_illustration.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Oi by Wolff Olins and Futurebrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sample ads with illustrations by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lav.re\/OI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jo\u00e3o Lavieri<\/a>.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/oi_ad_samples_lots.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Oi by Wolff Olins and Futurebrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Plenty of sample ads.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/rbZmVZ0l5Ao\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>TV spot.

At times it&#8217;s hard to focus your eyes on anything specific in the sample ads but I guess that&#8217;s part of the appeal, to be somewhat of a visual onslaught. Oi was an uncommon identity in the early 2000s but with more brands being more visually expressive, its weirdo patina has wore off slightly so Oi has sprinted forward once again and established some distance between other brands and theirs.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1998, Oi (which means &quot;Hi&quot; in Portuguese) is the largest telecommunications company both in Brazil and South America, with 74.7 million customers.
