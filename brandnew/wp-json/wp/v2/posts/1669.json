The new symbol establishes a bright, friendly palette of blue, green and orange. The &#8220;tree of life&#8221; idea (and equity) are retained, conveying strength and security, but the tree is now dominated by a human figure in a universal posture of joyful well-being. The radiating leaves, Jerry notes, &#8220;reinforce the concept of achieving one&#8217;s full potential.&#8221; A touch of horizon is added, suggesting global scope. That&#8217;s a lot of content for one small image.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/identityworks.com\/reviews\/2011\/Cigna.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Review and insight from Identityworks<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cigna_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"Cigna\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The old logo, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.leadercreative.com\/work\/cigna-corporation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">designed in 1993 by Lindon Leader at Landor<\/a> and nicknamed the &#8220;Tree of Life&#8221;, was a nice early 1990s abstraction of a tree inside a funnily undulating square with a boringly corporate serif underneath. Quirky but with plenty of equity after 18 years. The new logo retains the tree and then adds a whole of bunch of visual clich&eacute;s and annoyances. First there is the generic shapeless human being in the tree, then there is a swoosh behind it, then there is the cheesy friendly blue and green palette, and finally, there is some over-spaced boringly corporate sans-serif underneath. The one redeeming aspect of this logo, at least in execution, are the leaves on the tree. Those are nice. Other than that, this feels like a complete step backward in logo design: it&#8217;s old school in all the wrong ways. And, probably even less helpful to the new brand positioning, it is totally disconnected from the advertising.<\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"574\" height=\"292\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Vk4WOO9yTOA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"574\" height=\"292\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/QXuleVjACPY\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">National TV campaign spots by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hhcc.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hill Holiday<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cigna_ad_tee.gif\" alt=\"Cigna\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cigna_ad_text.gif\" alt=\"Cigna\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The TV ads are quite good.

The print ads are colorful and bold, with their own color palette and typography and deporting the logo in a single color to the faraway corner where, unfortunately, it deserves to be.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sterlingbrands.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Debbie Millman<\/a> for first tip.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_111010_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_111010_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_111010_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_111010_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_111010_config_03.xml&#038;xyz=poll_111010_votes_03.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv3\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv3\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,72,26],"tags":[575,42,629],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1669"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1669"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1669\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1669"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1669"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1669"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
