In other words, if NKOM ain&#8217;t happy you are not getting any communicatin&#8217; done. Based  in the town of Lillesand, NKOM has 150 employees and is self-financed through fees and charges. This January, along with the name change, the agency introduced a new logo designed by Kristiansand, Norway-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.opdesign.no\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Op designstudio<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>In the new agency marque, the letters of the acronym form the corners of a square.We placed the lion at the centre, like a sentry in an intersection. Horizontal, vertical and diagonal lines run through the letters and the lion, which can symbolize (Internet) traffic. The openness of the design reflects a modern government body, as well as its aims: all lines must be open in order to ensure uninterrupted communications and trade through electronic channels.<br \/><br \/>The symbol is blue, in accordance with the logo of the overarching Ministry of Transport and Communications. The letters &#8220;NKOM&#8221; are custom designed to match the graphic character of the lion. Type choice for &#8220;National Communications Authority&#8221; is made in compliance with the Government&#8217;s visual identity.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.opdesign.no\/work\/nkom\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Op designstudio project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nkom_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Name and Logo for NKOM by Op designstudio\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nkom_logo_small.png\" alt=\"New Name and Logo for NKOM by Op designstudio\" \/>\n<figcaption>A couple of lock-up options and in both languages. Displayed small on purpose so that you can see the lion shrunk down.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo was sort of okay, with a definite telecomm vibe but it didn&#8217;t quite look like a government agency, more like just another service provider. The new logo, simply by including a representation of the lion found in Norway&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Coat_of_arms_of_Norway\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">coat of arms<\/a>, achieves instant government-cred. The lion drawing features sharp, blunt corners and hard angles &mdash; up close it&#8217;s not the prettiest thing in the world but it reduces <em>really<\/em> well. The placement of the NKOM letters around the lion is unconventional &mdash; both for logos in general and for coat-of-arm treatments &mdash; and gives the logo a very contemporary and fresh look. As a unit, it looks quite cool. The typography, abiding by the government&#8217;s identity guidelines, is a decent complement.<\/p>\n<blockquote>To complement the strictness of the marque, we have developed a concept for supporting graphics based on the northern lights. The elements are being developed both for use in print and motion graphics.
