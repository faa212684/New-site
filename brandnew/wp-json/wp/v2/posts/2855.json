Its range of beers, from White Beer to American IPA to Porter have made Feral one of the most popular craft breweries in Australia and one of the most celebrated, having won many prizes at the Australian International Beer Awards, including being the current titleholders of Best Large Australian Brewery. Yet, Feral remains unknown to less discerning beer drinkers and they wanted to extend their reach through a redesign of their logo and beer packaging, designed by Perth-based <a href=\"http:\/\/blockbranding.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Block<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/feral_original_bottles.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Feral Brewing Company by Block\" \/>\n<figcaption>Original bottles.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/feral_bottle.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Feral Brewing Company by Block\" \/>\n<figcaption>Before and after comparison of Feral White.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>Block&#8217;s rebranding is handcrafted and distinctive without detracting from the company&#8217;s obsessive focus on its beers, flavours and ingredients, with an intentionally DIY, rough-and-ready aesthetic to match the company&#8217;s hands-on approach to brewing.<br \/><br \/>&#8220;At a time when all the big guys are jumping on the craft brew trend and every bloke and his accountant-mate starting a trendy craft-brewery, Feral is the real deal. Feral is all about what&#8217;s in the bottle, so we felt this rebranding shouldn&#8217;t look overworked or pretentious. What we have created is the antithesis of the minimalist or &#8216;ye olde&#8217; beer brands that are cluttering the market,&#8221; says Mark Braddock, Creative Director at Block.<br \/><br \/>The branding process started with the purchase of an old photocopier for $50 so that the packaging and promotional material would be genuinely fresh and DIY.<\/blockquote><h3>Provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/feral_bottle_all.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Feral Brewing Company by Block\" \/>\n<figcaption>New range of bottles.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Block was kind enough to share some of the non-design materials presented to Feral, including the non-scientific research below, sketches of the titular hog, and the brand vision for the brewery.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/feral_observations.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Feral Brewing Company by Block\" \/>\n<figcaption>Some observations by Block on the state of craft beer packaging.

While the original bottles and logo had that naive, amateur charm of craft breweries and their unpolished logos and labels &mdash; which can only take a brewery so far &mdash; the new approach maintains the same raw energy but with a much clearer purpose and strategy. Even if the punk rock collage aesthetic isn&#8217;t your thing, the level of consistency within the inconsistent and chaotic look is perfectly crafted &mdash; speaking for myself, the punk rock collage aesthetic is very much my thing (mostly because I can&#8217;t do it myself but wish I could). The resulting identity is as bad-ass as the brewery&#8217;s name and everything from the cutout animal illustrations to the red pencil markings to the flaming ass of the smoked porter makes me want to drop what I&#8217;m doing and drink a beer.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 2002, Feral Brewing Company is a family owned and operated hand-crafted craftbrewery in Perth, Australia.
