Fine. Let&#8217;s take it to the opposite end of the spectrum, shall we? <a href=\"http:\/\/www.visceralgames.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Visceral Games<\/a> is the newly minted name for EA&#8217;s Electronic Arts Redwood Shores (EARS) studio that has been responsible for gory, action-packed games like <a href=\"http:\/\/deadspace.ea.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Dead Space<\/em><\/a>. Its tagline &mdash; which follows the same premise as EA&#8217;s &#8220;It&#8217;s in the Game&#8221; &mdash; is the more heart-wrenching &#8220;It&#8217;s in our blood.&#8221; The identity has been designed by Venice, California based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.arnson.biz\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Arnson Communications<\/a> in collaboration with <a href=\"http:\/\/xk9.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bill Dawson<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>&#8220;Action, intensity, excellence. It isn&#8217;t just in our DNA, it&#8217;s in our blood,&#8221; said Glen Schofield, VP and GM of Visceral Games. &#8220;For the past two years, we have adopted a new culture that prizes excellence above all else. Primal action is the beating heart of the studio and now our new name reflects that.&#8221;<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gamesindustry.biz\/articles\/visceral-studio-the-new-name-for-ea-redwood-shores\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press Release<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/visceral_logo_detail.jpg\" alt=\"Visceral Games Logo, Detail\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/visceral_ea_logo.jpg\" alt=\"Visceral Games Logo, with EA\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>The EA logo gone visceral.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>To be perfectly honest, this is isn&#8217;t my kind of logo, I rarely wake up in the morning and think &#8220;Man, what I really want to do today is an X-rayed skull for my client.&#8221; Nor do I get excited by highly textured logos or grunge-painted typography. But, to hell with that, the logo works. It&#8217;s, well, visceral. And it&#8217;s uncomfortable and I don&#8217;t want to look at it for any period longer than what I already did. This is also a logo that will live on screen and on the web, so it makes sense to have a full blown image-based logo. Even when it&#8217;s in print, which will likely be on the video game package, it will be a full-blown 4-color print anyway. Faxing or embroidering is likely the least probable uses for this logo.<\/p>\n<p>If I had any formal critiques as I would with a more &#8220;normal&#8221; logo I would say the VISCERAL typography could use some looser tracking and at the same time it could be somehow more integrated with the background, as it feels like it&#8217;s just placed on top, maybe getting rid of the blue stroke would help. The skull could be smaller as it sort of eclipses everything else. And perhaps a few other details here and there, but overall the logo achieves what it needs.<\/p>\n<p><object classid=\"clsid:02BF25D5-8C17-4B23-BC80-D3488ABDDC6B\" codebase=\"http:\/\/www.apple.com\/qtactivex\/qtplugin.cab\" height=\"264\" width=\"470\">\n<param name=\"src\" value=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/visceral_video.mov\">\n<param name=\"autoplay\" value=\"false\">\n<param name=\"controller\" value=\"true\">\n<embed height=\"264\" width=\"470\" src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/visceral_video.mov\" pluginspage=\"http:\/\/www.apple.com\/quicktime\/download\/\" type=\"video\/quicktime\" controller=\"true\" autoplay=\"false\" scale=\"tofit\">\n<\/object><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Logo animation.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>To add to this story, we have some early sketches of the X-Ray idea to be able to see how things evolve from initial presentation to final execution.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/visceral_x-ray_sketches.jpg\" alt=\"Visceral Games Logo, X-Ray Sketches\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Some of the early sketches for the X-Ray concept.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/visceral_sketches_01.gif\" alt=\"Visceral Games Logo, Sketches\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/visceral_sketches_02.gif\" alt=\"Visceral Games Logo, Sketches\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/visceral_sketches_03.gif\" alt=\"Visceral Games Logo, Sketches\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Some early <em>early<\/em> sketches of the design process.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[66,12,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/850"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=850"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/850\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=850"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=850"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=850"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
