These are my best and worst and they don&#8217;t represent the comments on each of the original posts, whether positive or negative. Other than the first item in each category (my favorite and my least favorite) the selections are in no particular order. I&#8217;ll take this opportunity too, to thank everyone that visits Brand New &mdash; every single month of 2008 our readership increases &mdash; and for all of you that send us tips, we would literally not have the great content we have if it weren&#8217;t for your contributions. Posting will be light for the next two weeks. Enjoy your Holidays and have a happy new year.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/2008_best.gif\" alt=\"2008 Best List\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/826_Office_logo.gif\" alt=\"Best and Worst, 2008\" \/><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pirates_the_best_target_audien.php\"><strong>826 Valencia<\/strong><\/a> \/ <strong>Top Honor<\/strong> \/ This project has unfair advantage against most on this site &mdash; it has a visionary and design-savvy leader in Dave Eggers &mdash; and it doesn&#8217;t involve the risks that most corporations or brands face but, damn, is it awesome. And as far as I can remember, this is the only post in the history of Brand New that has come close to 100% positive remarks.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/taca_logo.gif\" alt=\"Best and Worst, 2008\" \/><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/a_new_eagle_for_taca.php\"><strong>TACA<\/strong><\/a> \/ Probably the best new icon of the year, either as a representation of an eagle or a guacamaya.

And, it&#8217;s actually a vibrant and cohesive identity.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/camel_pack.jpg\" alt=\"Best and Worst, 2008\" \/><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_camels_new_clothes.php\"><strong>Camel<\/strong><\/a> \/ Because it&#8217;s a project that most designers would scoff at, and it&#8217;s one of the best packaging redesigns in a while that actually advances the brand.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mouse_logo.gif\" alt=\"Best and Worst, 2008\" \/><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_roaring_mouse.php\"><strong>Mouse Awards<\/strong><\/a> \/ Sure, the old logo was barely a logo and pretty much impossible to screw up on the rebrand, yet this is an adorable and clever new logo.

I guess that speaks volumes to the lack of appropriateness for this change. <\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ab-inbev_logo.jpg\" alt=\"Best and Worst, 2008\" \/><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/global_beer.php\"><strong>Anheuser-Busch InBev<\/strong><\/a> \/ A missed opportunity to create something that didn&#8217;t look like it came from istockphoto.com.
