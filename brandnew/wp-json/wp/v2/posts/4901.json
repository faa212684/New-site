There is absolutely no reason why this logo should work and maybe to some it doesn&#8217;t but it plays off of the name (which doesn&#8217;t make much sense to begin with) wonderfully, with just enough effort it&#8217;s perfectly readable, and as impossible as it may be it&#8217;s masterfully typeset. The additional spinning of the letters in animated form takes it up to 11 in the absurd scale and makes me like it even more. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bedow.se\/work\/identity\/terri-timely-identity\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Bouquet by Eszter Laki<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_bouquet.jpg\" alt=\"Bouquet by Eszter Laki\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bellevue-gstaad.ch\/restaurant-bars\/bouquet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bouquet<\/a> is a night-time bar in the Grand Bellevue hotel in the ski resort town of Gstaad in the Swiss Alps, whose decor is completely covered in floral patterns. Bouquet&#8217;s new logo by Budapest, Hungary-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/lakieszti\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Eszter Laki<\/a> sets the tone for a naughty night out with a burlesque lady&#8217;s legs supporting a giant torso bouquet of flowers and a &#8220;bq&#8221; monogram that&#8217;s half-part sophisticated, half-part 69 (or as Eszter more delicately puts it, it refers &#8220;delicately to the joy of mutual pleasures&#8221;). The charming logo is complemented by a lovely, all-lowercase, formal script wordmark that clashes in a great way with the overwrought lady illustration. The identity is airy and simple with great production and lovely hints of red in the edging of the coasters and business cards and the lining on the menus. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/42023157\/Bouquet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Sally Beauty (Mexico) by Anagrama<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_sallybeauty.jpg\" alt=\"Sally Beauty (Mexico) by Anagrama\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.sallybeautyholdings.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sally Beauty<\/a> is one of the largest retailers of professional beauty supplies in the world, with over 5,000 stores.

The elements are very simple and bare &#8212; a sans serif wordmark, a red smear of lipstick, and black and white photography &#8212; but, as usual, Anagrama brings them together with great balance and contrast. <a href=\"http:\/\/anagrama.com\/portafolio\/231-sally-beauty\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Black and white with hints of red permeate this week&apos;s projects with work from Stockholm, Budapest, and Monterrey&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[175,1307,149],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4901"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4901"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4901\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4901"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4901"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4901"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
