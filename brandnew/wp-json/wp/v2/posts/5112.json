With the cannabis products we are seeing a free-for-all in terms of visual approach since there is no benchmark or established tropes for all this new packaging so if one of these companies wants to have a crest with deer wearing chokers and an eagle on a crown then it makes perfect sense. Designed by Saint Paul, MN-based <a href=\"http:\/\/wdw.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Werner Design Werks<\/a>, the crest and packaging pull off the <em>high<\/em>-jinks in the crest, the name, and the overall opulence through a restrained, elegant execution and a crisp, energetic color palette of green, orange, blue, white, black, and gold. The body lotion packaging works a lot better, with the crest wrapping around the box and more vertical white space to contrast with it. Still, the lotion and chocolate seem like a good one-two combo for a relaxing time. <a href=\"http:\/\/wdw.com\/projects\/lord-jones\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a> <\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Shower Beer by Snask<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_showerbeer.jpg\" alt=\"Shower Beer by Snask\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">Leave it to Stockholm-based <a href=\"http:\/\/snask.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Snask<\/a> to come up with a preposterous concept as this and make it look as good as it does: their own beer, meant to be drank IN the shower in only three sips. Brewed by their long-time client <a href=\"http:\/\/pangpangbrewery.se\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PangPang Brewery<\/a>, Shower Beer is a pale ale that comes in an 18-centiliter, small bottle &#8212; the equivalent of 12 tablespoons &#8212; with a pink cap. The typography is refreshingly not Arial or something to make it look more hipster than the idea already is and the proportion of the whole thing is totally adorable and I love that &#8220;foam&#8221; is an identity element. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/46393235\/Shower-Beer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Sans &amp; Sans by Requena<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_sansandsans.jpg\" alt=\"Sans &amp; Sans by Requena\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.sansisans.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sans &amp; Sans<\/a> in Barcelona, Spain, is a retailer of teas, offering a range of classics as well as their own concoctions.

The image above shows two separate ranges of teas, the classics and some special editions teas, that all maintain a consistent aesthetic even with when they use disparate graphic elements.
