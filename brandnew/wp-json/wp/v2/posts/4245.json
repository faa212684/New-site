Asana, which is Sanskrit for &#8220;yoga pose&#8221;, has a solid pedigree as one of its co-founders was co-founder of Facebook and the other can claim credit to inventing Facebook&#8217;s &#8220;Like&#8221; button.

[&hellip;] Three dots used to patiently wait in line at the deli counter, but now they&#8217;re working together on a common goal. Instead of a cool green, they&#8217;re now an empowering, warm coral, with a glow that conveys the active energy between the team. The letter forms, placement, and arrangement of our logo were crafted with purpose. If you look closely, you&#8217;ll notice that there are three dots equally spaced inside the &#8220;A&#8221; letters in our word mark.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.asana.com\/2015\/10\/teamwork-is-beautiful-introducing-asanas-new-look\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Asana blog post<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/asana_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Asana done In-house with Moving Brands\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/asana_logo_construction_01.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Asana done In-house with Moving Brands\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/asana_logo_construction_02.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Asana done In-house with Moving Brands\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo construction.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo was really bad. It had good intentions but the typography &mdash; I&#8217;m looking at you &#8220;n&#8221; &mdash; was very amateur and the three dots were like a decorative after-thought. The new logo amazingly manages to take the core elements and ideas behind the old logo to make a beautiful new one. (Which demonstrates that ideas aren&#8217;t that great without proper execution.)<\/p>\n<p>The three dots are now the centerpiece of the logo and, although they are rather unassuming in their static form, when you see the video at the end of the post you might be swooning over them. The subtle gradient creates a very clever glow that makes the dots look as if they are emanating good vibes. The typography is also a great improvement with the three single-story &#8220;a&#8221;s now containing three dots of their own. I normally criticize (negatively) custom wordmarks where stems are notched in some way but here is an example that I find works properly and nicely, breaking the otherwise geometric nature of the letterforms.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/asana_digital_presence.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Asana done In-house with Moving Brands\" \/>\n<figcaption>Digital presence.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/asana_ui.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Asana done In-house with Moving Brands\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sample UI animation boosts when you complete tasks.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/140693423\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Introduction to Asana.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">The same lightness and airiness of the logo has been applied to the user interface &mdash; or, most likely, the other way around.
