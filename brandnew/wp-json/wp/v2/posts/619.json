At first glance, the call sign is unembellished as four distinct letters&#8230;but with a twist. I am inclined to guess that these blocks are a clever attempt at fusing a skyline of buildings with the LDC volume readout of a boom box. Those thick red bars seem more likely to blast Van Halen &#038; Howard Stern rather than Rachmaninov &#038; Leonard Lopate. But who says we shouldn&#8217;t rock out to the latter?
