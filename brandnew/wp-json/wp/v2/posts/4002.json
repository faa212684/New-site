The identity by local form <a href=\"http:\/\/acre.sg\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ACRE<\/a> is so vibrant it basically has a pulsating soundtrack of its own. There is a bunch of reasons why I shouldn&#8217;t like this, yet I find it mesmerizing and it&#8217;s also perfectly appropriate for the client and audience. The 7-spoke icon is quite nice and I like how it animates as an expression of cycling. The main hook on the application is that some of the items are printed in neon ink that glows in ultraviolet light. Sure, it&#8217;s a gimmick, but it&#8217;s a cool gimmick. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/26394565\/7Cycle-(Branding)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Oliver Dogwood Floral by The McQaudes<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_oliverdogwood.jpg\" alt=\"Oliver Dogwood Floral by The McQaudes\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.oliverdogwoodfloral.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Oliver Dogwood Floral<\/a> is a floral studio in Chicago, IL, creating fresh floral and botanical arrangements for all kinds of events. The identity by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.themcquades.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The McQuades<\/a> is pretty much everything you would expect a high-end floral studio to look like but it&#8217;s done so well and so&hellip; botanically that it&#8217;s not easy to dismiss. The &#8220;O&#8221; monogram comes in very realistic and more abstract renderings, both working nicely in tandem to convey the freshness and rustic-ness of the company. The logo placed on the slabs of wood with the scattered green leaves is like the ultimate Pinterest-bait. Just all around enjoyable without too much overthinking or over-designing. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.themcquades.com\/oliverdogwood\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Chez Dodo by Eszter Laki<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_chezdodo.jpg\" alt=\"Chez Dodo by Eszter Laki\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/chezdodomacaron\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Chez Dodo<\/a> is a small purveyor of macarons in Budapest run by D&oacute;ri Szalai, who happens to own a blouse with a pattern of hummingbirds that served as the inspiration for this identity by local designer <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/lakieszti\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Eszter Laki<\/a>, who recreated the pattern in watercolor. While the typography and layouts are fine &mdash; there is a macaron CD monogram not pictured above that&#8217;s a delight &mdash; what I love the most about this is the unrelenting use of the hummingbird pattern. It&#8217;s everywhere. It&#8217;s on the business cards, outside the boxes, inside the boxes, on carry-out bags, and even on the wall. Unexpected and charming. <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/23053239\/CHEZ-DODO\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/strong><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"From techno vibes and neon colors to soothing vibes and earthy colors, we have something for whatever mood you are in with work from Singapore, Chicago, and Budapest&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[1065,1125,1162],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4002"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4002"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4002\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4002"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4002"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4002"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
