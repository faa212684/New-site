Their most recent effort is a DIY HIV test that is free, anonymous and easy-to-use at home, which complements their other services that include a chat support, workshops, and community outreach. At the end of 2016, Helseutvalget introduced a new logo, with the identity been rolling out over the course of 2017, designed by Oslo, Norway-based <a href=\"http:\/\/bielkeyang.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bielke&amp;Yang<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>Because they work with sexual health and issues that are perceived as very personal, it&#8217;s important that their services also are relevant to those who don&#8217;t necessarily live openly as gay or lesbian. These were the main reasons behind their rebranding; a refresh of their visual identity, website and printed materials, and gathering all initiatives under one profile. They wanted a modern, welcoming expression, lowering the threshold for contact&#8211;and hoping to achieve this through a more a more inclusive and friendly identity.<br \/><br \/>With this in mind, when developing the new visual identity we wanted to focus on interaction and dialogue between people. The new logo symbol shows two people who care for and love each other, while forming an H for Helseutvalget. This visual expression has been developed further in the form of secondary icons and animations, sub-initiative logos, and the different steps of Helseutvalgets new HIV-test in close collaboration with Dutch illustrator Hedof. The illustrations add a playfulness to content perceived as difficult and personal. The new visual identity is flexible enough to be used in corporate situations as well as festivals like Oslo Pride or similar events.<\/blockquote><h3>Bielke&amp;Yang provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/helseutvalget_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Helseutvalget by Bielke&amp;Yang\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/helseutvalget_logo_colors.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Helseutvalget by Bielke&amp;Yang\" \/>\n<figcaption>Service variations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo had all the subtlety of an anthropomorphic condom with a bow tie running excitedly. To its credit, it was somewhat charming but it didn&#8217;t quite inspire confidence or trust, much less portray a serious organization devoted to an important cause. The new logo features a fantastic icon\/monogram that displays an &#8220;H&#8221; made up of two figures hugging (also, possibly and most likely, shagging) and it&#8217;s great. It instantly creates a sense of connection and care, amplified by the soft, pink human tones. The wordmark is simple but has a few quirks (the &#8220;g&#8221; and &#8220;a&#8221; curl a little more than usual) that make it different from the usual sans serif.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/helseutvalget_identity_elements.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Helseutvalget by Bielke&amp;Yang\" \/>\n<figcaption>Identity elements.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/helseutvalget_icons.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Helseutvalget by Bielke&amp;Yang\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icons.
