The described intended audience is a &#8220;25 &ndash; 50-year-old outdoor enthusiast who is cosmopolitan, physically active and aesthetically driven.&#8221; And is rich, or has a subscription to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.monocle.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Monocle<\/em><\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><p>Recession-induced sarcasm aside, this is a very appropriate and nicely executed identity, designed by New York based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.carbonesmolan.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Carbone Smolan<\/a>, that fits perfectly with the clothing design and the intended audience. The icon is meant to evoke &#8220;infinity and clouds circling a mountain peak&#8221; and supports the lofty name of Aether, which can poetically mean &#8220;the heavens&#8221; or at the very least, the air and space above and beyond the clouds. The icon is simple and sophisticated and the way it impossibly loops and connects is very pleasing; it also almost looks like a cult logo, something obscure that only a few can attain &mdash; and with those prices, it sure strives for that. The typography conveys a very upscale feel as well and is perfectly letterspaced; if I had one objection it would be that the weight of the type is <em>almost<\/em> like the weight of the icon, just slightly bolder, so my inclination would have been to make them exactly the same. The all-black applications are a welcome change from all the bubbly and friendly colors we&#8217;ve been seeing in branding lately, so it&#8217;s nice to see a company go for it. Aether Apparel may not be for everyone and the identity helps establish that distancing from the conventional.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/aether_01.jpg\" alt=\"Aether Apparel, Applications\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/aether_02.jpg\" alt=\"Aether Apparel, Applications\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/aether_03.jpg\" alt=\"Aether Apparel, Applications\" \/><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_22090720_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_22090720_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_22090720_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_22090720_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[51,12,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/882"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=882"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/882\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=882"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=882"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=882"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
