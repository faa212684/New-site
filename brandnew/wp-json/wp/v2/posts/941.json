This past month, before Apple came into the picture, the owner of Woolworths, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.progressive.co.nz\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Progressive Enterprises<\/a>, announced that another one of its grocery store brands, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.countdown.co.nz\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Countdown<\/a>, would be <a href=\"http:\/\/www.stuff.co.nz\/business\/industries\/2886572\/Foodtown-Woolworths-NZ-brands-to-be-phased-out\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">replacing the Woolworths name across Australia and New Zealand<\/a>, leaving the stylized &#8220;W&#8221; devoid of its double-u-ness. Then, at some point in the last twelve months <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theage.com.au\/business\/apple-bites-over-woolworths-logo-20091005-ghzr.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Apple has decided to contest the trademark application<\/a> of Woolworths\/Countdown with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ipaustralia.gov.au\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">IP Australia<\/a>, the government agency that handles trademarks. One of Apple&#8217;s main concerns was that Woolworths wants to cover all possible categories including &#8220;electrical goods and technology.&#8221; Even though you are more likely to find Woolworths-branded napkins at their store, Apple still feels threatened by this logo which, in my mind, is a whole other kind of logo and Apple should keep their attorneys busy with something else.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"red\">Update:<\/span><\/strong> Apologies, I got some facts wrong. Countdown is replacing Woolworths <em>only<\/em> in New Zealand <em>not<\/em> Australia. Also, Woolworths Limited owns the Woolworths chain <em>and<\/em> Progressive Enterprises as its New Zealand subsidiary, which in turn owns Countdown.
