Its mission is to &#8220;build the infrastructure that technology and innovation entrepreneurs need to be successful&#8221; and prompt them to &#8220;launch and accelerate companies to create jobs and increase wages.&#8221; The Mill is housed in a stunning 19,000-square-foot, 103-year-old renovated building that used to be part of the Showers Brothers Company&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/photos.wikimapia.org\/p\/00\/05\/41\/45\/56_big.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">massive plant<\/a> and now accommodates dozens of members on temporary and dedicated desks, private offices, and shared conference rooms as well as opening its doors to the public for community-building, skills-focused seminars, and educational and member-driven events every month. We started working on their identity at the start of 2018 when the building was still being gutted and were thrilled to have been part of this effort leading to The Mill&#8217;s launch in October 2018.<\/p>\n<!--more--><p><span class=\"red\">Nota bene:<\/span> Under normal circumstances, given the size of the client, this project would have been possibly posted in the Noted section if it had not been designed by us.

The building has eight sawtooth roof segments and, as luck would have it, so does the name &#8220;The Mill&#8221; (if you count the space).<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/The_Mill_case_study_logo_primary.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for The Mill by UnderConsideration\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo, primary.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The logo serves to distinguish The Mill from other co-working spaces around the country by focusing on its space and work ethic: The shape of the logo is a simplified abstraction of their iconic building and the eight sawtooth partitions on its roof that equal the eight characters in their name while the typography is bold, industrious, and determined, like the many innovators, remote workers, entrepreneurs, and creators that occupy The Mill.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/The_Mill_case_study_logo_secondary.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for The Mill by UnderConsideration\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo, secondary.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Given the wide length of the primary logo we created a secondary logo to use as social media avatars and in other instances where horizontal real estate is limited. The secondary logo zooms in on one of the roof segments &#8212; while implying that the building continues to the right &#8212; and rearranges the wordmark in a stacked configuration.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video controls loop controlsList=\"nodownload\" poster=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/The_Mill_case_study_logo_primary_to_secondary_animation.jpg\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/The_Mill_case_study_logo_primary_to_secondary_animation.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Primary to secondary logo animation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/The_Mill_case_study_logo_alternates_a.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for The Mill by UnderConsideration\" \/>\n<figcaption>Alternates.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>For added flexibility we also created building-less logos to use in special circumstances &#8212; like the signs on the exterior of the building (shown way below) where having the building shape is redundant. Additionally, these variations can be amended with &#8220;Bloomington, IN&#8221; for cases where communications are targeted to people outside the city. In another stroke of character-count luck, we were able to fit every other character of the city right in between each of the characters of the wordmark.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/The_Mill_case_study_color_palette.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for The Mill by UnderConsideration\" \/>\n<figcaption>Color palette.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The color palette is extracted from the furniture and fixtures found inside The Mill &#8212; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/The_Mill_case_study_color_palette_irl.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">here is an example<\/a>. These provide a calm but confident palette that complements pictures of the exterior and interior of the building.
