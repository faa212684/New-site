With a legacy that dates back to the 1830s when the  tracks to the route were laid, the company introduced a new identity &mdash; and name change &mdash; designed by London-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pentagram.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pentagram<\/a> partner John Rushworth that would link it to its history and position it for its future improvements.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>Inspired by the legacy of Brunel, the new branding is a modern adaptation of the traditional Great Western Railway look and feel, drawing on its 182-year-old heritage to inspire a new identity. As part of the new look, travelers will soon be able to see refreshed branding, new uniforms and the phased introduction of new train liveries.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.gwr.com\/about-us\/media-centre\/news\/2015\/september\/first-great-western-becomes-great-western-railway-as-part-of-historic-re-brand\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GWR press release<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/great_western_rail_logo_detail.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Great Western Railway by Pentagram\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo render detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The previous name and logo were amazingly cheap-looking and cheap-sounding. &#8220;First Great Western&#8221; &mdash; to a foreigner not familiar with the UK&#8217;s railway system &mdash; sounds like a bank and the logo didn&#8217;t do much to indicate this was a significant transport option. Sure, the &#8220;f&#8221; monogram has perspective to look like a track going into the distance but the magenta color didn&#8217;t quite scream &#8220;train&#8221;. The new logo aims to capture the spirit of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=first+great+western+livery&#038;es_sm=91&#038;source=lnms&#038;tbm=isch&#038;sa=X&#038;ved=0CAcQ_AUoAWoVChMIz7nkm-_VyAIVi4wNCh0e2A3b&#038;biw=1446&#038;bih=866#tbm=isch&#038;q=gwr+vintage+logo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the vintage GWR monogram<\/a> but without just rehashing it. Instead it provides a simple, bold, and elegant logo that looks like it belongs as easily in the nineteenth century as it does in the twenty-first. At first, the proportion of the &#8220;W&#8221; is distracting but once you see it on the side of trains it simply works.<\/p>\n<blockquote>&#8220;The initial brief was very good, it was part of First&#8217;s rebidding for the franchise,&#8221; says Rushworth. &#8220;It was all about the &#8216;renaissance of rail&#8217; &hellip; putting pride back into the sector, but in a way that was tangible and believable rather than it just being about &mdash; let&#8217;s say &mdash; a coat of paint. We wanted to make sure that it was delivered as a modern, contemporary railway company, relevant to rail travel and travellers today, but obviously one that was conscious of its history,&#8221; he says. &#8220;You shouldn&#8217;t walk away from your history, you should always celebrate it.<br \/><br \/>&#8220;That said, we took the attitude that the new visual identity would be appropriate if it felt like this had been in continuum from the days of when the Great Western Railway was valued but that, through natural evolution, this is where it had ended up.&#8221;<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.creativereview.co.uk\/cr-blog\/2015\/september\/the-rebirth-of-the-great-western-railway\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Creative Review story<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/great_western_rail_logo_sparks.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Great Western Railway by Pentagram\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo being built for a train.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/great_western_rail_logo_sparks_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Great Western Railway by Pentagram\" \/>\n<figcaption>More!
