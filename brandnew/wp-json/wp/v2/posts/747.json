Then, with the swirl of the Holidays and the craziness of trying to finish things before and around them, I just kind of forgot. A couple of days ago, while grocery shopping with my parents and the rest of the Vit clan in a grocery store five or forty-three times bigger than our Brooklyn Key Food, the new Truvia packaging literally stopped me in my tracks as I reached for my own preferred sweetener (Splenda).<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/truvia_aisle.jpg\" alt=\"Truvia Packaging, Aisle\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Sweetener aisle in a Houston, TX grocery store.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/blog.pentagram.com\/2008\/12\/new-work-truvia.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">At Pentagram&#8217;s <em>New<\/em> section you can see the full identity, packaging and explanation in handsomely photographed images<\/a>. &#8220;Truvia&trade; is designed,&#8221; reads one of the captions on those images, &#8220;to stand out from the competition.&#8221; It&#8217;s the kind of thing that designers love to write as a selling point in client presentations or as bragging points in press releases. However, in this case, Truvia actually (and literally) stands out from the competition. I&#8217;m not sure if the photograph above manages to capture the stark contrast but, in person, Truvia&#8217;s presence is remarkable. In a flood of swirls, gradients and glowing typography, the simplicity of Truvia is the sweetest of them all.<\/p>\n<p>My favorite part of the packaging is the typography, it feels very light and fresh, and the overlapping effect is rather nice. I could do without the leafy dot over the &#8220;i&#8221;. First because it&#8217;s just too leafy and second because it makes it look like an accent, and for a Spanish-speaking person like myself I would want to pronounce the name as Tru-veeeee-ah, instead of Tru-vyah. Truth be told, I don&#8217;t even know how I&#8217;m supposed to pronounce it, but the accent doesn&#8217;t help. The choice of the strawberry is visually interesting too, as it creates a great, um, accent in the green and white box. Overall, this is a bold statement on the part of Truvia, to realize that they needed to really stand out within the crowded category in order to be able to make quick impact.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Disclaimer in case anyone needs it: I used to work for Pentagram.
