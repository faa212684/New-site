Headquartered in Berlin, Germany, and Barcelona, Spain, Wind offers its services in more than 20 cities including operations in Germany, France, Spain, Israel, Austria, Portugal, Denmark, Korea, and Japan. Wind recently unveiled its third-generation scooter, disclosed $50 million in Series A funding, and introduced a new identity designed by London, UK-based <a href=\"https:\/\/raggededge.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ragged Edge<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><p><strong>Side note:<\/strong> I am still waiting on assets for the Android review. It should be happening soon so don&#8217;t lose hope! (Or patience.)<\/p>\n<blockquote>Positioning Wind e-scooters as a secret super power, [Ragged Edge] created a vibrant new visual and verbal identity to cut through a rapidly growing category. And just as every superhero has its arch nemesis, Wind has identified travel misery as the &#8216;villian&#8217; it seeks to defeat.<br \/><br \/>Wind&#8217;s new look and feel is evocative of the comics of the past, and aims to empower its customers to be the &#8216;everyday hero&#8217; of their city. The bold new look also matches Wind&#8217;s recently-launched hardware &#8212; an in-house designed scooter that was crafted specifically for the sharing market.<\/blockquote><h3>Ragged Edge provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/wind_mobility_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Wind Mobility by Ragged Edge\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/wind_mobility_logo_animation.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Wind Mobility by Ragged Edge\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo animation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/wind_mobility_icon.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Wind Mobility by Ragged Edge\" \/>\n<figcaption>Monogram.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo was passable, breaking down the name into circles punctuated by a fifth one showing an icon of an electric scooter. Every detail could have been a little bit better or more interesting but, also, there was nothing terrible about it, other than, perhaps, the unnecessary stenciling of the &#8220;D&#8221;. The new logo is more literal about the name, making it the type look as if it&#8217;s zooming so fast the wind is blowing through it at top speeds. It&#8217;s a little corny but I appreciate the stark asymmetry of it and willingness to be very different. The spiky serifs on the &#8220;W&#8221; and &#8220;N&#8221; are odd but they sort of work. I&#8217;m not sure I like the logo but I certainly don&#8217;t dislike it. The monogram, when you try to read it as a &#8220;W&#8221; looks like it&#8217;s floating too much but after you stare at it for a while and begin to see it as an abstract graphic it starts to look more interesting as a line zig-zagging through the city.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/wind_mobility_old_scooters.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Wind Mobility by Ragged Edge\" \/>\n<figcaption>Old scooters.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/wind_mobility_key_visual.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Wind Mobility by Ragged Edge\" \/>\n<figcaption>Hero image.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/wind_mobility_scooter_detail_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Wind Mobility by Ragged Edge\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/wind_mobility_scooter_detail_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Wind Mobility by Ragged Edge\" \/>\n<figcaption>Scooter details.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old scooters were not very exciting, especially in contrast to the new bold and yellow scooters that will be impossible to not notice on the streets. The name wraps nicely along the front bar and the monogram looks pretty great on the back wheel. The accent teal handles are a nice touch but the light color, in due time, is going to look all ugly and grimy after hundreds of uses&#8230; I would have kept those dark blue for consistency and appearance of cleanliness.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/embed\/feed\/update\/urn:li:ugcPost:6564155586953428993?compact=1\" height=\"284\" width=\"504\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" title=\"Embedded post\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>New look introduction video, done by Wind (not Ragged Edge).<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/wind_mobility_logo_cities.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Wind Mobility by Ragged Edge\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/wind_mobility_type_behaviors.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Wind Mobility by Ragged Edge\" \/>\n<figcaption>Typography.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/wind_mobility_posters.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Wind Mobility by Ragged Edge\" \/>\n<figcaption>Posters.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The superhero\/superpower narrative is a little trite but I&#8217;ll admit that it at least gives the scooter brand <em>a<\/em> narrative, as opposed to other scooter brands that just <em>are<\/em>. I think they could have turned it up a notch without going full comic as it feels somewhat shy on the superhero language. I do like the big typography with the hard shadows in different colors and how the scooter gets integrated. I wouldn&#8217;t stick my neck out to defend the identity&#8217;s honor but it&#8217;s all mostly fine and visually engaging at a glance.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/wind_mobility_app_screens.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>App screens.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/wind_mobility_digital_ad.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Digital ad.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/wind_mobility_tshirt.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Wind Mobility by Ragged Edge\" \/>\n<figcaption>T-shirt.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/wind_mobility_hat.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Wind Mobility by Ragged Edge\" \/>\n<figcaption>Cap.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/wind_mobility_hq.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Wind Mobility by Ragged Edge\" \/>\n<figcaption>Place of business.

Hard to tell how long-lasting the superhero theme will endure or even if it will be well received but at least it&#8217;s attempting a new approach in the sector.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 2017, Wind Mobility (Wind for short), is a &quot;micro-mobility share company&quot; that offers &quot;easy access to short distance transportation in urban areas&quot; &#8212; in other words, another scooter company.
