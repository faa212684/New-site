See proof below for how hard we&#8217;ve working in the sweltering Texas heat.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bnconf_2015_update_masks.jpg\" alt=\"2015 Brand New Conference: Update\" \/>\n<figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"http:\/\/spencerhuddleston.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Spencer Huddleston<\/a> who lent a very needed helping hand.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p><span class=\"red_100\">4) Attendee geography<\/span><br \/> We have <a href=\"http:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnewconference\/who_is_attending.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">655 attendees<\/a> so far and we are delighted with this number at this point. Our goal is 800 and we hope we can make it happen. We obviously have a big crowd from New York state at 154. Other states contributing are: 45 from California, 25 from Illinois, 20 from Pennsylvania, and 14 from New Jersey. Over 100 people are coming from outside the U.S.! From Antwerp, Calgary, Dubai, Guatemala, Hong Kong, Lima, London, Lyon, Melbourne, Moscow, Prague, Stockholm, Toronto, Vancouver, and more. We love this.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"red_100\">5) Ticket giveaway<\/span><br \/> On Monday, August 31, we will be doing our usual ticket giveaway courtesy of sponsors who may have unused tickets and our matching giveaway.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"red_100\">6) Last day for online registration<\/span><br \/> Finally, a reminder that online registration for both in-person tickets and webcast will close September 17. Walk-in registrations will be accepted. This is especially important for people considering the webcast. We will not accept any registrations after this date.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"We are 50 days away from the 2015 Brand New Conference and have a few updates and notes to share: 1) After-party The venue for the after-party will be the groovy M1-5 Bar &amp; Lounge.
