Known as the &#8220;Desi Burger&#8221;, the dish has been Americanized to a degree, being served with cheese and ketchup, but Majja is making sure to serve it traditionally across its first eight locations in Ahmedabad, with plans to grow to other cities. The identity for the restaurant has been designed by Gurgaon, India-based <a href=\"http:\/\/nh1design.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NH1 Design<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>The word &#8216;Majja&#8217; (fun) is commonly used across India. We created a fun verbal brand language that could be easily understood across different languages and cultures. A friendly tone of voice that completely aligned with the brand ethos.<br \/><br \/>The use of illustrated stories of people and the streets of Mumbai further emphasised the authenticity of the vada pavs. Together the visual and verbal language established a consistent set of assets for the brand.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/nh1design.com\/work\/majja\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NH1 Design project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/majja_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Majja by NH1 Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>It is so nice to see a completely different typographic aesthetic for a logo other than traditional serif and sans serifs with the choice of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.myfonts.com\/fonts\/ruben-dias\/taca\/?refby=ucllc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Taca<\/a> by R\u00faben R Dias. The almost primitive structure and aesthetic of this wordmark is fun, bold, engaging, and differentiating. The stacked &#8220;j&#8221;s is both a great move to avoid the kerning issue that would have resulted from leaving them on the same baseline and it adds rhythm and bounce to the wordmark.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/majja_logo_new_full.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Majja by NH1 Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Full logo. &#8220;Fun New Life&#8221;.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/majja_logo_verbal_01.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Majja by NH1 Design\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/majja_logo_verbal_02.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Majja by NH1 Design\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/majja_logo_verbal_03.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Majja by NH1 Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Verbal variations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The logo is paired with speech bubbles that complement majja, which means &#8220;fun&#8221;, and while some (if not most) are lost on both literal and cultural translation to me, the point is clear that the name has a lot of flexibility and playfulness. I kind of like the handwritten, scripty font used, although it would have been nice if it had contextual alternates. The secondary variations with the wobbly uppercase and logo inside a speech bubble are not as elegant as the others but do work well paired with the illustrations.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/majja_illustrations_01.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Majja by NH1 Design\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/majja_illustrations_02.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Majja by NH1 Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Illustration style.

I&#8217;m particularly fond of the logo on the napkins&#8230; not sure what it is, but I just keep coming back to it and enjoying how it looks. The cups with the repeating logos and speech bubbles also look great and the paper wrappers with the illustration make for a great distraction while you eat your vada pav.

The illustrations would have looked great on a white background. Still, it&#8217;s a nice, business-y extension of the consumer aesthetic.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/majja_location_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Majja by NH1 Design\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/majja_location_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Majja by NH1 Design\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/majja_location_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Majja by NH1 Design\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/majja_location_04.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Majja by NH1 Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Store.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The brick and mortar restaurants, in their limited square footage, do a good job in making the best of their space and branding pretty much every space available, including the vent fan in the back of the kitchen.
