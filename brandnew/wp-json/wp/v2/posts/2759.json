The spray dots, lines, and squiggles aren&#8217;t totally gratuitous either: if you go to their website your cursor will transform into all of them and you can also see <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cocolia.cat\/en\/see\/project\/41\/FURNITURE-COCOLIA-2013\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">furniture<\/a> spray painted with the same motifs. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cocolia.cat\/en\/see\/project\/53\/BRAND-IDENTITY-COCOLIA-2013\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Maio by TwoPoints.Net<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_maio.jpg\" alt=\"Maio by TwoPoints.Net\"\/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">This flexible identity system by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.twopoints.net\/en\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TwoPoints.Net<\/a> for architecture firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.maio-maio.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Maio<\/a> is deployed on three different rolls of tape, all featuring patterns of the logo and the company&#8217;s information so that any piece of paper can be turned into a letterhead, business card, or postcard. (I wish we could see actual photos on TwoPoints.net&#8217;s case study instead of renderings).

Launched in 2009, Super3 is a Spanish public television channel for kids and teenagers broadcast in Catalan. A couple of years ago, motion graphics shop <a href=\"http:\/\/www.diestro.tv\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Diestro<\/a> was tasked with bringing the identity to 3D awesomeness. As much as this is likely not my (or most&#8217;s) style, the result is as energetic as an 8-year-old jumping on his or her bed right before bedtime. (Conversely, it can also be annoying). This is unapologetically 3D-ish with the logo doing every possible visual summersault to get attention. And it works. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.diestro.tv\/works\/17\/club-super-3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Today we get a full dose of Catalan-ness with work from designers in Barcelona for clients in Barcelona&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[953,954,290,429],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2759"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2759"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2759\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2759"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2759"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2759"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
