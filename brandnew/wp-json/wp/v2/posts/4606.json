Loqueleo is sort of an evolution of Alfaguara Infantil, established in 1977, as it inherits all of its original titles after Alfaguara was sold to Penguin Random House in 2014 and will be available in over 20 countries. The name can be translated as What I Read or &#8220;whatiread&#8221; and its new identity has been designed by Madrid-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pepcarrio.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pep Carri\u00f3<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/loqueleo_logo.png\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Loqueleo by Pep Carri\u00f3\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.

The new logo is super charming, with a very playful lowercase wordmark that has the exaggerated spurs that give it a great rhythm. Even the uppercase &#8220;Q&#8221; wedged in among the lowercase letters fits in perfectly. The logo comes in two configurations: the first, shown in the header image, where the &#8220;o&#8221; in the name is underlined with an abstract book graphic; and the second, shown in the logo detail, where the &#8220;o&#8221; and book underline are pulled out as an icon, leaving the wordmark without the decoration. Both work great and the book graphic is super simple and reads perfectly as a book; it&#8217;s also nice to see something with curves and not just the monoweight Adobe Illustrator effect.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/loqueleo_stationery.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Loqueleo by Pep Carri\u00f3\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stationery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/loqueleo_envelopes.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Loqueleo by Pep Carri\u00f3\" \/>\n<figcaption>Envelopes.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/loqueleo_letterhead.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Loqueleo by Pep Carri\u00f3\" \/>\n<figcaption>Letterhead.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/loqueleo_something.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Loqueleo by Pep Carri\u00f3\" \/>\n<figcaption>Backs of something.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The applications are Corporate Identity 101 and I mean that in a good way.

A little dry but they get the job done. The cropped &#8220;O&#8221; that bleeds into the spine with the color-coded bar shooting out of it feels off-brand but I guess it makes for a good spine presence on the shelf with the black and white bars running parallel.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/loqueleo_bookkeeping.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Loqueleo by Pep Carri\u00f3\" \/>\n<figcaption>Book notebook.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/loqueleo_posters.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Loqueleo by Pep Carri\u00f3\" \/>\n<figcaption>Posters.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/QPoKo0w1bvk\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Introduction to Loqueleo. The opening part of the video has a cute premise in that it&#8217;s talking about three different age groups and for each person they are saying that &#8220;So and so just turned 13 books old&#8221; or &#8220;She is older than him, at 73 books old&#8221;, replacing books for years, extending the idea that we are what we read.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">In addition to the more corporate side there is a promotional aspect to the identity where lively illustrations pop out from books in photos or the book graphic and it&#8217;s a great way to extend the idea of books coming to life and kids becoming part of the story. Overall, this is a lovely and appropriate new brand, from name to logo to applications.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in late 2015, Loqueleo is a new imprint from Santillana &#8212; the leading textbook publishing group in Spain and Latin America &#8212; focused on children and young adult books.
