Of these, unfortunately, there aren&#8217;t too many that really stand out &mdash; they all seem to blend together for some reason. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.chilis.com\/\">Chili&#8217;s<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/tgifridays.com\/index.htm\">T.G.I. Friday&#8217;s<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rubytuesdays.com\/\">Ruby Tuesdays<\/a> (yes, they have a new logo too, to be reviewed here soon), and, the cause of this post, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.applebees.com\/\">Appleebee&#8217;s<\/a>, are only a few of them. They all have roughly the same vast menu, same average price, and same lackluster service. Most of these places are so cookie-cutter from the decor to the menu, it&#8217;s hard to differentiate between them. Close your eyes at any of them and take a sample of the food and you wouldn&#8217;t be able to tell the difference. But this is the exact thing Applebee&#8217;s hopes to fix. Applebee&#8217;s goal is to make a &#8220;special place for people to come together.&#8221;<\/p><!--more--><p>And to do that they just updated to a new logo with the tagline &#8220;Together is good.&#8221; As a side, the use of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.applebees.com\/auditions\/\">Wanda Sykes as the &#8220;spokesapple&#8221;<\/a> seems a little bit on the cheesy side, but might turn out to be a good move. It&#8217;s always risky to have a celebrity back your product due to personal biases. Let&#8217;s just hope people see the humor in the new campaign. <\/p>\n<p>The new logo itself is just blah. (Yes, I know, so poignant a critique). The old mark was awful, but I think Applebee&#8217;s missed something in translation. The type on the new mark is alright, although the A really bugs me. I imagine Armin is loving the Cooper Black tagline. I think it is playful and does the job pretty well. The apple and its outline is a big annoyance though. The hues are so close together, why not just have a solid apple? The overall color scheme is appropriate and a nice evolution from the old one, but I would have liked to see something besides green for the tagline text.<\/p>\n<p>I guess it&#8217;s just the combination of the <em>okay<\/em> logo and new advertising campaign &mdash; a speaking apple? really? &mdash; that makes me feel less than enthusiastic about this one. But at least that old typography on a street sign logo is gone. Make sure to check out the looping flash piece on their <a href=\"http:\/\/www.applebees.com\/\">website<\/a>!
