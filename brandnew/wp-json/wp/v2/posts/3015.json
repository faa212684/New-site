The brand aims to transform the complexity fast and easy solutions, simplifying products and processes, with the best combination between the team and technology to make things work.

From its clunky arrow in parentheses to its unimaginative choice of Helvetica to its unhelpfully wide tracking, there really are no redeeming qualities about it or anything to entice people to insure their vehicles with them. The new logo is a handsome, slightly quirky wordmark that looks great on its own; it&#8217;s not particularly distinctive but the cut-off &#8220;D&#8221; may be enough to make it recognizable. I&#8217;m not convinced by the hyphen though, as it never integrates with anything in application where it would encourage people to complete thoughts as they imply in the quote above. I would have gone for a period instead of a hyphen: &#8220;Direct. Period.&#8221; It would emphasize more of the simplicity and bluntness they are trying to achieve.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/direct_seguros_business_cards.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Direct by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/direct_seguros_materials_screengrab.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Direct by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Various materials.

It&#8217;s hard to dislike it since Futura is, like, awesome and thick-line illustrations are, like, awesome too. (In this case, illustrations could be a little better and less rough around the edges). The secondary choice of Tahoma is questionable. Very questionable. But the overall result is a pleasing set of materials that allows for numerous applications and variations on the tone of voice and graphic simplicity. Not groundbreaking but a definite improvement.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1995, Direct Seguros (Direct Insurance) is an auto insurance company in Spain, owned by AXA Group, with more than 600,000 clients.
