For more than 80 years we&#8217;ve championed anyone whose rights come under threat, from gypsy and traveller communities to Government whistle-blowers. Liberty was founded in 1934 in response to brutal police attempts to stop peaceful protests during the Hunger Marches and the &#8216;general and alarming tendency to encroach on the liberty of the citizen&#8217;. Since then we&#8217;ve become the UK&#8217;s largest civil liberties organisation, with more than 10,500 members and supporters. We campaign for everyone in the UK to be treated fairly, with dignity and respect. We&#8217;re independent. Our principles are guided by evidence, expertise and the human impact. We&#8217;re not swayed by political agenda, profit or popular opinion. From fighting against compulsory ID cards to campaigning for trans equality &#8211; Liberty stands on the side of freedom and justice. We&#8217;re not afraid to speak uncomfortable truths and we challenge intolerance, discrimination and the abuse of power wherever we find it.&#8221;<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/liberty_rights_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Liberty by North\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/liberty_rights_shorthand_campaign_banner.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Liberty by North\" \/>\n<figcaption>Shorthand logo + Campaign banner.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/liberty_rights_shorthand_guide.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Liberty by North\" \/>\n<figcaption>Shorthand logo + Liberty&#8217;s guide to the human rights act.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/liberty_rights_shorthand_campaign_material.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Liberty by North\" \/>\n<figcaption>Shorthand logo + Campaign materials.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/liberty_rights_shorthand_campaign_flat.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Liberty by North\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brand campaign.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/liberty_rights_shorthand_campaign_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Liberty by North\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/liberty_rights_shorthand_campaign_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Liberty by North\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/liberty_rights_shorthand_campaign_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Liberty by North\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brand campaign posters.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"(Est. 1934) &quot;Liberty is ordinary people standing up to power.
