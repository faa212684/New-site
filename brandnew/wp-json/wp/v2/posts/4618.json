This month, the system is being completely relaunched with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/urban-infrastructure-partner-as\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Urban Infrastructure Partner<\/a> managing it on behalf of Clear Channel, based on technology from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sharebike.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ShareBike<\/a>, and new bikes designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.frostprodukt.com\/News\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Frost Produkt<\/a>. The system will expand to 3,000 bicycles and 300 stations, with a third of them being placed between &#8220;Ring 2&#8221; and &#8220;Ring 3&#8221; of the city &#8212; &#8220;Ring 1&#8221; being the main city area. The new identity for Oslo Bysykkel has been designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/heydays.no\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Heydays<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>Our solution is centered around the simple abstraction of a bike\/face. A simple identity that acts both static on the bikes but also dynamically in the app or on the racks. A friendly character that guides you through the service, with a bit of a personality. It tells you if something is wrong, looks for new bikers when idling on the rack or whises you a good day after ending your city bike ride.<\/blockquote><h3> Heydays provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/164097175?title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo expressions, animated.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/oslo_city_bike_logo_expressions.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Oslo Bysykkel by Heydays\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo expressions.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>I&#8217;m posting this as a &#8220;New&#8221; logo instead of a &#8220;Before\/After&#8221; in part because this is meant to be a reboot and in part because there is no clear old logo for it, which is all for the better because what little there was of a hint of a logo wasn&#8217;t anything memorable. The new logo will turn that frown on your face upside down with an abstract bike that doubles as a face with a surprising amount of personality. As a representation of a bike, the four elements in the logo are as simple as you could push it before being completely useless and as the representation of a face, I love how the handle bar turns into a raised eyebrow and the eyes are big and excited. In either interpretation, the logo is fun, simple, and effective.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/oslo_city_bike_app.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Oslo Bysykkel by Heydays\" \/>\n<figcaption>App concept sketches.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/oslo_city_bike_installing_01_detail.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Oslo Bysykkel by Heydays\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/oslo_city_bike_installing_02_detail.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Oslo Bysykkel by Heydays\" \/>\n<figcaption>Installing racks and bikes.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/oslo_city_bike_bike_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Oslo Bysykkel by Heydays\" \/>\n<figcaption>Bike.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/oslo_city_bike_bike_01_detail.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Oslo Bysykkel by Heydays\" \/>\n<figcaption>Bike detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/oslo_city_bike_stand.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Oslo Bysykkel by Heydays\" \/>\n<figcaption>Bike stand.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/oslo_city_bike_kiosk.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Oslo Bysykkel by Heydays\" \/>\n<figcaption>Kiosk.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/163236521?title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"775\" height=\"436\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Kiosk, animated.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/oslo_city_bike_old.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Oslo Bysykkel by Heydays\" \/>\n<figcaption>Old\/existing bike racks.

The pictures of the new bikes show a pristine white space on the back wheel but that will eventually have advertising like the image directly above &#8212; a necessary evil that will take away the niceness. Overall, the logo, bikes, and kiosk system have a friendly and upbeat attitude that provide an appropriate spin on the happy-face-as-logo device in a way that makes sense and fits the service.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"First launched in 2003, Oslo Bysykkel (Oslo City Bikes) is a bike sharing system in Olso, Norway, originally implemented by Clear Channel Norway AS with around 1,000 bikes in 100 stations.
