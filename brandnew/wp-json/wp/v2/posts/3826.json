The company takes its name, adopted in 1924, from the pen name of French, Russian-born, nineteenth-century illustrator, Emmanuel Poir&eacute;. The nickname itself is based on &#8220;karandash&#8221;, the Russian word for pencil. Their product offering comes in three categories: Color, which includes pencils, pastels, watercolor, and more; Writing Instruments, focusing on fountain pens; and the Office Line, a small range of really nice pens. Previously identified with separate logos and marks, Caran d&#8217;Ache recently introduced, coinciding with its 100th anniversary, a new single identity for the company and its products designed by the Geneva office of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.basedesign.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Base<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>The signature of the cartoonist Emmanuel Poir&eacute;, to whom Caran d&#8217;Ache owes its name, was the starting point of our redesign.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.basedesign.com\/case-study\/caran-dache\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Base project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/caran_dache_logo_evolution.png\" alt=\"New Logo for Caran d&amp;apos;Ache by Base\" \/>\n<figcaption>New logo source and evolution.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/caran_dache_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo for Caran d&amp;apos;Ache by Base\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The new logo replaces three previous Caran d&#8217;Ache marks: the droopy lettering used for the colors line, the Optima-esque wordmark used as the corporate and Writing Instruments mark, and the CdA monogram, used for I&#8217;m not sure what. If you were to look only at the corporate wordmark as the before, the conversation leads one way: it&#8217;s a nice evolution that cleans up the letters by having better interaction between characters and adds a touch of contemporary aesthetic by going full sans. However, when you look at the classic, melting wordmark associated with the colored pencils then it&#8217;s another conversation: The wordmark foregoes a lot of built nostalgic equity in exchange for a more sterile approach. It&#8217;s not that the old droopy logo was great; it really isn&#8217;t if you look at it for more than one minute but it&#8217;s a classic.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/caran_dache_colors.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Caran d&amp;apos;Ache by Base\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo on famous color box.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/caran_dache_100collection.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Caran d&amp;apos;Ache by Base\" \/>\n<figcaption>The new logo on 100 anniversary collection.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>In application, it makes a convincing case, achieving a good balance of sophistication and playfulness at the same time, benefitting from the product it&#8217;s selling.
