It first came together with a campaign led by 16 people to stop a dam from being built on the Franklin River in Tasmania. Today, the organization counts with over 30,000 volunteers and members who help fight deforestation, secure better laws for conservation, and protect Australia&#8217;s nature preserves. Recently, Wilderness Society introduced a new identity designed by Windsor, Australia-based <a href=\"https:\/\/alter.com.au\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Alter<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>The logo is a wiggly line dubbed &#8216;The River&#8217;. It&#8217;s a simple and natural concept that&#8217;s about the forces which shape and support life. It&#8217;s a mark that meanders through its surroundings. An organic, friendly and playful tool.

The triangle configuration made it look urgent somehow and the all-caps wordmark looked serious. Where the old logo was abundantly literal, the new one is abstract and demanding interpretation&#8230; it&#8217;s clearly a &#8220;W&#8221; but the river reference might not be as immediate for everyone. (I saw it right away &#8212; not that that makes me special but I did have my doubts about whether there was something else to it.)<\/p>\n<p>Also, where the old logo was more descriptive &#8212; as in &#8220;we are going to protect these kind of animals, and these kind of plants, and these kind of little berries&#8221; &#8212; the new one is able to broadly encompass all the different actions of the organization and broaden the perception of its scope. Visually, I like it; it&#8217;s a simple mark, it&#8217;s organic, and it builds on the current minimalist trend but in a slightly quirky way. The wordmark is fine, if a little expected.<\/p>\n<blockquote>The river motif can expand, animate and be used to communicate ideas.Or it can be used in almost infinitely variable configurations across collateral.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/alter.com.au\/wilderness\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Alter project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video controls controlsList=\"nodownload\" poster=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/wilderness_society_river_crops_02.jpg\" loop><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/wilderness_society_river_crops_02.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>River crops.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The river crops is a good idea and it yields some interesting compositions.

The campaign is punctuated by a Jim Henson-<em>The Dark Crystal<\/em>-esque-meets-Aardman film made extra catchy with a singing, dancing, rapping Rosario Dawson. It&#8217;s definitely worth the 3 minutes. Overall, and prettiest-moth-ever aside, this is a smart redesign that opens up the interpretation of what this organization does beyond plants and platypi.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1976, the Wilderness Society is a nonprofit organization in Australia working to &quot;support the living world that makes all life possible&quot;.
