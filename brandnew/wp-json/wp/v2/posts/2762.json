It wasn&#8217;t the best either but it&#8217;s biggest drawback was that it felt much more like a financial services brand than a travel agency. The new logo is undeniably more consumer friendly. It&#8217;s a heart. It&#8217;s sunny. The concept is so syrupy sweet it almost makes your teeth hurt. But the execution in both the shape of the heart and the typography is still somewhat cold, failing to really establish a warmer connection with the customers. If you look at the brand architecture chart, where the Ving\/Tj&auml;reborg\/Spies logos are, you can see a softening of the typography that takes the brand away from the we-want-your-money spectrum. It would have been beneficial to establish a waterfall effect of typography that makes the corporate mark feel like a business suit and fancy shoes and the customer mark feel like sweater-around-the-neck and loafers. Overall, it&#8217;s an improvement for sure, but it could have been taken further. Perhaps if they had paid one of those &#8220;expensive consultants&#8221;&hellip;<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Founded by Thomas Cook in 1841 when he reportedly organized one of the first-ever publicly-acknowledged tours in history by arranging for the transport of passengers and taking a fee from the rail tickets, the eponymous Thomas Cook is now one&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,73,26],"tags":[46,783,367,952,697,530],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2762"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2762"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2762\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2762"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2762"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2762"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
