The organization was founded by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1938, as the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, to combat polio. The name &#8220;March of Dimes&#8221; was coined by Eddie Cantor. After funding Jonas Salk&#8217;s polio vaccine, the organization expanded its focus to the prevention of birth defects and infant mortality.
