As is the case with successful food trucks, Jacober opened a brick and mortar sandwich shop in Brooklyn with plans to expand to more locations and now also offers catering. To unify the growing grilled cheese empire, <a href=\"http:\/\/eatmorris.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Morris<\/a> has been established as the parent brand with a new identity designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pearlfisher.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pearlfisher<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>As a foundation for the future, Pearlfisher developed a unique brand identity that could evolve with each new offering. Custom letterforms, inspired by Russian constructivism, maintain their shape across the range, but the nature of the mark is free to adapt to match each new venture. A cohesive secondary language, &#8220;eatmor,&#8221; helps to tie the offerings together. [&hellip;] With a revised strategy, identity and design system, Pearlfisher&#8217;s work for Morris has helped grow the entrepreneurial food truck into a multifaceted brand with multiple layers and room for growth. Morris&#8217;s brand offerings now span The Morris Truck, Morris Test Kitchen, Morris Sandwich Shop, Morris Catering and several Morris installations and pop-ups around New York State.<\/blockquote><h3>Pearlfisher provided press release<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/morris_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Morris by Pearlfisher\" \/>\n<figcaption>The various logos.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/morris_logos_all.gif\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Morris by Pearlfisher\" \/>\n<figcaption>Animation between logos.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>A food truck and a single location usually don&#8217;t make it to the Reviewed column on Brand New as I tend to reserve it for the bigger clients but I found the approach to this logo\/brand architecture interesting. The idea to build a foundational wordmark that can take on different stylings &mdash; not just decoration or random textures but actual changes &mdash; is a clever way to build flexibility into the identity. The wordmark in this case is quite peculiar, starting off as a classic Gotham-esque sans serif but with attention-grabbing &#8220;R&#8221;s that I&#8217;m still undecided if I love or hate but I&#8217;m definitely not indifferent to them and they make you take notice. The sandwich shop and test kitchen are my preferred stylings and they are perfect for the artisanal aesthetic of the Brooklyn culinary world.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/morris_materials.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Morris by Pearlfisher\" \/>\n<figcaption>Various materials.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/morris_truck_irl.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Morris by Pearlfisher\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/morris_truck_irl_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Morris by Pearlfisher\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/morris_truck_irl_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Morris by Pearlfisher\" \/>\n<figcaption>The Morris Truck.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/morris_sandwich_shop.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Morris by Pearlfisher\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sandwich shop.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/morris_test_kitchen.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Morris by Pearlfisher\" \/>\n<figcaption>Test kitchen.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/morris_apron.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Morris by Pearlfisher\" \/>\n<figcaption>Apron dude.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">The logos are complemented with a bold &#8220;EAT MOR&#8221; pattern that looks great cropped into the panels of the truck or as a bandana-scarf-thing.
