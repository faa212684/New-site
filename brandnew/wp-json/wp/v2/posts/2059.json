Last week, Island Air introduced a new logo and livery designed by New York, NY-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.clarkhuot.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Clark\/Huot<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>ClarkHuot was asked to help re-imagine and redesign Island Air&#8217;s overall brand identity with a focus on the development of an eye-catching new aircraft livery. The new identity consists of a bold and graphic representation of Hawaii&#8217;s iconic and storied lei. The color program includes a selected range that denotes the indigenous and natural hues of the Island, including the volcanic ring of fire as well as the eye-catching effect of a ceremonial Hawaiian torch dance. The name is rendered in a new, more contemporary typeface, Dessau Pro Drei. In addition Island Air&#8217;s new brand expression will include application onto various touch points including online, in-flight and airport materials. This new design program will work to better re-position the airline as the preferred choice for both local and tourist inter-island travel.<br \/>&mdash; Clark\/Huot Provided Materials<\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/island_air_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"Island Air Logo and Livery\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/island_air_livery.jpg\" alt=\"Island Air Logo and Livery\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The old logo wasn&#8217;t anything remarkable &mdash; although the slightly horizontally-scaled use of Trajan should be remarked as awful &mdash; nor was it particularly Hawaiian. And by that I don&#8217;t mean that it should scream HAWAII! but it should at least try. The new logo tries and, without a doubt, it definitely succeeds in looking like a Hawaii airline but, unfortunately it didn&#8217;t try hard enough to go one step beyond an expected solution. The icon is a lei. That&#8217;s it. There is no visual play, there is no twist, there is no surprise. I&#8217;m not implying that the logo should be a lei in the shape of the islands doing a Hula dance but the execution is flat and rudimentary; I really wish there was something more to it. The name of the airline, set in a Bauhaus-esque sans serif and in stark black, makes for a strange contrast agains the fire-toned icon and feel like two different identities coming together. The one aspect I sort of like in this redesign is the tail of the airplanes, with the blues and turquoises offsetting the lei icon. Overall, yes, it&#8217;s now obviously a Hawaiian airline, but not a very inspiring one.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to Edgar Omar Garcia for the tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_120723_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_120723_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"285\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_120723_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_120723_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"285\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_120723_config_03.xml&#038;xyz=poll_120723_votes_03.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"285\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv3\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv3\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[60,9,26],"tags":[563,757,226],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2059"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2059"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2059\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2059"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2059"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2059"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
