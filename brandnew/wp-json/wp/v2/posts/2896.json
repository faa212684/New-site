Designed by Oslo-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.work.no\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Work<\/a>, the logo and packaging are almost annoyingly simple: it&#8217;s a single, bold typeface and it&#8217;s blue and transparent. That&#8217;s it. And it looks bad-ass. That typeface was put on this earth to sell ice. For some additional photos that show that the project doesn&#8217;t look great in just sexy lighting and sweaty bags check Mr. Iceman&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/MrIceman\/350621381718989?id=350621381718989&#038;sk=photos_stream\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Facebook photos<\/a>. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.work.no\/project\/mriceman-branding\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Elena Damy by Mattson Creative<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_elenadamy.jpg\" alt=\"Elena Damy by Mattson Creative\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">This is isn&#8217;t a big, comprehensive identity, just a simple, geometric logo for Baja California- and Los Angeles-based <a href=http:\/\/elenadamy.com\/about-us\/\" target=\"_blank\">Elena Damy<\/a>, a high-end wedding and event designer with a penchant for beautiful floral arrangements and sculptures. Whether I&#8217;m being seduced by the logo burned into a thick piece of wood is up for debate but I find the logo, designed by Irvine, CA-based <a href=\"http:\/\/mattsoncreative.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mattson Creative<\/a> to be charming, sophisticated, and festive in all the right places. <a href=\"http:\/\/mattsoncreative.com\/blog\/2013\/12\/08\/elena-damy-branding\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Today by Adhemas Batista<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_today.jpg\" alt=\"Today by Adhemas Batista\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">Now here is something completely different that I wouldn&#8217;t have expected to like. <a href=\"http:\/\/today.ag\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Today<\/a> is a digital agency in Sao Paulo, Brazil and their identity is an explosion of color, texture, and shapes that makes Carnival look like, well, still more colorful and crazy but you know where I was going with that. Designed by Los Angeles, CA-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.behance.net\/Adhemas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Adhemas Batista<\/a>, the identity goes in all kinds of crazy and unexpected directions sticking to a yellow, red, and blue palette that is both grating and energizing. I don&#8217;t care much for the logo itself but the analog clock device works great with the name and the imagery. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/Agency-Today\/10277305\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"From the chilling blue hues of ice packaging to the festively warm colors of a digital agency we have a nicely eclectic range of Friday Likes from Oslo; Irvine, CA; and Brazil via Los Angeles, CA&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[292,772,617,956],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2896"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2896"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2896\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2896"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2896"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2896"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
