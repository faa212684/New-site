And a bad-ass logo. Designed by Portland, OR-based <a href=\"http:\/\/hovercraftstudio.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hovercraft Studio<\/a>, the logo is an abstract &#8220;B&#8221; rotated 45 degrees right to leave a mountain shape pointing up and topped with a simple depiction of snow. It&#8217;s simple, it&#8217;s smart, it has snowboarder appeal and it&#8217;s well done. The visuals and advertising campaign have a fun, Roy Lichtenstein-dot approach in a minty color palette that add to the festive feel of Boreal. <a href=\"http:\/\/hovercraftstudio.com\/boreal-mountain\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Design by Hand by OCD<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_designbyhand.gif\" alt=\"Design by Hand by OCD\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">Presented by the Cooper-Hewitt from fall 2013 through spring 2017, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cooperhewitt.org\/events\/design-hand\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Design by Hand<\/a> is a series that &#8220;focuses on the craftsmanship, innovations, and merits of contemporary global designers.&#8221; Designed by New York, NY-based <a href=\"http:\/\/originalchampionsofdesign.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">OCD | The Original Champions of Design<\/a>, the logo and identity resisted the urge to be, you know, designed by hand and be all scribbly. Instead, a perfectly crafted, abstract hand figure that conveys both that everything is A-ok and that whatever it is holding has been hand-picked. Drawing hands as logos is amazingly difficult &mdash; just ask <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=united+way+logo&#038;espv=210&#038;es_sm=91&#038;source=lnms&#038;tbm=isch&#038;sa=X&#038;ei=bP_9UrSrF6Wi2QWLvYGwDQ&#038;sqi=2&#038;ved=0CAcQ_AUoAQ&#038;biw=1312&#038;bih=866\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">United Way<\/a>, then and now &mdash; and this works so great in its geometric approach. There is also a great mid-twentieth-century aesthetic going on with the color palette, chunky typography and repetition of form. <a href=\"http:\/\/originalchampionsofdesign.com\/work\/design-by-hand\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Xoclad by Anagrama<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_xoclad.jpg\" alt=\"Xoclad by Anagrama\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">With pre-Hispanic words the &#8220;X&#8221; is pronounced as &#8220;SH&#8221; so the name for this new pastry and confectionery shop in the Mayan Riviera in Mexico, Xoclad, is pronounced like chocolate. A clever way to bring in an &#8220;X&#8221; into the mix, because &#8220;X&#8221;s are awesome. Designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.anagrama.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Anagrama<\/a>, the simple wordmark is accompanied by a crazy-looking pattern that is representative of many of the decorations you would find in ruins across the region. The pattern looks best when used in small details like the piece of tape or the cloth for the spreads. I also liked the stacked boxes of typography in the business cards, giving it a contemporary look reminiscent of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.karlssonwilker.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">KarlssonWilker<\/a> house style. The pink and mint color palette adds to the overall quirky vibe. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.anagrama.com\/portafolio\/158-xoclad\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"A lot of geometric and 45-degree angles this Friday with work from Portland, New York, and Monterrey&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[729,327,779],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3012"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3012"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3012\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3012"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3012"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3012"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
