Based in Germany, Lufthansa flies to 211 destinations in 74 countries with a fleet of close to 350 planes and is the largest European operator of the Airbus A380. This week, Lufthansa introduced a new logo, identity, and livery designed in-house in collaboration with Munich-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.martinetkarczinski.de\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Martin et Karczinski<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the crane, every detail of the design was reworked &#8211; to meet requirements of the digital age. The new Lufthansa appearance gives the individual elements a new, modern quality to sharpen their impact. The designers found great importance in taking up the unique design tradition of the Lufthansa brand and leading it into the future.<br \/><br \/>The crane, designed exactly 100 years ago by graphic artist Otto Firle, a distinctive icon in the sky, remains the airline&#8217;s iconic symbol. In the future, it will be slimmer and fit for the digital world. A thinner ring makes the crane look more elegant, bringing it into the foreground and granting it more space. All in all, the trademark will gain lightness and elegance. The familiar blue-yellow color combination of Lufthansa will also be retained &#8211; but the use of these primary colors will be redefined. The blue specially developed for Lufthansa is somewhat darker, more elegant and is becoming the leading brand color. It stands for reliability, clarity and value.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.lufthansagroup.com\/en\/themes\/explore-the-new.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lufthansa press release<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lufthansa_crane_evolution.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Livery for Lufthansa done In-house with Martin et Karczinski\" \/>\n<figcaption>Crane evolution over the years.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video controls><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lufthansa_on_crane_evolution_low_res.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>On the crane evolution.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lufthansa_crane_before_after.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Livery for Lufthansa done In-house with Martin et Karczinski\" \/>\n<figcaption>Crane, before and after.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lufthansa_crane_details.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Livery for Lufthansa done In-house with Martin et Karczinski\" \/>\n<figcaption>Crane details. (Sorry, image only available in German.)<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The crane icon has been in use for 100 years, designed in 1918 as part of the livery of the first German airline, Deutsche Luft-Reederei, later adopted by Deutsche Luft Hansa, and later-later by Lufthansa. Most of us associate it with Otl Aicher, who designed a comprehensive identity program around it in the early 1960s that gave it the more modern look it has had for most of our lifetimes (and established the blue and yellow combination as one of the key brand elements). In essence the crane icon remains the same as it has been since 1962 but has been redrawn to perform better under digital duress. The biggest change is the thinning of the ring which, as subtle a change as it is, it makes a fantastic difference in making it feel more elegant. The feathers in the wings of the crane have been opened up slightly making the icon easier to read at small size. The changes are minimal but each one provides a performance improvement.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lufthansa_wordmark_before_after.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Livery for Lufthansa done In-house with Martin et Karczinski\" \/>\n<figcaption>Wordmark, before (top) and after (bottom).<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video controls><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lufthansa_on_wordmark_evolution_low_res.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>On wordmark evolution.

While it&#8217;s not gone, it has definitely been demoted to being a complementary, accent color to the primary dark blue. I agree that yellow is one of the most iconic things about Lufthansa but after seeing all the images here I also think it will survive just fine without it at the center of the identity. Blue is the most ubiquitous color in the airline industry and it&#8217;s not distinctive at all so I think the responsibility rests on the crane to be the one key thing that makes Lufthansa Lufthansa.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lufthansa_livery_old.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Livery for Lufthansa done In-house with Martin et Karczinski\" \/>\n<figcaption>OLD livery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lufthansa_livery_new_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Livery for Lufthansa done In-house with Martin et Karczinski\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lufthansa_livery_new_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Livery for Lufthansa done In-house with Martin et Karczinski\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lufthansa_livery_new_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Livery for Lufthansa done In-house with Martin et Karczinski\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lufthansa_livery_new_04.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Livery for Lufthansa done In-house with Martin et Karczinski\" \/>\n<figcaption>New livery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The change to the livery is indeed a shock to the system.
