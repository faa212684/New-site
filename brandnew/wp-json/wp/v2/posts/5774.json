Located in the capital city of Buenos Aires it was formed directly after the country&#8217;s revolution against Spain and is now named after its first director, Mariano Moreno. The library is housed in a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bn.gov.ar\/biblioteca\/acerca\/galeria\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brutalist<\/a> building designed by Clorindo Testa, Alicia D. Cazzanica, and Francisco Bullrich in 1961 but construction didn&#8217;t start until 1971 and wasn&#8217;t occupied until 1992. Today, the library houses over 900,000 books; 55,000 periodicals; 30,000 photographs and negatives; 12,000 maps; and 300,000 music sheets, among other items. Earlier this year, Biblioteca Nacional conducted a contest that received over 750 entries and the winning logo was designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/b-estudio.com.ar\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">B. Estudio<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/biblioteca_nacional_mariano_logo_equation.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Biblioteca Nacional Mariano Moreno by B.

The new logo flips the importance from &#8220;Biblioteca Nacional&#8221; to &#8220;Mariano Moreno&#8221; by introducing a double-&#8220;M&#8221; monogram that cleverly doubles as a series of leaning books, ensuring that this logo couldn&#8217;t be used for a quaint hotel or restaurant. It&#8217;s a great monogram but also passes as an abstract icon as the &#8220;M&#8221;s are not an immediate read (which is a good thing). As much as I love the monogram there is one detail that drives me nuts&#8230; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/biblioteca_nacional_mariano_monogram_comment.png\" target=\"_blank\">these two spaces within each &#8220;M&#8221;<\/a> that are not exactly alike and they should be. Nonetheless, the double-&#8220;M&#8221;s match the Brutalist architecture and they have an envious simplicity to them. The wordmark, in Neue Haas Unica, is nice enough and complements the monogram well.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video controls><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/biblioteca_nacional_mariano_guidelines.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Guidelines.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/biblioteca_nacional_mariano_stationery.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Biblioteca Nacional Mariano Moreno by B.

The tote bag below would look SO good with a thinner stroke or no stroke at all. The color palette is a little random somehow but it looks good in the icon.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/biblioteca_nacional_mariano_tote_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Biblioteca Nacional Mariano Moreno by B.

It almost makes you forget and forgive this was the result of a contest.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1810, Biblioteca Nacional Mariano Moreno is the national and largest library in Argentina.
