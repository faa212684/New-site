EPUB is quickly becoming the industry standard for eBooks &mdash; despite Amazon&#8217;s Kindle not supporting it natively &mdash; and it&#8217;s the job of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.idpf.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The International Digital Publishing Forum<\/a> (IDPF) to maintain its standards and promote its adoption. Earlier this year <a href=\"http:\/\/www.idpf.org\/EPUBlogo\/epublogocontest.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">IDPF conducted a contest to design the official logo of EPUB<\/a>.<!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/epub_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"ePub Logo, New\" \/><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.idpf.org\/EPUBlogo\/epublogocontest_winner.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The winning entry<\/a> was designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.burkhardthauke.de\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ralph Burkhardt<\/a> from Stuttgart, Germany beating a little over 200 other entries from 18 different countries. Beyond the fact the that this was done as a contest, there are many things wrong with this logo. The first is that it places heavy emphasis on the &#8220;E&#8221; part of EPUB by having an enormous Enron-tilted &#8220;e&#8221; as the icon, so this could be used for anything in the world that attaches an &#8220;e&#8221; at the beginning of a name to indicate Electronic-something. This could be overlooked if the &#8220;e&#8221; icon somehow integrated a visual metaphor or indicator that this is about books and publications, but it doesn&#8217;t. The counterspace of the &#8220;e&#8221; is also so strong that my brain wants to see something there, perhaps a &#8220;p&#8221; but there is nothing there. Then there is the typography which is simple to the point of boredom. Finally there is the color combination: green and brown. Neither of which makes me think of electronics or publication, much less the combination of electronics <em>and<\/em> publication.<\/p>\n<p>Whether a better solution could have been achieved by hiring a designer or design firm to do this without a contest is hard to prove, but this just adds fuel to the fire that contests rarely lead to good results.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to Jason Pokines for the tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_100621_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_100621_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_100621_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_100621_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[12,26,88],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1125"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1125"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1125\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1125"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1125"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1125"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
