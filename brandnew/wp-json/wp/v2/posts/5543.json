Created specifically for medium skin tones, Stellar offers a range of 22 foundations and six concealers, as well as blushes, lipsticks, powders, and a mascara. The logo and packaging were designed by Toronto, ON-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.brucemaudesign.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bruce Mau Design<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>Taking visual inspiration from the cosmos, the brand identity and name allude to starry constellations. The word mark includes a dot that echoes both the North Star and a beauty mark. The colors used reflect the inclusive nature of the brand. Black and white represent night and day while a secondary opalescent palette vibrates across the full spectrum of light. Guidelines ensure product photography and model photo shoots reverberate the effortless, confident, and bold brand ethos of Stellar.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.brucemaudesign.com\/work\/stellar\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BMD project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/\/stellar_logo.png\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Packaging for Stellar by Bruce Mau Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>With a slightly presumptuous name like &#8220;Stellar&#8221;, it would have been easy for this to have taken a turn for the worse by being too lofty or obnoxious but the minimalist execution is perfectly calibrated with a sturdy sans serif, just the right amount of airy letter-spacing, and a dot that&#8217;s neither too big nor too small to serve as a graphic trigger for something up in the sky. I also love the second read as a beauty mark, which I wouldn&#8217;t have thought of without reading the description and it might not even be arrow-in-FedEx-subtle but it makes for a nice secret.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/\/stellar-book-1.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Packaging for Stellar by Bruce Mau Design\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/\/stellar-book-2.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Packaging for Stellar by Bruce Mau Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brand guidelines.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/\/stellar-website-1.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Packaging for Stellar by Bruce Mau Design\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/\/stellar-website-2.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Packaging for Stellar by Bruce Mau Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Website.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Aside from packaging, of which there is plenty to see, there is not a lot on the identity but between the website and guidelines it&#8217;s easy to gather that it&#8217;s all about simplicity and nice product photography.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/\/stellar-packaging-1.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Packaging for Stellar by Bruce Mau Design\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/\/stellar-packaging-2.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Packaging for Stellar by Bruce Mau Design\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/\/stellar-packaging-3.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Packaging for Stellar by Bruce Mau Design\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/\/stellar-packaging-4.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Packaging for Stellar by Bruce Mau Design\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/\/stellar-packaging-5.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Packaging for Stellar by Bruce Mau Design\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/\/stellar-packaging-6.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Packaging for Stellar by Bruce Mau Design\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/\/stellar-packaging-7.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Packaging for Stellar by Bruce Mau Design\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/\/stellar-packaging-8.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Packaging for Stellar by Bruce Mau Design\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/\/stellar-packaging-9.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Packaging for Stellar by Bruce Mau Design\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/\/stellar-packaging-10.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Packaging for Stellar by Bruce Mau Design\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/\/stellar-packaging-11.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Packaging for Stellar by Bruce Mau Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">In a way, there is nothing revolutionary about the packaging&#8230; it looks exactly like makeup packaging looks, especially when you think of Sephora-style cosmetics where simplicity and minimalist packaging that allows the product to be the center of attention are the norm but, still, there is a striking balance of starkness and exuberance (through the rainbow foil dots) in Stellar that makes it stand out. I&#8217;m not a field expert on makeup packaging and product but this has a beautiful, restrained edge to it that is hard to achieve.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Launched earlier this year, Stellar is a new line of makeup available exclusively at Sephora created by Punjab, India-born Monika Deol, a fixture of Canadian television, who spent many years as a VJ for MuchMusic and found it a struggle&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[51,12,26],"tags":[45,554,1374,676,579,1440,53,654],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5543"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=5543"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5543\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=5543"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=5543"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=5543"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
