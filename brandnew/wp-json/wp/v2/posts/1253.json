Novelli and Jack Porter in Washington DC, <a href=\"http:\/\/porternovelli.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Porter Novelli<\/a> was started to &#8220;apply marketing to social and health issues.&#8221; Today, with 90 offices in 60 countries, Porter Novelli is one of the leading public relations firms in the world balancing its original scope of clients as well as working with consumer brands. They are responsible for projects like the Truth anti-smoking campaign and the original and new food pyramids. Earlier this month, Porter Novelli introduced a new identity designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/interbrand.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Interbrand<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>The agency&#8217;s logo features a new graphic element, &#8220;The Transformer&#8221; icon, which signals the agency&#8217;s transformational work for clients and its leadership role in the industry. It is displayed in saturated orange against bold white and black backgrounds.<br \/><br \/>[&hellip;]<br \/><br \/>The identity system&#8217;s visual imagery focuses on the transformational effect of &#8220;deeper human insights,&#8221; which is at the core of the agency&#8217;s value proposition. It also speaks to the integrated digital strategy and digital delivery systems that have transformed the way that the agency works, as well as its creative product.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/porternovelli.com\/news-room\/porter-novelli-unveils-new-global-brand-identity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press Release<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/porter_novelli_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"Porter Novelli\"><\/p>\n<p>I shouldn&#8217;t criticize design firms for giving cute names to their logos because I do it all the time, but I tend to do it tongue-in-cheek and don&#8217;t give them names like &#8220;The Transformer.&#8221; Especially when it&#8217;s just a chevron. Nonetheless, as far as chevrons go, this is a nice one. It&#8217;s not groundbreaking or original, but it&#8217;s nice. Or, well, it doesn&#8217;t suck. The typography, in all uppercase Gotham, doesn&#8217;t suck either and is neither groundbreaking or original. You can see a trend here. It&#8217;s all properly done and looks nice and fancy but there is nothing else to it. Not that there needs to be, but then they could turn the PR-speak down a notch or ten. The use of DIN on the website feels odd against the choice of Gotham in the logo but I&#8217;ve never been a fan of mixing sans serifs. In the end, the new identity appears more sophisticated than the previous one and sometimes that&#8217;s enough to issue a press release.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.encmarketing.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Glenn Forester<\/a> for first tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_101129_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_101129_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_101129_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_101129_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,36,26],"tags":[391,314,255,392,393],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1253"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1253"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1253\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1253"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1253"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1253"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
