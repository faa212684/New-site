The kicker: Uber is not allowed. So far, Karhoo has signed up a network totaling 400,000 local taxis, minicabs, and executive cars in London, where it is first launching, and in Los Angeles, New York, and Singapore, where it aims to expand by 2017. The identity for Karhoo has been designed by London-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.someoneinlondon.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SomeOne<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>The brief to was to build a brand that supports Karhoo&#8217;s mission to use positive disruption to help established operators of licensed black cabs, minicabs and executive cars level the playing field and be part of the e-hailing revolution, while giving consumers more choice with every cab booking.<br \/><br \/>A beautifully simple world of graphic &#8216;wheels&#8217; in all of their sizes, behaviours and colours that scream &#8216;choice&#8217;. There&#8217;s something in there for everyone.<br \/><br \/>This brand will predominantly live on screens, so we capitalised on the opportunity to make it feel bright and alive, and created a &#8216;pingy&#8217; and positive standout palette that could grow over time as Karhoo&#8217;s network of cab companies grow.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.someoneinlondon.com\/project\/here_comes_choice\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SomeOne project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/karhoo_logo.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Karhoo by SomeOne\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The previous logo was a good start with a nice customized wordmark that conveyed a sense of streets. It even held up if you zoom out, maintaining a thin inline effect. The new logo takes the same letterforms, fills them up, and replaces the &#8220;o&#8221;s with two perfect circles that help cement gradients as the comeback trend of the year. As a logo I find the transparency and interlocking effect of the old one more interesting but the new one is somehow more confident as if it doesn&#8217;t need visual hooks to carry on with business.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/karhoo_gradients.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Karhoo by SomeOne\" \/>\n<figcaption>Gradients. 255 FTW!<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The identity relies on super bright RGB colors to establish a family of gradients applied to a world of &#8220;O&#8221;s. Maybe I&#8217;m a born-again sucker for this trend but I&#8217;m digging the gradients, both on their own and in application.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/karhoo_tagline.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Karhoo by SomeOne\" \/>\n<figcaption>Tagline.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/karhoo_ad_transit.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Karhoo by SomeOne\" \/>\n<figcaption>Ad.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/karhoo_business_card.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Karhoo by SomeOne\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business card. Not sure what happened here&#8230; maybe it was the last deliverable or comp of the night? Oddly very badly designed. Circle map is nice but the placement of it on the card (horizontal edges touching the end of the card) is so not right. And you can put an UberXL on the right part of the front of the business card. (Extended caption critique over.)<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/karhoo_app.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Karhoo by SomeOne\" \/>\n<figcaption>App.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/gZ_gDToxn6Y\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Introductory spot.

The very best thing about the project is the spot directly above. It&#8217;s like <em>Tron<\/em> in daylight and if it had had sex with Life Savers (or Polo fruits). Watch it in 1080p. It&#8217;s visually great. Overall, this works well within the boundaries of app-based start-ups disrupting this or that but has an extra boost in execution from the high-contrast gradients and doubling-down on the &#8220;OO&#8221; in the name to populate the world with bright &#8220;O&#8221;s throughout.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 2014 but launched this month in London, Karhoo is a cab comparison app that works with established operators of licensed black cabs, minicabs, and executive cars to provide users with options of what&apos;s the best car to order,&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,26,90],"tags":[991,617,46,302],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4676"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4676"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4676\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4676"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4676"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4676"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
