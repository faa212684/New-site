In addition, Pick n Pay changed their corporate tagline from &#8220;We&#8217;re on your side&#8221; to &#8220;Inspired by you&#8221; &mdash; maintaining their focus on the customer in a slightly more positive way than the old You vs. Them language. Pick n Pay brought on Young &amp; Rubicam SA to develop their new advertising campaign which draws from the revised tagline to create a new tonality focussed on &#8220;Inspired by&mdash;&#8221;. And, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.picknpay.co.za\/left_click_through\/index.php?id=330\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">In their own words<\/a>: <em>The new Pick n Pay logo is an evolutionary change, which while quite different from the original, retains key features that have made Pick &#8216;n Pay distinctive in the retail environment.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pickNpay_ad.jpg\" alt=\"Pick N Pay Ad\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Sample ad.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pickNpay_samples.jpg\" alt=\"Pick N Pay Ad\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>New product samples.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>This is a much needed re-branding. The previous logo seemed dated through its use of typography and rendering of the P-in-a-box letterforms, not to mention the black and red color scheme which seemed out of place and a tad aggressive. The move to Cachet does help modernize the logo and overall brand communications, however I would guess that Cachet is tech\/quirky looking enough to start appearing dated within a decade. Considering that the logo will be shortened in some contexts into &#8220;P n P&#8221; (utilizing the p-in-a-box motif for the &#8220;P&#8221; letters) the simplified &#8220;P,&#8221; having lost the outlined drop shadow, helps legibility. However, when the entire &#8220;Pick n Pay&#8221; logo is present there are certainly legibility issues that have arisen as a result of the negative &#8220;P&#8221; letterforms combined with the kerning of the positive letters, the two-color scheme and the loss of the apostrophe &mdash; creating a <em>P &hellip; ick&hellip; n P&hellip; ay<\/em> kind of situation where the &#8220;P&#8221; letterforms break the continuity as does the use of only two colors to identify essentially three words. Overall this is a step in the right direction, though with the resources being spent the final result still leaves room for improvement.<\/p>\n<p>You can read a lot more about the new logo and Pick n Pay <a href=\"http:\/\/www.picknpay.co.za\/left_click_through\/index.php?id=330\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a>, have a read through the online feedback regarding the new logo at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bizcommunity.com\/Poll\/196\/11\/4.html\" target=>Bizcommunity<\/a>, and you can see a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.zoopy.com\/video_3307_Street_Cam:_Pick_'n_Pay's_new_branding.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">video of someone interviewing people about the logo change<\/a>:<\/p>\n<p><object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" codebase=\"http:\/\/fpdownload.macromedia.com\/pub\/shockwave\/cabs\/flash\/swflash.cab#version=8,0,0,0\" width=\"322\" height=\"264\" id=\"Zoom\" bgcolor=\"#000000\"> <param name=\"allowScriptAccess\" value=\"sameDomain\" \/> <param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" \/> <param name=\"movie\" value=\"http:\/\/www.zoopy.com\/Small_offsite.swf\" \/> <param name=\"FlashVars\" value=\"stream=http:\/\/www.zoopy.com\/video\/1195654399.flv\"\/><param name=\"quality\" value=\"high\" \/> <param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#000000\" \/> <param name=\"loop\" value=\"false\" \/> <embed src=\"http:\/\/www.zoopy.com\/Small_offsite.swf\" FlashVars=\"stream=http:\/\/www.zoopy.com\/video\/1195654399.flv\" quality=\"high\" bgcolor=\"#000000\" width=\"322\" height=\"264\" name=\"Zoom\" loop=\"false\" allowScriptAccess=\"sameDomain\" allowFullScreen=\"true\" type=\"application\/x-shockwave-flash\" pluginspage=\"http:\/\/www.macromedia.com\/go\/getflashplayer\" \/><\/object><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Thanks to Jonno Cohen for the tip.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":4,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,86,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/562"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/4"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=562"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/562\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=562"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=562"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=562"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
