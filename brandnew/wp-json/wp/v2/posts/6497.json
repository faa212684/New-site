CPX releases a weekly podcast; maintains an archive of articles, videos, and audio; curates an active stream of religion-related news; and has recently produced a documentary, <em><a href=\"https:\/\/fortheloveofgodproject.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">For the Love of God<\/a><\/em> (with the subtitle of &#8220;How the church is BETTER + WORSE than you ever imagined&#8221;).

Or maybe I&#8217;m reading way too much into it and all it really is is an exploded <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Interrobang\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">interrobang<\/a>. I can also say that the icon was way, WAY, too big in relation to the wordmark, which wasn&#8217;t great either and had no reason for being all lowercase.<\/p>\n<p>In contrast to the old logo that made me question what the logo was all about, the new one is clear, clever, and engaging: I immediately read it as a cross, then I see the twist of turning it into a plus and minus sign, and it makes me curious about what the organization is and does as, from the outset, its logo is telling me that there are positives and negatives related to Christianity. The execution is very simple and straightforward, with its bluntness making the organization come across as being neutral, accessible, and amicable to all sides of the conversation. As opposed to the old logo, I also like how they treat the name all the same with all the words at the same size, instead of highlighting only &#8220;Christianity&#8221;, making it more about the center&#8217;s efforts than the religion its efforts are for.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/centre_for_public_christianity_business_cards.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Centre for Public Christianity by For the People\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/centre_for_public_christianity_leaflet.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Centre for Public Christianity by For the People\" \/>\n<figcaption>Leaflet.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/centre_for_public_christianity_new_testament.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Centre for Public Christianity by For the People\" \/>\n<figcaption>New Testament cover.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/centre_for_public_christianity_postcards.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Centre for Public Christianity by For the People\" \/>\n<figcaption>Postcards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/centre_for_public_christianity_banner.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Centre for Public Christianity by For the People\" \/>\n<figcaption>Banner.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Most of the applications shown are renders but do a great job in exploring the principle of the identity and the mission of the organization, which is to openly discuss the positives and negatives of the religion and doing it in an engaging and contemporary way.
