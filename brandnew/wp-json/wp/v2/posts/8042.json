Privately owned, their selection includes a range of designer brands as well as Strandbag&#8217;s own long-established and exclusive private label ranges. Recently, Strandbag introduced a new identity designed by Sydney, Australia-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.frostcollective.com.au\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Frost* Design<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>Our strategy focused on transitioning perceptions from &#8216;discounter&#8217; to &#8216;value retailer&#8217; by injecting a sense of lifestyle and travel into the brand experience; from &#8216;luggage&#8217; to &#8216;travel&#8217;, &#8216;handbags&#8217; to &#8216;fashion&#8217;.<br \/><br \/>&#8220;Taking People Places&#8221; is the brand idea that brings this to life. It&#8217;s not about discounts and bargains, it&#8217;s about life&#8217;s journeys. No matter who you are or where you&#8217;re going, Strandbags has the right bag for you.<br \/><br \/>The wordmark represents the connection between bag and person, always by your side, enhancing every journey and adventure. The handle is the symbol of this connection, creating the start of a journey, from A-B and beyond.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.frostcollective.com.au\/projects\/going-places-strandbags\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Frost* project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/strandbags_logo_before_after_followup.png\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Logo and Identity for Strandbags by Frost* Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo, before and after.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>I <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/new_logo_for_strandbags.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">first posted this<\/a> in the Spotted section last month and while I usually don&#8217;t add any thoughts to those posts I did have positive ones of them and imagined that this could be interesting in application, so here we are. The old logo, in out-of-the-box Gill Sans, was bland and showcased everything I dislike about Gill Sans &#8212; that &#8220;db&#8221; pair, the toppling &#8220;a&#8221;, the gangly &#8220;r&#8221;, et al &#8212; in a single wordmark. The new logo may seem like a Design 101 concept with type on a half circle meant to evoke the handle of a bag but as basic as it may seem it&#8217;s highly efficient, relevant, and a satisfying, easy-to-solve visual puzzle for the rest of the population that isn&#8217;t hard-to-please graphic designers. The deadpan sans serif, which is very much in line with the Burberrys and Balenciagas of the world, adds a degree of fashion-ness that elevates Strandbags from being seen as a utilitarian retail brand to more of a lifestyle brand. The half-circle logo starting and ending with an &#8220;S&#8221; on the baseline makes me happy and when they are slightly cropped provide a great opportunity for some circular treatments.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\" style=\"padding-bottom:67.25%\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/strandbags_logo_animated_01.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<hr \/>\n<div class=\"video-container\" style=\"padding-bottom:67.25%\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/strandbags_logo_animated_02_various.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo animations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/strandbags_logo_tagline_animated.gif\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Logo and Identity for Strandbags by Frost* Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo and tagline animation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/strandbags_logo_tagline_photo.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Logo and Identity for Strandbags by Frost* Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo with tagline with photo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The script tagline is pretty nice and I like how it can be paired with the logo small above it or with the logo big behind it.

While the bag is in frame, the hero is the journey.<br \/><br \/>By using the brand&#8217;s iconic red in a more premium way, establishing a clearer messaging hierarchy throughout and forming a strong narrative, a new Strandbags journey begins.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.frostcollective.com.au\/projects\/going-places-strandbags\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Frost* project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/plugins\/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FStrandbagsStores%2Fvideos%2F424107601645655%2F&#038;show_text=0&#038;width=560\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowTransparency=\"true\" allowFullScreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>New look introduction video.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/strandbags_brochure_01.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Logo and Identity for Strandbags by Frost* Design\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/strandbags_brochure_02.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Logo and Identity for Strandbags by Frost* Design\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/strandbags_brochure_03.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Logo and Identity for Strandbags by Frost* Design\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/strandbags_brochure_04.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Logo and Identity for Strandbags by Frost* Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brochure.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/strandbags_instagram_posts.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Logo and Identity for Strandbags by Frost* Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Instagram posts.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/strandbags_business_cards.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Logo and Identity for Strandbags by Frost* Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/strandbags_posters.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Logo and Identity for Strandbags by Frost* Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Posters.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/strandbags_wild_postings.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Logo and Identity for Strandbags by Frost* Design\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/strandbags_wild_postings_02.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Logo and Identity for Strandbags by Frost* Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Wild postings.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Some of the applications double down on the bag handle concept by placing the logo on top of a rectangular field of color or cropped photograph and, again, it may seem obvious but I think it&#8217;s handled in a playful and sophisticated way that doesn&#8217;t feel like a student exercise, which could easily be the case. The only element I would question is the secondary sans serif &#8212; the one for &#8220;Summer Sale&#8221; or the long paragraph of text directly above &#8212; where it starts to introduce a different aesthetic from what has nicely been established by the logo and tagline.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/strandbags_store_exterior.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Logo and Identity for Strandbags by Frost* Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Store exterior of new flagship store in Chadstone Shopping Centre near Melbourne.
