From the plaque on this memorial, Helsinki-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.werklig.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Werklig<\/a> created a sexy-ugly custom font that serves as the basis for the identity, giving it a peculiar aesthetic that feels old and unfinished yet has a decidedly modern flair. The triangular umlaut over the &#8220;o&#8221; kicks ass. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.werklig.com\/solutions\/kyro-distillery-company\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Marble by Museum Studio<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_marblerecords.jpg\" alt=\"Marble by Museum Studio\"\/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">On their own, the elements concocted by Stockholm-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.museumstudio.se\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Museum Studio<\/a> for Parisian indie record label, <a href=\"http:\/\/marble.fm\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Marble<\/a>, are awkward and almost unpleasant but when they come together in the album covers they are pretty awesome. And awkward and almost unpleasant too but it&#8217;s that <em>peculiarity<\/em> that makes this identity work.

There is not much science to this one: the &#8220;I&#8221; spills into the &#8220;L&#8221; in different, loopy ways. That&#8217;s it.
