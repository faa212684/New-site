Designed by Nashville, TN-based <a href=\"http:\/\/peckandco.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Peck &amp; Company<\/a>, the identity features an illustration with an unruly hairdo of its own, beckoning customers perched from a log, and proves that anything can be made classier and cooler with foil stamping. The pelican is complemented by what looks like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.myfonts.com\/fonts\/linotype\/alternate-gothic-lt\/?refby=ucllc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Alternate Gothic<\/a> typeset in a lot of uppercase and in a bunch of different serving styles. Overall, the choice of materials and diverse typographic treatments give the barbershop a modern-day Victorian look with a buzz. <a href=\"http:\/\/peckandco.com\/mercer-supply-co\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Cooke Curtis &amp; Co. by The District<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_cookecurtis.jpg\" alt=\"Cooke Curtis &amp; Co. by The District\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.cookecurtis.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cooke Curtis &amp; Co.<\/a> is a residential property estate agent based in Cambridge, England, established in 2015 with an unexpected &mdash; for the industry &mdash; contemporary identity designed by local firm <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thedistrict.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The District<\/a>. Fully typeset in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.myfonts.com\/fonts\/linotype\/avenir\/?refby=ucllc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Avenir<\/a>, the identity is meant to subtly allude to brickwork, which isn&#8217;t evident but I&#8217;m all for a flexible, playful visual system. (An animated GIF at the project link shows better how the typography beeps and bops). The applications, all in black and white, have a bold elegance to them while the shifting typography adds a bouncy, controlled rhythm. These folks could list my property long time. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thedistrict.co.uk\/cooke-curtis-co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a> <span class=\"gray_70\">(<\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/bpando.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Via BP&amp;O<\/a><span class=\"gray_70\">)<\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Chandra by Oddds<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_chandra.jpg\" alt=\"Chandra by Oddds\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/chandrastore\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Chandra<\/a> is a jewelry and apparel fashion brand established in Switzerland, designed by Trang and Aur\u00e9lien Spiegelberg. In contrast to the barbershop&#8217;s rugged pelican, Chandra features a delicate (and totes adorbs) line drawing of a cat with a rose on its head, designed by Singapore-based <a href=\"http:\/\/oddds.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Oddds<\/a>. (Check out the rest of their work and site presentation while you are there; pretty sweet.) The big, happy eyes of the cat and resting happy face add a cheerful vibe to the identity that is otherwise minimally elegant and restrained. Once more, foil stamping does the trick and looks particularly good on the black and orange-hued stocks. The extra loosely tracked lowercase serif is the only questionable element but everything else makes me purr with joy. <a href=\"http:\/\/oddds.com\/chandra\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"A wealth of foil stamping and strong typography to end the week with work from Nashville, Cambridge, and Singapore&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[1244,580,711],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4506"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4506"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4506\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4506"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4506"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4506"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
