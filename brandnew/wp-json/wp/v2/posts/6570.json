The identity and packaging, designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.makebardo.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">makebardo<\/a> (who also designed the identity for Cargo Brewery, featured on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_171.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Friday Likes 171<\/a>), is a beautiful combination of elements, starting with the custom wordmark that defies any current trends in logo or craft beer packaging. I would say it&#8217;s more of a throwback. The packaging very evidently and proudly sports some New Zealand iconography, like the fern and a stamp with the southern cross. The typography throughout is excellent and the way the elements are rearranged and resized across the different applications as it maintains a crisp consistency is great. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/64474877\/Waitiri-Beer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Sorry Mom by We Are B\u00fcro B\u00fcro<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_sorrymom.jpg\" alt=\"Sorry Mom by We Are B\u00fcro B\u00fcro\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.sorrymomtattoo.de\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sorry Mom<\/a> is a tattoo studio in Braunschweig, Germany, with the best name a tattoo studio could have.

The applications all look nice and calm, making the studio feel less rebellious and grungy and more like an art gallery slash German engineering lab where you get to walk out with bitchin&#8217; tattoos. Sure, it&#8217;s a little hipstery but if you can&#8217;t be hipstery with a tattoo studio identity then that&#8217;s no world I want to be part of. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/60297559\/Sorry-Mom-Tattoo-Studio\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Kosmo&#8217;s Q by Joel Schierloh<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_kosmosq.jpg\" alt=\"Kosmo's Q by Joel Schierloh\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/kosmosq.com\/\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kosmo&#8217;s Q<\/a> is both a line of BBQ rubs, sauces, and injections, as well as the brand of professional BBQ competitor Darian Kozz, who has been competing for about 15 years and started selling his sauces to help pay for competition travel costs and fees.

The inline in the logo provides just enough texture to the typography to satisfy the need for flaming graphic and the pattern is all kinds of kitschy in a good way. The identity has a great lowbrow-yet-refined aesthetic that&#8217;s perfect for grilling aficionados. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/joelowenschierloh.com\/kosmosq\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"From elegant to playful to sizzling typography, we have you covered this week, with work from Queenstown, Hamburg, and Oklahoma City&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[69,11,26],"tags":[1454,184,1249],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6570"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=6570"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6570\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=6570"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=6570"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=6570"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
