Spain&#8217;s Real Madrid is the current champion and the team that has won the most titles in the League&#8217;s history. For the 2018 &#8211; 19 season and planned through 2021, UEFA Champions League is introducing a new identity designed by <a href=\"https:\/\/design.studio\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DesignStudio<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/crXHGvSEg-U\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Introduction to the new look.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>Crafted from light, the new starball is the centrepiece of the brand identity.<br \/><br \/>It frames and illuminates the spectacular moments that transcend sport &#8211; allowing the brand to scale from the artful flick of a player&#8217;s ankle, to a pulsating stadium.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/design.studio\/work\/uefachampionsleague\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DesignStudio project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/uefa_champions_league_starball_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Identity for UEFA Champions League by DesignStudio\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/uefa_champions_league_starball_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Identity for UEFA Champions League by DesignStudio\" \/>\n<figcaption>Starball.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video controls controlsList=\"nodownload\" poster=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/uefa_champions_league_starball_motion_slow.jpg\" autoplay loop muted playsinline><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/uefa_champions_league_starball_motion_slow.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Starball in slow motion.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>To capture and immortalise the action, the movement of the starball is inspired by iconic moments and thrilling performances, such as Mario Mand\u017euki\u0107&#8217;s overhead goal from the 2017 final.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/design.studio\/work\/uefachampionsleague\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DesignStudio project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video controls controlsList=\"nodownload\" poster=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/uefa_champions_league_starball_source_02.jpg\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/uefa_champions_league_starball_source_02.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<hr \/>\n<div class=\"video-container\"><video controls controlsList=\"nodownload\" poster=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/uefa_champions_league_starball_source_01.jpg\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/uefa_champions_league_starball_source_01.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Sources for Starball animation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Like yesterday&#8217;s post <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/new_identity_for_uefa_europa_league_by_turquoise.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">about the UEFA Europa League<\/a>, I&#8217;ll start off by saying that I have never watched this so there is no point of reference to what has come before but if I had to choose whether to start watching or not based on this new look, the answer would be 100% yes. The new identity revolves &#8212; literally and metaphorically &#8212; around a new rendition of the League&#8217;s &#8220;starball&#8221; icon that was introduced way back in 1991 and that remains unchanged as the logo proper. The new starball &#8212; like yesterday&#8217;s wave graphic &#8212; drives the identity and this one does so in a beautiful way, with a super thin, translucent, spherical interpretation of the icon that can rotate slowly on its own or burst along with slow motion highlights. What I love the most about the animation is how the star shapes shift from being translucent to slightly opaque as they rotate. It&#8217;s a great bit of animation.<\/p>\n<blockquote>Evening matches mean that a dark blue palette was already a distinguishing feature of the brand. We added contemporary, vivid highlights inspired by the shifting tones of a European night sky.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/design.studio\/work\/uefachampionsleague\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DesignStudio project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/uefa_champions_league_color_palette_sky_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Identity for UEFA Champions League by DesignStudio\" \/>\n<figcaption>Color palette.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The color palette plays a big role in making the identity feel &#8220;premium&#8221; and like an elite competition, almost like an expensive Formula 1 event but less douchey. In static and in motion the identity does a great job in keeping an overall dark blue presence and infusing it subtly with sparks of the bright colors in the palette.<\/p>\n<blockquote>In collaboration with Fontsmith, we created a new light weight font of the brand&#8217;s existing typeface. The new lighter weight reflects the precision and skill of elite club football.<br \/><br \/>We use centred typography with an emphasis on wide tracking, to express the grandeur and scale of the competition.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/design.studio\/work\/uefachampionsleague\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DesignStudio project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/uefa_champions_league_font.png\" alt=\"New Identity for UEFA Champions League by DesignStudio\" \/>\n<figcaption>Custom font.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video controls controlsList=\"nodownload\" poster=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/uefa_champions_league_starball_and_type.jpg\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/uefa_champions_league_starball_and_type.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Starball with type.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Unlike yesterday&#8217;s slab-spike-bonanza font, this is a lovely and elegant sans serif with a lot of great little details, like the slightly tapered &#8220;M&#8221; and that &#8220;6&#8221;. The light contrast in thicks and thins could have been terrible but the balance is perfectly crafted.<\/p>\n<blockquote>In collaboration with our CGI partners, we designed and built a bespoke stadium and sprawling metropolis that takes inspiration from the European cities that host the competition.<br \/><br \/>The stadium walkways are drawn from a five-pointed star, and the architectural features are inspired by the iconic curves of the trophy handle.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/design.studio\/work\/uefachampionsleague\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DesignStudio project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/uefa_champions_league_old_stadium.jpg\" alt=\"New Identity for UEFA Champions League by DesignStudio\" \/>\n<figcaption>For reference: the OLD stadium and Starball graphics.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The previous starball-stadium graphics were already ambitious but this new one is like a Luc Besson world from <em>Valerian<\/em>.

For now, though, it all looks good, exciting, sophisticated, and well thought-out as an identity that needs to live everywhere from print ads to broadcast graphics on YouTube on a phone.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"First played in 1955 (then known as the European Cup), UEFA Champions League is the top-tier annual football competition in Europe with the top clubs of each European league competing for the ultimate European bragging rights. 22 teams qualify in&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[12,26,87],"tags":[491,292,1169,932,369,476,208,586],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6615"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=6615"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6615\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=6615"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=6615"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=6615"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
