It&#8217;s a collection of limited edition souvenirs created by leading Scottish designers and artists collaborating with local producers and crafters. The identity has been designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.graphicalhouse.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Graphical House<\/a> and features one of the loveliest weave logos I have seen in a while. It&#8217;s delicate, it looks crafted, it has a great hand-made feel to it, and it looks fantastic in gold. Paired with the thin-stroked hexagon shape with its medal-like type, gives the two badges a great &#8220;official&#8221; look. There is also a lot go black-and-white applications that lose the elegance of the gold on tan color palette but, still, that weave icon is to swoon for. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.graphicalhouse.co.uk\/projects\/scotland-can-make-it\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">La Tr&oacute;cola by Andr&eacute;s Guerrero<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_latrocola.jpg\" alt=\"La Tr&oacute;cola by Andr&eacute;s Guerrero\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">Consisting of four members, <a href=\"http:\/\/latrocola.com\/compania\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">La Tr&oacute;cola<\/a> is an alternative circus act performing in Spain with a dose of humor and unconventional methods. There isn&#8217;t much to the identity but, BUT, the logo is doing a flip. And it&#8217;s awesome. It does suffer from some readability, specially if you are not used to the &#8220;La&#8221;s and &#8220;El&#8221;s of Spanish but this captures the idea and spirit of the company quite well. Its deadpan use of a sans serif rotated in increments of 45 degrees is what makes it work &mdash; the upside down &#8220;&Oacute;&#8221; is just downright hilarious (if you are into accent and typography humor). <a href=\"http:\/\/andresguerrero.es\/226460\/2842779\/work\/la-trocola-circo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project here<\/strong><\/a><\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Kinfolk Gathering by Danny Demers<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_kinfolkgathering.jpg\" alt=\"Kinfolk Gathering by Danny Demers\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">Portland, OR-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kinfolk.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kinfolk<\/a> magazine organizes workshops and dinners, Gatherings, hosted by different community members from around the world based on a specific theme.
