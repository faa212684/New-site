We won&#8217;t go into nomination strategies on Brand New, but we can certainly get into the logo that the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.democrats.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Democratic National Committee<\/a> has nominated as its best candidate to carry the party and its cadre of politicos gunning for the seats in the upcoming primaries and beyond.

We create change that matters. Ours is a party of ideas and ideals, of policies and people, history and purpose.<br \/><br \/>So call it what you will &mdash; this new identity for our party captures the spirit that unites us all.

(Chip Somodevilla \/ Getty Images)<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m all for simplicity and directness, but I wonder if this crosses the line from simple to simpleton. I mean, it&#8217;s hard to argue against a properly centered &#8220;D&#8221; within an equally weighted stroked circle. It&#8217;s properly done. It would require some really sucky design skills to screw it up. But even then it&#8217;s kind of a let down. I salute the effort of moving away from donkeys and flags and the red-white-and-blue palette has been dialed down with just enough red in the tagline to remind you of it. I do like the typography and the choice of a bookish sans serif, it looks strong and contemporary. I&#8217;m surprised it&#8217;s not Archer, which has suffered from overuse in 2010 and would have been the obvious choice here. But not to leave Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones unpaid, there is a little bit of Gotham underneath.<\/p>\n<p>The review may sound a little harsh for a simple logo and it probably is, especially when you consider how bad or ugly this could have been a year or two ago when political identity was the least innovative market.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to Paul Zolandz for first tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_100916a_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_100916a_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_100916a_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_100916a_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,81,26],"tags":[128,314,40,42],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1196"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1196"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1196\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1196"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1196"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1196"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
