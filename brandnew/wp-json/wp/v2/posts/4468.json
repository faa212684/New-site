It had a decent, if oversized, TW monogram with a notch (natch) and a good looking wordmark but it was mostly generic. The new logo has a much more proprietary aesthetic with a large &#8220;W&#8221; where each stroke is made of different patterns (meant to relate to textures you would find in the key of an infographic). What makes this work better in practice than in theory are the alternating light and dark textures that add a sense of dimensionality to the otherwise flat W. It makes for a great icon and shorthand for the logo. The wordmark is typeset in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.myfonts.com\/fonts\/fontfont\/bau-pro\/?refby=ucllc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FF Bau<\/a>, which I think is a very underrated and underused sans serif. The W monogram and &#8220;w&#8221; in the name aligning (although not to the exact same degree) is a nice touch.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/138720873?title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Patterns as user interface.

The only questionable choice is the heavy use of a serif, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.swisstypefaces.com\/fonts\/romain\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Romain<\/a>, for all headlines. It feels too conservative or old school like a 1970s print ad that clashes against how contemporary the patterns and FF Bau are. Nonetheless, this a great project based on the strength and texture of the &#8220;W&#8221; monogram alone.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Launched in 2013 &mdash; although it existed previously under the name of Planner &mdash; Teamweek is a project planner and team calendar, developed by a team in Estonia.
