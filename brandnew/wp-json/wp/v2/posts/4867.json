Numerous features were added to the site as it developed, helping it grow steadily over the years. While that website still exists for its original purpose, it has also become a major web store. In 2011, CMON entered the board and tabletop game market and is well known for its focus on high-quality games featuring amazing miniatures and fun, engaging gameplay. Thanks to the support of its fans and stakeholders, CMON has published many critically acclaimed games, including Zombicide, Arcadia Quest, Blood Rage, Rum &amp; Bones, XenoShyft and more. Many of those titles have inspired successful sequels and expansions. CMON also publishes two established miniature game lines: Dark Age and Wrath of Kings. Other notable games in CMON&#8217;s library include Krosmaster Quest, Sheriff of Nottingham and The Grizzled to name a few. Our games can be found all over the world in all major markets and in multiple languages.&#8221;<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cmon_logo.png\" alt=\"New Name and Logo for CMON done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cmon_booth_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Name and Logo for CMON done In-house\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cmon_booth_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Name and Logo for CMON done In-house\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cmon_booth_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Name and Logo for CMON done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>CMON booth at Gen Con.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"(Est. 2001, previously CoolMiniOrNot) &quot;CMON began in 2001 as CoolMiniOrNot.com, a community rating site where anyone could submit pictures of miniatures to be voted on by their peers.
