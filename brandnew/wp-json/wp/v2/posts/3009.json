It was thus designed an alphabet of geometric signs, due to an imaginary town typically Italian: the forms freely take up again some figurative archetypes of the Italian city of Bologna, and more specifically (such as walls, brick mosaic, the lily and the heraldic banner of the cross citizen, etc.).<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.matteobartoli.com\/portfolio\/e-bologna\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Matteo Bartoli case study<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/g0pQm0PMvQU\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Explanation of how the logo works.

There are aspects of it that I like and others that irk me. (I&#8217;m not even going to go into the merits or demerits of this being the result of a contest &mdash; the contest happened and this came out, end of story). The underlying concept is quite solid: a flexible, &#8220;participatory&#8221; identity based on geometric shapes you might see around the city of Bologna as stained glass, wall or door decorations, medieval inscriptions or drawings, etc. Even if they are not shapes directly pulled from specific sources, the aesthetics are there. Typing in a word <a href=\"http:\/\/ebologna.it\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">in the microsite for the new identity<\/a> lets you see the concept in action and yields you your own &#8220;&eacute; Bologna&#8221; logo where your word and the wordmark make a new logo, i.e., &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/ebologna.it\/?text=Ponies&#038;color=b23636\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ponies is Bologna<\/a>&#8220;.<\/p>\n<p>The generated logos are interesting and intriguing as visual doodads but as identifiers of a city, I am not 100% convinced. The transparency\/overlaid effect, to me (and it&#8217;s hard to pinpoint exactly why), is what takes it from a serious proposition of city branding to just a cool graphic exercise.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/e_bologna_postcards.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for City of Bologna by Matteo Bartoli and Michele Pastore\" \/>\n<figcaption>Postcards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/e_bologna_tourist_guide.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for City of Bologna by Matteo Bartoli and Michele Pastore\" \/>\n<figcaption>Tourist guide.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/e_bologna_book_newspaper.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for City of Bologna by Matteo Bartoli and Michele Pastore\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sample use on event materials.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">The applications are attractive, though, and I can see the potential in it &mdash; it is particularly and surprisingly convincing when used small as shown in the event materials. Overall, it&#8217;s a curious solution that perhaps could have gone through one more layer of refinement in how the icons are rendered and it&#8217;s still not clear when or how the city of Bologna will use it but as fodder for us, it&#8217;s molto bene.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"A quick description of Bologna, courtesy of Wikipedia: &quot;[It] is the largest city (and the capital) of Emilia-Romagna Region in Italy.
