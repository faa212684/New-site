The original plans to hold the competition in 2013 were abandoned due to financial problems. It will replace the one-day international competition, the ICC Champions Trophy, which was held in 2013 for the last time. The ICC has also announced plans to stage the second Test championship in India in Feb-March 2021. The top four ranked teams on December 31, 2016 &#8211; the cut-off date set by the International Cricket Council (ICC) &#8211; will play the three-match Test championship between the first and third weeks of June 2017. There will be two semi-finals and the winners will play the final. The ICC is taking extra care to ensure that the 10 Test-playing teams do not manipulate the qualification period by adding\/cancelling\/postponing series, particularly in the last 24 months of the qualification period.&#8221; (Source: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/ICC_World_Test_Championship\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wikipedia<\/a>)<\/p><!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/icc_world_test_championship_logo_detail.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for ICC World Test Championship by Bulletproof\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/icc_world_test_championship_things.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for ICC World Test Championship by Bulletproof\" \/>\n<figcaption>Not exactly sure what these are.
