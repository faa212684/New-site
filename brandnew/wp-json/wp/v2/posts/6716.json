All events, including the NYC Pride March, are organized by  Heritage of Pride, a volunteer-managed, non-partisan, tax-exempt, nonprofit corporation formed in 1984, building on the work of the Christopher Street Liberation Day Committee, that organized the first march in 1970 to bring attention to 1969&#8217;s Stonewall Riots. Celebrated this past June and attracting approximately 2.1 million to its myriad events and march, NYC Pride 2018 revolved around the theme of &#8220;Defiantly Different&#8221; with a campaign and identity designed by New York-based <a href=\"http:\/\/grey.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Grey<\/a> in collaboration with art director <a href=\"http:\/\/bryceaviano.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bryce Aviano<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>&#8220;Defiantly Different&#8221; speaks to the unyielding individuality within the LGBTQIA+ community, and stands as a rallying cry of generations who set the groundwork for equality, the next wave of members prepared to strive in new ventures, and each distinctive individual throughout. The creative showcases a wide selection of defiantly different community members.<br \/><br \/>Part of this celebration was the creation of a custom dynamic typeface that holds multiple forms of each letter, representing the multifaceted diversity of the LGBTQIA+ community. A simple unifying grid a was used to guide the letterforms and from there, a range of 3-5 forms were created for each glyph, allowing for each piece of typography to be as visually diverse as the people it is speaking to.<\/blockquote><h3>Grey provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nyc_pride_2018_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2018 NYC Pride by Grey\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nyc_pride_2018_defiantly_different_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2018 NYC Pride by Grey\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nyc_pride_2018_defiantly_different_logo.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2018 NYC Pride by Grey\" \/>\n<figcaption>Theme logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The 2017 logo was surprisingly unexciting and could have easily been a U.S. Open tennis tournament. As if to make up for it, this year&#8217;s logo and identity swing to the opposite end of the spectrum with a wild identity built around a custom font that demanded plenty of attention. Not attractive in the traditional sense (or any sense) the font is successful in &#8212; as clich\u00e9 as it may be given the context &#8212; its diversity. The variations of each letter demonstrate that the same letter can be straight, round, angled, weird, weirder, and\/or even traditional&#8230; a nice, simple metaphor for the variations celebrated by the LGBTQ community. The event and theme logos work because, perhaps confusingly, they <em>don&#8217;t<\/em> work: They are awkward, weirdly balanced, and slightly hard to read if taken in without tolerance but, with a little effort, it&#8217;s all perfectly fine&#8230; and visually exuberant.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nyc_pride_2018_font.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2018 NYC Pride by Grey\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nyc_pride_2018_font_02.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2018 NYC Pride by Grey\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nyc_pride_2018_font_03.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2018 NYC Pride by Grey\" \/>\n<figcaption>Custom font.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nyc_pride_2018_titles.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2018 NYC Pride by Grey\" \/>\n<figcaption>Various event titles.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nyc_pride_2018_promos_01a.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2018 NYC Pride by Grey\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nyc_pride_2018_promos_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2018 NYC Pride by Grey\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nyc_pride_2018_promos_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2018 NYC Pride by Grey\" \/>\n<figcaption>Promos.

Nonetheless, as a one-time campaign that spans dozens of events and has to stand out in one of the most visually noisy cities in the world, this was an arresting and well-balanced identity.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"NYC Pride is the annual, week-long series of events in New York, NY, that celebrate the LGBTQIA+ community.
