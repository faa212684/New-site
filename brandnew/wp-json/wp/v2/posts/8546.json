Their passion and mission was to create a &#8216;museum without walls&#8217; and to make accessible to a large reading public the world of art and the research of top scholars. To reflect its international outlook the name for the company linked the rivers flowing through London and New York, represented in its logo by two dolphins symbolizing friendship and intelligence, one facing east, one west, suggesting a connection between the Old World and the New. Today, still an independent, family-owned company, Thames &amp; Hudson is one of the world&#8217;s leading publishers of illustrated books with over 2,000 titles in print. We publish high-quality books across \u200eall areas of visual creativity: the arts (fine, applied, decorative, performing), architecture, design, photography, fashion, film and music, and also archaeology, history and popular culture. Our children&#8217;s books list is also expanding. Headquartered in London, we have a sister company in New York and subsidiary sales and distribution companies in Hong Kong and Paris. Today the group employs 150 staff in London and a further 65 around the world.&#8221;<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/\/thames_and_hudson_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Thames &amp; Hudson by Pentagram\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/\/thames_and_hudson_cartouche.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Thames &amp; Hudson by Pentagram\" \/>\n<figcaption>Cartouche.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/395941607?title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0&#038;autoplay=1&#038;loop=1&#038;autopause=0&#038;background=1&#038;muted=1\" width=\"360\" height=\"203\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Full to shorthand logo animation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/\/thames_and_hudson_logo_assets.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Thames &amp; Hudson by Pentagram\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo assets.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/\/thames_and_hudson_spine.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Thames &amp; Hudson by Pentagram\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logos on book.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/\/thames_and_hudson_color_paletter.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Thames &amp; Hudson by Pentagram\" \/>\n<figcaption>Color palette.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/\/thames_and_hudson_business_card.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Thames &amp; Hudson by Pentagram\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business card.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/\/thames_and_hudson_stationery.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Thames &amp; Hudson by Pentagram\" \/>\n<figcaption>Letterhead.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/\/thames_and_hudson_catalog.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Thames &amp; Hudson by Pentagram\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/\/thames_and_hudson_catalog_detail.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Thames &amp; Hudson by Pentagram\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/\/thames_and_hudson_catalog_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Thames &amp; Hudson by Pentagram\" \/>\n<figcaption>Catalogs.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/\/thames_and_hudson_tote_bag.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Thames &amp; Hudson by Pentagram\" \/>\n<figcaption>Tote bags.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"(Est. 1949) &#8220;Thames &amp; Hudson was founded in 1949 by Walter and Eva Neurath.
