To call attention to the network&#8217;s brand promise of more, the logo features bold &#8220;M&aacute;s&#8221; typography to contrast the thinner &#8220;Uni&#8221; font that precedes it.<br \/><br \/>&#8220;UniM&aacute;s&#8217; new logo and graphic design truly exemplify the M&aacute;s Generation &#8211; Hispanic Millennial trendsetters,&#8221; said Ruth Gaviria, senior vice president, Corporate Marketing at Univision.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/id\/100366852\/Univision_Communications_Inc_Teams_Up_with_Troika_to_Launch_UniMaacutes_Brand\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press Release<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/unimas_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"UniM&aacute;s Logo and On-Air\" \/><\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"574\" height=\"323\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/v1SR_us6Jz8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Logo animation and sound mnemonic.<\/p>\n<p>The previous logo and name were fairly trite so nothing there will be missed. The new name is a little awkward. It makes sense, it&#8217;s readable, and it doesn&#8217;t try to apply the &#8220;Xtreme&#8221; filter that is sometimes used for millennials but it ends up sounding either corporate or like a pharmaceutical company. The logo is also a little awkward too but manages to work. The icon has the right idea of taking a cue from the main Univision logo by mimicking the left-side of its iconic &#8220;U&#8221; and then, well, going &#8220;Xtreme&#8221; on the right side with an ambiguously shaped &#8220;U&#8221;. It definitely feels edgy and youthful even if it&#8217;s impossible to tell what it&#8217;s supposed to be or look like. The wordmark borrows Univision&#8217;s &#8220;uni&#8221; typography &mdash; being smarter about it than the other Univision member, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/galavisin_lacks_vision.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Galavision<\/a> &mdash; and then adds the &#8220;M&aacute;s&#8221; heavy, italic typography at the same angle as the icon above (the &#8220;M&#8221; also has the same rounded top as the icon, fwiw). The logo is not particularly elegant or fetching but it gets the right message across: this is part of Univision but it&#8217;s edgier. And, as usual, Troika&#8217;s strength lies in its experience and visual prowess for on-air packages and this one helps elevate the logo and further establish the attitude for the younger demographic.<\/p>\n<blockquote>The network&#8217;s on-air brand identity features vibrant colors and sharp 2D graphics to stand out against competing 3D network graphic packages. The identity is rooted in croppings of the UniM&aacute;s logo to create frames for footage, graphics, and information.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/id\/100366852\/Univision_Communications_Inc_Teams_Up_with_Troika_to_Launch_UniMaacutes_Brand\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press Release<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe src=\"http:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/56728492?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0\" width=\"574\" height=\"323\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Montage of new on-air look.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/56729566?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0\" width=\"574\" height=\"323\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Launch campaign spot.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/unimas_ad.jpg\" alt=\"UniM&aacute;s Logo and On-Air\" \/><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_130114_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_130114_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"285\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_130114_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_130114_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"285\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_130114_config_03.xml&#038;xyz=poll_130114_votes_03.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"285\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv3\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv3\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,66,26],"tags":[153,290,328,429],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2284"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2284"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2284\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2284"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2284"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2284"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
