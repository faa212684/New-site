That&#8217;s what the audience digs. That&#8217;s what the channel is all about. Bringing that to life became really exciting with the exploration of what a new idea is, and how an overlap of talents could be expressed. Collaborating with Hal Wolverton, Alicia brought the positioning to life with the name SEED. Then the look, feel and behavior of the brand began to take shape through the interface, apps and social interactions of the new television brand.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.becreativemgt.com\/portfolio\/cw-seed\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Be Creative Management blog post<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cwseed_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Online Look for CW Seed by johnson + wolverton\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/video\/embed?video_id=10201376468681305\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Launch video.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">While there isn&#8217;t much to see on this project and it doesn&#8217;t quite meet all of my review requirements I thought there was something interesting about its visual presence: edgy, a little dark and disturbed, overtly young. The off-register approach to the logo is also appealing as a technique to use on screen as taken from print &mdash; not that some TV don&#8217;t get jacked up and get their RGB channels out of synch but, at least for  us designers, it&#8217;s more of a print maneuver. Plus, as more brands commit strongly to delivering content online &mdash; like HBO GO &mdash; the need for better and more cohesive and efficient experiences will be of great importance, starting with all these channels&#8217; branding.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Launched last week, CW Seed is a new digital-only network available online and on mobile devices created by the 18-to-34-year-old-obsessed CW Network.
