Certainly not as popular as the Olympics, but it is a significant sporting event for athletes and host cities. In 2018, the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gc2018.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">XXI Commonwealth Games<\/a> will be played in the Gold Coast in Queensland, Australia. The emblem for the 2018 games was unveiled earlier this month and was designed by WiteKite (no website available).<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/xxi_commonwealth_games_logo_history.gif\" alt=\"2018 Commonwealth Games Logo\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">The underwhelming history of Commonwealth logos since 2006 when they started using the equally bad Commonwealth Olympic-rings-wannabe torch thing (officially, the Commonwealth Games Federation Flag).<\/p>\n<blockquote>Inspired by the iconic soaring skyline and stunning ocean side location, this graphic is bursting with youthful vibrance and energy, providing a fitting invitation for all to come and experience the joy of competing in such a wonderful place. The clear reference to such a unique landscape and location provides the perfect backdrop to promote the spirit of athletic endeavour.<br \/><br \/>The design features a heroic burst of athletic energy, full of the dynamism of elite competition, yet open to the warmth and spirit so unique to the &#8216;friendly games.&#8217;<br \/><br \/>Centred upon fluid representations of a gymnast, a hurdler and a swimmer, it reflects the depth of heritage and deep humanity of the Games as this young and vibrant city prepares to welcome all to its shores.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gc2018.com\/flux-content\/GC2018\/docs\/The-Brand-Story.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Brand Story (PDF)<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/xxi_commonwealth_games_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"2018 Commonwealth Games Logo\" \/><\/p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/63277595?portrait=0&amp;color=ffffff\" width=\"574\" height=\"323\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Logo explanation and process video.

Quite the contrary, all have been fairly awful. And this latest iteration isn&#8217;t much of an improvement. Despite having the right intentions and the proper concept and ambition in place, the final emblem is an awkward blend of far too many things: The Gold Coast skyscrapers! A swimmer! A hurdler! A gymnast! Land! Sea! Sun! It&#8217;s unfortunately not an appealing graphic to look at. The only saving grace for it is how it&#8217;s used in animation, like a crystal wind chime that catches reflections and shows glimpses of the athlete figures as it spins; it&#8217;s still crudely executed, but there is something there. The wordmark in the logo is pleasant and the swooping &#8220;2&#8221; has a nice effect, but the supporting fluid-drawn-in-the-sand font &mdash; not sure if it&#8217;s custom or out of the box &mdash; (that you can see in the PDF linked in the quote) is far too unsophisticated for such an event. Somebody needs to step up &mdash; at the organization level &mdash; and lead the Commonwealth to better branding.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to Cale Davis for first tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_130410_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_130410_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_130410_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_130410_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,26,87],"tags":[294,857,617,858],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2418"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2418"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2418\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2418"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2418"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2418"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
