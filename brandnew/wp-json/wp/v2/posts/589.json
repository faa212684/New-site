Also, the criteria for entering is somewhat limiting: <a href=\"http:\/\/advertising.microsoft.com\/europe\/mouse\/rules\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Advertising that appeared <em>only<\/em> in a Microsoft-run web site like MSN or XBOX Live<\/a>. The one uptick to these awards is that the first-prize winners in each category get automatically entered into the Cannes <a href=\"http:\/\/www.canneslions.com\/enter\/categories.cfm?id=5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cyber Lions<\/a> competition &mdash; a big deal if there ever was one. Seeing that a coveted &#8220;Lion&#8221; award was the ultimate bait, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.brandguardians.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brand Guardians<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.johnsonbanks.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">johnson banks<\/a> (who are the firm responsible for the playful identity), focused on fauna-influenced naming and arrived at &#8220;Mouse&#8221; as a better, catchier and more memorable name for these awards.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mouse_detail.gif\" alt=\"Mouse Logo, Detail\" \/><\/p>\n<p>I haven&#8217;t expressed sheer effusiveness about a logo on Brand New before, but I think this warrants it: I <em>love<\/em> it. I would even call it &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/interactive_television.php\">brilliantly executed<\/a>&#8221; and stand behind it 100%. I suspect many will disagree but that&#8217;s the least of my worries. The biggest compliment I can pay this logo is that it makes me smile as the details are revealed: You read the word mouse&hellip; you see the white mouse&hellip; you see the big, pink ear&hellip; and finally you see the copyright symbol, the punch line to this sophisticated design joke. I can go on and on about this logo: From the colors, to the type selection (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.linotype.com\/2090\/avenirregnext.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Avenir Next<\/a>), to the overall composition: It all works. It&#8217;s embarrassing to compare this to the old non-logo, with its faux-brush stroke arrow, so I won&#8217;t even go there.<\/p>\n<p>And, to boot, the identity program is equally clever and playful while emphasizing that winning a Mouse could earn you a Lion.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mouse_app_02.gif\" alt=\"Mouse Applications\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mouse_app_03.gif\" alt=\"Mouse Applications\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mouse_app_04.gif\" alt=\"Mouse Applications\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Can a catchy name and identity turn around an awards program? In this case I think it can. I feel that a good name, and something that people can throw around at dinner parties &mdash; &#8220;Why yes, I did win a Mouse last year, thank you for asking&#8221; &mdash; and feel proud about being associated with can do wonders for a flailing effort. So maybe in a couple of years, regardless of your country of residence, you will know about the Mouse awards.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,78,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/589"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=589"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/589\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=589"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=589"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=589"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
