Royal Court recently introduced a new identity designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/lovers.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lovers<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>Our early research highlighted the iconic significance of the Royal Court&#8217;s front of house presence, its &#8216;Royal Court&#8217; letters staring defiantly out into Sloane Square from the balcony. But we had an urge to rip out the red neon inlines and get those letterforms singing more clearly. This destructive spirit got the ball rolling.<br \/><br \/> We went ahead with ripping out the neon, and proceeded to tear apart the cleaned-up wordmark itself. We wanted to see it running amok over and beyond edges, teleporting itself from A to B, to Z, to Q, to R without apologising once along the way.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/lovers.co\/work\/royal-court\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lovers project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/royal_court_theatre_facade.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Royal Court by Lovers\" \/>\n<figcaption>Existing facade.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>Rather than creating a contained logo with a fixed position and traditional exclusion zone, we set about creating an open set of conditions governing radical and flexible application of the logotype across communications. The idea was to suggest a restlessness at the heart of the Royal Court&#8217;s direction, pushing at the edges and scaling differently for different applications.<br \/><br \/>The attitude of abruptness was also translated into a &#8216;gutterless&#8217; grid with no safety barriers between columns. Carving space in this way offered the logo permission to appear, disappear and reappear anywhere it fancied, at any moment.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/lovers.co\/work\/royal-court\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lovers project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/royal_court_theatre_logo_detail_and_grid.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Royal Court by Lovers\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail and grid.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>One of the things I like about this redesign is that the logo change doesn&#8217;t feel too abrupt. The old logo already had some uncommon cropping, tight letterspacing, and a dash of Gill Sans Britishness. The new logo is based on the lettering on the facade of the theater (which is, thankfully, not Gill Sans) and takes the cropping approach to (if not a new angle) greater lengths. (Double-pun!).<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/royal_court_theatre_logo_animation_01.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<hr \/>\n<div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/royal_court_theatre_logo_animation_02.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo configurations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The new logo is pretty straightforward; it&#8217;s a tightly spaced, uppercase sans serif with some quirks, like the slightly off &#8220;R&#8221; and super round &#8220;O&#8221;s that contrast against the more condensed letterforms. The hook on it is that it&#8217;s used cropped, with one end of the logo bleeding off one edge of the layout and the other end appearing from the other edge. It&#8217;s a very basic design exercise but try selling that to a client and you&#8217;ll find very few are wont to do that to their logo, so it&#8217;s almost a thrill to see it in action.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/royal_court_theatre_stationery.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Royal Court by Lovers\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stationery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/royal_court_theatre_tickets.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Royal Court by Lovers\" \/>\n<figcaption>Tickets.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/royal_court_theatre_corp_membership.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Royal Court by Lovers\" \/>\n<figcaption>Corporate membership brochure.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/royal_court_theatre_posters.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Royal Court by Lovers\" \/>\n<figcaption>Posters.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/royal_court_theatre_nonimage_materials.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Royal Court by Lovers\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/royal_court_theatre_nonimage_materials_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Royal Court by Lovers\" \/>\n<figcaption>Materials without play-specific imagery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/royal_court_theatre_tshirt.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Royal Court by Lovers\" \/>\n<figcaption>T-shirt.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">The application on the materials delivers on the promise of an edgy identity without going overboard. There is an overarching sense of tension throughout the materials thanks in part to the split logo but also to the unusual imagery and the unexpected use of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.myfonts.com\/fonts\/fontbureau\/bureau-grot\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bureau Grot<\/a> as the house font that provides a weird (in a good way) contrast to the more geometric logo. Overall, this feels like an alternative theater yet still one with enough reputation, history, and equity.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1956, Royal Court is a theatre in London&apos;s Sloane Square, dedicated to &quot;creating restless, alert, provocative theatre&quot; attracting over 120,000 attendees each year to its original productions.
