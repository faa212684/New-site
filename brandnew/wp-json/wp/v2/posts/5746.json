With such a beautiful hotel and its stunning backdrop, you could use Comic Sans for everything and it would still look good but paired with an appropriate, rugged, unfinished, and rough-around-the-edges aesthetic makes this place quite outstanding. Pairing the clunky-but-awesome script logo with the thin flared sans serif makes for a great combination and all the materials and items are the stuff Instagram dreams are made of. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/52795125\/Anvil-Hotel-Jon-Contino\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Willibald by Concrete<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_willibald.jpg\" alt=\"Willibald by Concrete\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/drinkwillibald.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Willibald<\/a> is a new distillery in southern Ontario, Canada, purposefully positioned as being new instead of the usual old-timey, 8th-generation kind of distillery. The identity and packaging for its first gin have been designed by Toronto-based <a href=\"http:\/\/concrete.ca\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Concrete<\/a> with a super badass 21st century blackletter that is set on a downward angle. I absolutely adore it; it has such a great rhythm and the shapes of the letters are so unique. I could even picture it being rotated counterclockwise to sit horizontally and being a backwards-slanting italic. The wordmark is paired with a monospace sans serif and a bold color palette of black and yellow that really makes this a unique offering within the craft distillery genre. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/concrete.ca\/willibald-farm-distillers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Papersmiths by B<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_papersmiths.jpg\" alt=\"Papersmiths by B\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.papersmiths.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Papersmiths<\/a> is a bookstore, stationery store, homeware store, and all-around-design-y store with two locations &#8212; the original in Bristol, UK, and a new one in London&#8217;s Shoreditch district &#8212; that was started and is run by design studio <a href=\"https:\/\/www.weareb.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">B<\/a>. With the opening of their new store in Shoreditch, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.weareb.co.uk\/archive\/papersmiths-boxpark\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">which is awesomely pink btw<\/a>, they redesigned the identity and apart from featuring a totally groovy serif it revolves around the squiggles that their customers make when testing out pens in the store. The result is an odd combination of bookish serifness and squiggly confetti-ness, all with a Wes Anderson color hue that is kinda irresistible. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.weareb.co.uk\/archive\/papersmiths\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Some pretty great, out of the ordinary, typography-led projects this week with work from New York, Toronto, and Bristol&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[51,11,73,86,26],"tags":[900,633,369,1465],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5746"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=5746"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5746\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=5746"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=5746"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=5746"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
