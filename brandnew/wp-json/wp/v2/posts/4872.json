Here is a follow-up on the new identity from Futurebrand with plenty more images and concepts behind it.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>Sentry realized its brand was not an accurate reflection of who they really were and how they conducted business. The ideas of strength, protection and vigilance were table-stakes in the insurance industry. And the image of a solitary military figure holding a gun felt counter-intuitive to a brand whose core strength was found in the expert conversations it had with customers and the relationships it cultivated. The company&#8217;s identity felt too corporate, conservative, sometimes cold and out-of-step with the times.<\/blockquote><h3>Futurebrand provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sentry_followup_02BN_audit.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Identity for Sentry by Futurebrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Audit of old look.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>So the white man with a gun is not just a random white man with a gun but <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/John_Parker_(captain)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Captain John Parker<\/a>, who &#8220;rallied 77 fellow minutemen to face British troops in the first military encounter in America&#8217;s War for Independence&#8221; and represented the values of Sentry, &#8220;Strength, Protection, and Vigilance.&#8221; That&#8217;s a good back story for a logo but as the image above shows, not much of that was reflected in the materials that looked like default insurance materials. Also, anything with a page-curl effect has to be deleted from existing.<\/p>\n<blockquote>Our logo honors Sentry&#8217;s history of partnership and collaboration. A dual-piece symbol reminiscent of the timeless yin and yang, each side forms one section of a greater &#8216;S&#8217;&#8211;a greater Sentry. Because we know that there are two equal parts to every conversation. So it&#8217;s only fitting that our logo not only celebrates our own identity&#8211; it celebrates the ongoing dialogue we encourage with our customers, too.<\/blockquote><h3>Futurebrand provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sentry_logo.png\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Identity for Sentry by Futurebrand\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sentry_followup_03BBN_newlogo.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Identity for Sentry by Futurebrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail and color variations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>As I concluded in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/new_logo_for_sentry_by_futurebrand.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Friday&#8217;s post<\/a>, the new logo is pretty good, solid, and relevant to the company while also not following today&#8217;s logo trends. The one thing I&#8217;m not sure about is whether it works better in its full rendering where the right quote mark shows some dimension or in its single color versions. While I&#8217;m usually all for simplicity, the shading does help add some life to the marks.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sentry_followup_04BN_branduniverse.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Identity for Sentry by Futurebrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Identity elements.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>Our logo, and the peer-to-peer conversations we use to communicate with our customers, inspired our graphic element. Called &#8220;the quotes,&#8221; it&#8217;s made up of our logo&#8217;s symbol shapes pulled apart as a framing device for more emotive, conversational content. Because when you mean what you say, you put it in quotes. And on the record.<\/blockquote><h3>Futurebrand provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sentry_followup_05BN_concept_thequotes.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Identity for Sentry by Futurebrand\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sentry_followup_06BN_concept_thequotes2.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Identity for Sentry by Futurebrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>&#8220;The quotes&#8221;.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sentry_followup_17BN_businesscard.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Identity for Sentry by Futurebrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business card.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The &#8220;the quotes&#8221; are a good hook to build the identity around, providing a recurring visual device across materials. It&#8217;s a little corny when they are used with things like &#8216;salt and pepper&#8217; or &#8216;peanut butter and jelly&#8217; (shown a few images below) but it works better with photos of people or typography. It&#8217;s well managed how the &#8220;the quotes&#8221; are used larger in contrast to the logo so that they don&#8217;t feel so repetitive when they both appear in the same layout.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sentry_followup_07BN_icon_storytelling.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Identity for Sentry by Futurebrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Illustrations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sentry_followup_08BN_brandbook_cover.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Identity for Sentry by Futurebrand\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sentry_followup_09BN_brandbook_spreads.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Identity for Sentry by Futurebrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brand book.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sentry_followup_10BN_brandbook_sticker.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Identity for Sentry by Futurebrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stickers from brand book.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sentry_followup_11BN_brochure_covers.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Identity for Sentry by Futurebrand\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sentry_followup_12BN_brochure_spreads.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Identity for Sentry by Futurebrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brochure covers and spreads.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sentry_followup_13BN_website.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Identity for Sentry by Futurebrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Website.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sentry_followup_14BN_claim_report_apps.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Identity for Sentry by Futurebrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Claim report app.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sentry_followup_15BN_interior_lobby.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Identity for Sentry by Futurebrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Lobby seating.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sentry_followup_18BN_merchandise.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Identity for Sentry by Futurebrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Mugs.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">Overall, this is a solid corporate redesign that literally gives Sentry a new tone of voice that still feels corporate but that also demonstrates a specific outlook on how they do business and how they want to be perceived, instead of relying on the statue and image of a soldier to do it on their behalf.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"From last Friday&apos;s Noted post on Sentry, it turns out there is a lot more to the story that wasn&apos;t available for release.
