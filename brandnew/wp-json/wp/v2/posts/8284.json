The identity, designed by Mexico City-based <a href=\"http:\/\/byfutura.com\/ target=\"_blank\">Futura<\/a> revolves around an alchemy theme but interpreted through Futura&#8217;s warped design filter which leads to an eclectic combination of typefaces: what looks like an exaggerated version of <a href=\"https:\/\/fonts.adobe.com\/fonts\/tenez\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tenez<\/a> for the logo and an almost cheesy, wedding-invitation-like script for headline typography.  The accompanying illustrations share the lightness and thinness of the typefaces but in general none of the elements are really related except that they &#8212; as if by alchemy &#8212; come together oddly convincingly in the end. And those silver cups are everything. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/byfutura.com\/project\/elixir\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Vauraus by Kuudes<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_vauraus.jpg\" alt=\"Vauraus by Kuudes\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/vauraus.fi\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Vauraus<\/a> is an investment firm in Finland &#8212; their name translates to &#8220;Prosperity&#8221; in English which I bring because I feel like their logo, designed by Helsinki- and Stockholm-based <a href=\"https:\/\/kuudes.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kuudes<\/a>, could easily be a universal symbol for prosperity. I know that that&#8217;s too philosophical and praise-y for a corporate icon but it&#8217;s so simple, minimal, universal, and it looks so damn good as a lapel pin. The rest of the identity is nice and with simple, elegant typography but the highlight is definitely anytime anything goes red-on-red, whether it&#8217;s the lapel pin or the business card. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/37252113\/Vauraus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Gabfoods by Studio Born<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_gabfoods.jpg\" alt=\"Gabfoods by Studio Born\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/gabfoods.net\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gabfoods<\/a> is a gluten-free and sugar-free food emporium in Istanbul, Turkey, making its own granolas, baked goods, spices, and even Kombucha.

Swoon. And that jug of milk. And that granola.
