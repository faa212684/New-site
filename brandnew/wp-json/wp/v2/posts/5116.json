[It] is both the largest LGBTQ celebration and the biggest diversity festival in Denmark with uncompromisable values such as inclusion, tolerance and equality in the very heart of everything we do. Copenhagen Pride wishes to establish itself as the most influential Pride festival in Europe and we have a clear and strong internationalisation strategy to support this vision. As an organisation Copenhagen Pride strives to be the single most important LGBTQ organisation in Denmark and we are a strong and outspoken political organisation who works broadly and cooperates closely with relevant partners in order to achieve results on behalf of LGBTQ people in Denmark. At the same time we want to further strengthen and develop our position as a renowned and familiar culture- and diversity festival with LGBTQ in constant focus.&#8221;<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/copenhagen_pride_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Copenhagen Pride by Poulsen Projects\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/copenhagen_pride_heart.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Copenhagen Pride by Poulsen Projects\" \/>\n<figcaption>Heart icon.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/copenhagen_pride_business_cards.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Copenhagen Pride by Poulsen Projects\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/copenhagen_pride_posters_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Copenhagen Pride by Poulsen Projects\" \/>\n<figcaption>Posters.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/copenhagen_pride_print.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Copenhagen Pride by Poulsen Projects\" \/>\n<figcaption>Print materials.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/copenhagen_pride_tshirt.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Copenhagen Pride by Poulsen Projects\" \/>\n<figcaption>T-shirt.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/copenhagen_pride_bracelet.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Copenhagen Pride by Poulsen Projects\" \/>\n<figcaption>Bracelet.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/copenhagen_pride_banner.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Copenhagen Pride by Poulsen Projects\" \/>\n<figcaption>Banner.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/copenhagen_pride_protest_signs.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Copenhagen Pride by Poulsen Projects\" \/>\n<figcaption>Protest signs.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"(Est. 1996) &quot;Copenhagen Pride is a non-profit organisation run by volunteers.
