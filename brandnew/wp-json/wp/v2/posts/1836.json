Lake Tahoe has two main cities, Tahoe City to the North on the California side and South Lake Tahoe on the South still in California but a stone&#8217;s throw away from Nevada, making it more attractive to the work-hard-play-hard crowd. In charge of the South side is the Lake Tahoe Visitors Authority who are intent of making their side <em>the<\/em> side to be in. Changing the destination name from Lake Tahoe South Shore to simply <a href=\"http:\/\/tahoesouth.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tahoe South<\/a>, they have introduced a new identity designed by San Francisco, CA-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.duncanchannon.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Duncan\/Channon<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>The strategy embraces the truth of the destination, that it&#8217;s the place for the up-all-day-and-night visitor, and the brand identity celebrates this spirit.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.duncanchannon.com\/2012\/02\/tahoe-south-brand-launch\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Duncan\/Channon Case Study<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tahoe_south_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"Tahoe South\" \/><\/p>\n<p>I have recently stayed away from doing full reviews and opinions of destination branding because most aren&#8217;t that inspiring or different, but this one got my attention. First, because the old logo was quite decent, with a sophisticated if slightly generic icon, and some generously spaced Mrs Eaves. But the new logo has a very unique energy and roughness to it that, even if also slightly generic in that any fun, rough-and-tumble-outdoorsy destination could adopt, makes it boldly unique and different. Executed by lettering experts <a href=\"http:\/\/underware.nl\/logotypes\/Tahoe_South\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Underware<\/a>, the logo has a great presence with bold, hard-angled strokes and it pairs beautifully with properly curated photography and it stands out nicely on the website, whether it&#8217;s next to a few <a href=\"http:\/\/tahoesouth.com\/play\/gaming_casinos\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">douchebag-ey-looking dudes<\/a> or shots of the lake itself. This is probably not the best destination branding job of the year, but definitely one of the best examples of commissioned lettering with a strong purpose.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tahoe_south_banners.jpg\" alt=\"Tahoe South\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tahoe_south_tshirt.jpg\" alt=\"Tahoe South\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tahoe_south_winter.jpg\" alt=\"Tahoe South\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">New winter out-of-home campaign, with illustration by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kustaasaksi.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kustaa Saksi<\/a>.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_120214_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_120214_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"574\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,64,26],"tags":[108,209,54,689],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1836"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1836"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1836\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1836"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1836"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1836"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
