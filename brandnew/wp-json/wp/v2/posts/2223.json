This easily-replicated initiative involves the whole community to provide safe havens and resources for youth in crisis. Safe Place creates a network of Safe Place locations &mdash; schools, fire stations, libraries, grocery and convenience stores, public transit, YMCAs and other appropriate public buildings &mdash; that display the yellow and black diamond-shaped Safe Place sign. These locations extend the doors of the youth service agency or emergency shelter throughout the community. Youth can easily access immediate help wherever they are.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Design by:<\/strong> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ampagency.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AMP Agency<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Ed.&#8217;s Notes:<\/strong> The original sign had been unfortunately pegged as inappropriate. (An adult grabbing a kid&#8217;s breasts for those with innocent minds). Number 3 on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.smosh.com\/smosh-pit\/photos\/accidentally-naughty-company-logos\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this list<\/a> of &#8220;20 Accidentally Naughty Company Logos&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Provided comment:<\/strong> &#8220;Businesses around the country can display the Safe Place sign in their window to tell kids that there is trained staff available to help them out when they have nowhere else to turn. Because there is so much recognition equity in the original sign, I had to work within that shape and those colors. And because their logo doubles as a window sign, and the word &#8216;national&#8217; in that scenario is irrelevant, they choose to not include the word in the logo, even though it is part of their name.&#8221; &mdash; Kevin Casey, Associate Creative Director, AMP Agency<\/p>\n<p><strong>Relevant links:<\/strong> <a href=\"http:\/\/nationalsafeplace.org\/media\/press-room\/national-safe-place-introduces-updated-logo\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press release<\/a>.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_121121_b_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_121121_b_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"574\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,79,25],"tags":[809,172,530],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2223"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2223"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2223\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2223"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2223"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2223"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
