Whisky runs through the city&#8217;s industrial heritage like the Clyde itself. Which is why our gleaming new Scotch Whisky Distillery at the Queen&#8217;s Dock has a touch of the inevitable about it. From here at the Pump House, the heart of Clydeside today, Customs &#038; Excise kept a watchful eye on exports of liquid gold. Turns out, our ancestor, John Morrison, built this very Dock in 1836 while he was busy building half the city. One whole generation before our family discovered whisky. John also had a hand in raising Loch Katrine, whose pure soft water goes into making Clydeside Single Malt Whisky today.&#8221;<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/clydeside_distillery_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for The Clydeside Distillery by Manual\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/clydeside_distillery_type_all.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for The Clydeside Distillery by Manual\" \/>\n<figcaption>Typography.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/clydeside_distillery_type.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for The Clydeside Distillery by Manual\" \/>\n<figcaption>Same as above but animated and bigger.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/clydeside_distillery_business_card.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for The Clydeside Distillery by Manual\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/clydeside_distillery_sign.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for The Clydeside Distillery by Manual\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sign.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/clydeside_distillery_signage_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for The Clydeside Distillery by Manual\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/clydeside_distillery_signage_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for The Clydeside Distillery by Manual\" \/>\n<figcaption>Signage.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/clydeside_distillery_exhibit_type_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for The Clydeside Distillery by Manual\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/clydeside_distillery_exhibit_type_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for The Clydeside Distillery by Manual\" \/>\n<figcaption>Interior graphics.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/clydeside_distillery_packaging_station_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for The Clydeside Distillery by Manual\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/clydeside_distillery_packaging_station_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for The Clydeside Distillery by Manual\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/clydeside_distillery_packaging_station_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for The Clydeside Distillery by Manual\" \/>\n<figcaption>Labeling station where visitors can choose a label style of their choice and fill it in the details.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/clydeside_distillery_packaging_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for The Clydeside Distillery by Manual\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/clydeside_distillery_packaging_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for The Clydeside Distillery by Manual\" \/>\n<figcaption>Packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/clydeside_distillery_barrels.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for The Clydeside Distillery by Manual\" \/>\n<figcaption>Goodness inside.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"(Est. 2017) &quot;The Clydeside Distillery is a single malt Scotch whisky distillery and visitor experience in the heart of Glasgow.
