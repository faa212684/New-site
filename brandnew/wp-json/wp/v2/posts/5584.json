Since then we&#8217;ve added media database and distribution services, comprehensive monitoring and social listening, content marketing solutions, media analysis, and government relations software to our product offerings. Over the years we&#8217;ve operated under different names such as Observer, Romeike, Bacon&#8217;s and Bowdens. In 2007, we rebranded as Cision. In 2014, we combined with Vocus and added Gorkana Group, Visible Technologies, PRWeb, Help a Reporter Out (HARO) and iContact to our family of brands. Today, with more than 100,000 customers and offices in nine countries, Cision is the leading provider of public relations and social software.&#8221;<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cision_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo for Cision (and PR Newswire)\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/lQTVVyyxWkA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Extra bland launch video.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cision_logo_before_after_prnewswire.png\" alt=\"New Logo for Cision (and PR Newswire)\" \/>\n<figcaption>PR Newswire logo, before and after.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"(Est. 2007) &quot;Cision started as the advertising department of Svenska Telegrambyr\u00e5n&#8211;a company providing press clipping services in Sweden&#8211;in 1892.
