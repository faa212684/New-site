The identity by Hamburg, Germany-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.make-studio.net\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Make Studio<\/a>, exudes the friendliness of someone whose names are Leni and Niki, through a minimalist set of graphics that reduces the bars to rectangles, the bites to circles, and the granola to dots and quarter rings, all in a smile-inducing combination of colors. If you visit <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/eatlenis\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">their Instagram page<\/a>, you can see the apostrophe-smile icon  that then becomes part of the wordmark, which, oddly enough, with the &#8220;i&#8221; looks like its shedding a tear. Still, the overall vibe of the packaging is so feel-good that I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s a tear of joy. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/48324819\/Lenis-Super-Good-Food?tracking_source=curated_galleries_list\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Hyperverse by Shuka Design<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_hyperverse.jpg\" alt=\"Hyperverse by Shuka Design\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/hyperverse.io\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hyperverse<\/a> specializes in virtual reality, creating the hardware and software that transports users into their own world, a hyperverse if you will. Designed by  Moscow-based <a href=\"https:\/\/shuka.design\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Shuka Design<\/a>, the logo is a playful take on the name and subject, showing a human falling into a black hole, which, in other contexts might be a sad concept but, here, we know they are being sucked into a black hole of awesomeness. It&#8217;s rare nowadays to see non-literal, illustration-based logos so this is a real pleasure; it&#8217;s like a logo from the good ol&#8217; days of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.michaelschwab.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Michael Schwab<\/a>. The wordmark is a funky, heavily extended custom design that channels <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=Roger+Excoffon&#038;lr=lang_en&#038;tbs=lr:lang_1en&#038;source=lnms&#038;tbm=isch&#038;sa=X&#038;ved=0ahUKEwjLwqev_O7SAhVC8IMKHbKaAlUQ_AUICCgB&#038;biw=1549&#038;bih=864\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Roger Excoffon<\/a>, which is always a win for me, and looks like it belongs in a space-age shuttle. In the end, I wouldn&#8217;t mind falling in such a good-looking rabbit hole. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/shuka.design\/hyperverse\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">IKEAtemporary by PJADAD<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_ikeatemporary.jpg\" alt=\"IKEAtemporary by PJADAD\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/IKEAtemporary\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">IKEAtemporary<\/a> was a pop-up shop in Milan back in 2015 that presented its Metod modular kitchen products arranged by a group of non-IKEA designers. The identity by Stockholm, Sweden-based <a href=\"http:\/\/pjadad.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PJADAD<\/a> played off the idea of a temporary space by using a caution-stripe motif of diagonal lines in the very non-IKEA color of green, which is what I think attracted me to this project to begin with. I also think I might be one of the few designers that REALLY likes IKEA&#8217;s custom Verdana font and I love seeing it displayed in large sizes and printed on wood. The raw-ish, unfinished nature of the pop-up space is a nice complement to the tightly controlled presentation of regular IKEAs. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/35125121\/IKEAtemporary\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Another week of minimalist-ish projects with work from Hamburg, Moscow, and Stockholm.
