Based on overlaid polygons that create trippy, Saul Bass-esque visuals, the event&#8217;s materials are energetic and diverse while the environmental graphics feel like a portal to a design dimension. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/28213919\/Visual-identity-of-Taiwan-designers-week-2015\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Creoquete by atipo<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_creoquete.jpg\" alt=\"Creoquete by atipo\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/creoquete.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> Creoquete <\/a> is a new shop in Gij&oacute;n, Spain, specializing in croquettes. This one might remind you of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_140.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Friday Likes 140&#8217;s ba.ro.co<\/a> as it&#8217;s also a three-dot, serif identity. Rest assured that I&#8217;m not trying to sound like a broken record, liking the same thing every Friday. (Although it does show consistency on my part). Aside from the minimal, elegant, and earthy design by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/atipo.es\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">atipo<\/a>, what I liked about this project was the play on words which I will try to explain as best as possible to our English readers. The shop&#8217;s name, Creoquete, sounds like croquette but it doubles as &#8220;Creo que te&hellip;&#8221; which translates to &#8220;I believe that you&hellip;&#8221; &mdash; where the dots in the logo serve as both ellipsis and abstract croquettes. The applications then go on to say things like &#8220;Creo que te&hellip; Encantan nuestras croquetas&#8221; (&#8220;I believe that you&hellip; Love our croquettes&#8221;) or &#8220;Creo que te&hellip; Estas enganchando&#8221; (&#8220;I believe that you&hellip; Are getting hooked&#8221;). It&#8217;s charming and playful and the serif-only approach gives it a poetry vibe that gets you right in the mood for croquettes. <a href=\"http:\/\/atipo.es\/en\/portfolio\/creoquete\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Park Distillery by Glasfurd &amp; Walker<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_parkbanff.jpg\" alt=\"Park Distillery by Glasfurd &amp; Walker\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.parkdistillery.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Park Distillery<\/a> is a restaurant and bar in Banff, Canada, providing &#8220;campfire-inspired cooking&#8221;, which sounds as awesome as the identity by Vancouver-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.glasfurdandwalker.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Glasfurd &amp; Walker<\/a> looks. The logo and identity uses two typefaces from <a href=\"http:\/\/lettersfromsweden.se\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Letters from Sweden<\/a>, Ferry and Kumla, that come across as a mix of industrial strength and vernacular signage, which may be tied back to the whole campfire thing. I&#8217;m not 100% convinced of the concept but the execution and aesthetic is great, with a perfect mix of colors and materials. And, once again, those enamel cups look far too cool. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.glasfurdandwalker.com\/project\/park-restaurant-distillery\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/strong> (<a href=\"http:\/\/bpando.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Via BP&amp;O<\/a>)<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"From trippy to minimal to rustic, we have something for whatever ails you this morning with work from Taipei, Gij&oacute;n, and Vancouver&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[540,729,564],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4293"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4293"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4293\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4293"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4293"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4293"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
