Other than some obligatory happy-people photographs everything just feels rather antiseptic. One of the options we were presented as a front-runner was for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hipusa.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">HIP Health Plan of New York<\/a> and its design did not instill enough confidence to plunk down more than a thousand dollars. Eventually we went with a provider that had a decent corporate identity <em>and<\/em> the best coverage. But enough of the set up. Recently the above mentioned provider, HIP, and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ghi.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Group Health Incorporated<\/a> (GHI) became affiliated under a new parent company, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.emblemhealth.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">EmblemHealth<\/a> and have begun a very visible campaign in New York to promote the company.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/emblemhalth_ad_detail.jpg\" alt=\"EmblemHealth Print Ad, Detail\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Detail of print ad. You can see the full ad and others at <a href=\"http:\/\/bestadsontv.com\/search_results.php?quick=emblemhealth&#038;st=1%2C2%2C3%2C5%2C6&#038;whichForm=quick\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bestadsontv.com<\/a> (free registration to see full scale).<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The advertising campaign has been developed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hhcc.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hill Holiday<\/a>, and it revolves around using the logo as a patch to create other hand-drawn, line-art shapes, which sometimes works and others it feel forced, but the effect in general is pleasant. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.siegelgale.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Siegel+Gale<\/a> developed the branding strategy and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.interbrand.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Interbrand<\/a> designed the logo. Considering all the different creative groups working on this, the result feels remarkably uncompromising. When you consider identity design for health insurance &mdash; with all its blue and aqua hues, and all its shield and cross imagery &mdash; this logo for EmblemHealth nicely breaks away from convention with a warm and playful color palette and a simple, abstract icon. What does the icon mean, though? I don&#8217;t think it really matters: It&#8217;s pretty, it&#8217;s authoritative, it looks confident and it&#8217;s memorable. I wonder if I had started my health insurance today if I would have given a second thought to HIP.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[72,12,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/709"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=709"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/709\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=709"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=709"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=709"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
