The museum&#8217;s permanent collection features over 1,200 pieces of his work and will feature local and international artists in its temporary exhibits along with a robust range of public programs.

The concrete reference is the windows and openings drawn on large-scale plans, gestures that were replicated in the typography by means of cuts and holes, alluding to the positive-negative space, interior-exterior, window, landscape.<br \/><br \/>The graphic system of the MMAC is based on typography and is also complemented with the design of iconography of signaling, color codes and dynamic and expressive information grids.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.sociedadanonima.mx\/Projects.php?Id=170\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sociedad An\u00f3nima project page (Google-translated)<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mmac_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for MMAC by Sociedad An\u00f3nima\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mmac_logo_with_name.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for MMAC by Sociedad An\u00f3nima\" \/>\n<figcaption>With full name.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>At first glance, without any explanation, the logo quickly gives off a contemporary arts museum vibe with a relatively uncomfortable logo. When seen in the context of the building, it&#8217;s easy to understand where the odd letter shapes come from, as the museum features large concrete walls and spaces with square and rectangular cuts that the letters emulate. The tiny window in the large facade being the most evident example. On its own, it&#8217;s a strange logo &#8212; which doesn&#8217;t make it bad, just an acquired taste &#8212; but when it&#8217;s supported by the matching visual identity, it&#8217;s a pretty convincing signature that captures the intended tension of the system and the space itself.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mmac_font_sans.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for MMAC by Sociedad An\u00f3nima\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mmac_font.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for MMAC by Sociedad An\u00f3nima\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mmac_font_display.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for MMAC by Sociedad An\u00f3nima\" \/>\n<figcaption>Custom type family.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mmac_font_specimen.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for MMAC by Sociedad An\u00f3nima\" \/>\n<figcaption>Type specimen.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>At the core of the identity is the custom sans serif family in two styles, normal and cuckoo&#8230; or, more technically, Text and Display. It&#8217;s interesting how the display version shouldn&#8217;t work but actually works great: The squared-off interiors are weird, the notches in letters like &#8220;E&#8221; and &#8220;F&#8221; are kind of dumb, and some letters just look odd (like the &#8220;1&#8221;) but all together and in use, it&#8217;s surprisingly effective, quite awesome, and very different from the current safe standards in identity design.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mmac_business_cards.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for MMAC by Sociedad An\u00f3nima\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mmac_folder.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for MMAC by Sociedad An\u00f3nima\" \/>\n<figcaption>Folder.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mmac_brochures.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for MMAC by Sociedad An\u00f3nima\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brochures.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mmac_website.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for MMAC by Sociedad An\u00f3nima\" \/>\n<figcaption>Website.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mmac_mugs.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for MMAC by Sociedad An\u00f3nima\" \/>\n<figcaption>Mugs.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mmac_not_sure.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for MMAC by Sociedad An\u00f3nima\" \/>\n<figcaption>Not sure.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The print applications look solid, with the large use of the logo paired with the text version of the type family and a little bit of flair from the display version.
