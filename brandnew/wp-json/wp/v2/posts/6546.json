The headquarters of the International Olympic Committee are here, as well as unique museums undergoing exciting transformations and a new aquarium contrasting with the city&#8217;s Gothic Old Town.&#8221; Earlier this year, the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lausanne.ch\/en\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">City of Lausanne<\/a> introduced a new identity designed by the Geneva, Switzerland, office of <a href=\"https:\/\/basedesign.com\/geneva\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Base<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>Our challenge was to reconcile the rich past of this storied city with the municipality&#8217;s need to modernize its identity and communication system.<br \/><br \/>The new identity is rooted in two essential elements that pay homage to Lausanne&#8217;s long-established traditions: the resurgence of the lion as a symbolic representation of the city. And a custom contemporary typeface, called &#8220;Lausanne,&#8221; serving as necessary reminder of its history.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/basedesign.com\/two-lions-and-a-red-stripe-for-lausanne\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Base project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lausanne_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for City of Lausanne by Base\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lausanne_icon_detail_a.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for City of Lausanne by Base\" \/>\n<figcaption>Single-color icon detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo &#8212; which it looks like it remains in use by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lausanne-tourisme.ch\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lausanne tourism<\/a> &#8212; was okay with its (what I&#8217;m guessing was a) rising sun spreading over a tracked out slab serif wordmark (both elements that feel very un-Swiss-like) but its length was problematic and as a logo to be used for city administration purposes, the sun may have been too relaxed. The new logo revives the lions from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ngw.nl\/heraldrywiki\/index.php?title=Lausanne\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lausanne&#8217;s heraldry past<\/a> and pairs them with the bare coat of arms shield shape. The lions are quite nicely done with a minimal yet ornate execution that works great with the simple shield and abstract crown. The new icon is paired with a custom font that builds on the sans serif Swissness that we all love the Swiss for with a custom take on the Humanist sans serif. The &#8220;a&#8221;s are super nice and the rest is all fine. In the stacked lock-up of the logo, the thicknes relationship between the icon and the type is quite pleasant.<\/p>\n<blockquote>We began by analyzing the city&#8217;s coat of arms, from which we drew a  font with unusual proportions. The typeface features lowercase letters that are \u2154 the size of the capital letters. The result is a simple, warm, and coherent visual language supported by a typeface with distinct character.<br \/><br \/>Since the 1950s, Switzerland has been typographically synonymous with simple, rational, and legible fonts&#8211;like Helvetica or Univers. These fonts have become the symbol of modernity and timelessness. Rather than piggybacking on the success of these particular fonts, we decided to combine the bold use of the color red with a contemporary return to the inherent Swiss-style to give the municipality of Lausanne an intrepid voice.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/basedesign.com\/two-lions-and-a-red-stripe-for-lausanne\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Base project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video controls controlsList=\"nodownload\" poster=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lausanne_typeconcept_lores.jpg\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lausanne_typeconcept_lores.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Custom typography structure.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lausanne_icon_type_relationship.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for City of Lausanne by Base\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icon-type height relationship.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lausanne_typography_01.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for City of Lausanne by Base\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lausanne_typography_00.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for City of Lausanne by Base\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lausanne_typography_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for City of Lausanne by Base\" \/>\n<figcaption>Custom font.
