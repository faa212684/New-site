Working for the consumer, healthcare, energy, and industrial markers, CDP designs products like a disposable splint system for fractured limbs, a respiratory humidifier, a self-cleaning powered painter, a device to help save water in the shower. CDP recently introduced a new identity designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.movingbrands.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Moving Brands<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>[The] existing business story &#8216;Think differently&#8217; &mdash; although genuine &mdash; was almost a replica of Apple&#8217;s &#8216;Think Different,&#8217; an irony that worked directly against communicating its truly innovative approach. We redefined the brand story as &#8216;Potential realised,&#8217; precisely encapsulating the company&#8217;s purpose and its ability, through innovation, to realise potential for its clients.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.movingbrands.com\/work\/cdp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Moving Brands case study<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/97829205?title=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=84eaea\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>CDP folks explain their business and how the new identity works for them.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>We retained the name Cambridge Design Partnership as it anchored the business to positive perceptions, but we knew its length would present challenges across applications. We created a symbol to work alongside the wordmark, which in time could be used exclusively to represent the business in all markets.<br \/><br \/>This symbol and accompanying visual identity system flowed from tensions inherent in the business: between design + science, curiosity + focus, technical + human. A combination of straight and curved components form an ownable mark that feels both engineered yet human.<br \/><br \/>Graphic textures are created by rotating and cropping this symbol, to create a range of expressions, from measured and precise to vibrant and expressive.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.movingbrands.com\/work\/cdp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Moving Brands case study<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cambridge_design_partnership_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Cambridge Design Partnership by Moving Brands\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cambridge_design_partnership_logo_explanation.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Cambridge Design Partnership by Moving Brands\" \/>\n<figcaption>Rationale.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cambridge_design_partnership_logo_sheets.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Cambridge Design Partnership by Moving Brands\" \/>\n<figcaption>Print test sheets.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cambridge_design_partnership_guidelines.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Cambridge Design Partnership by Moving Brands\" \/>\n<figcaption>Guideline pages.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo wasn&#8217;t too terrible, it was just really long and wordy and not particularly indicative of a company designing highly efficient and advanced products. The hand-drawn line did help give it a human touch but other than that, a fairly forgettable logo. The new logo is still long and wordy &mdash; and I&#8217;m glad that both client and Moving Brands didn&#8217;t change the name to something like Cinammon or some other Palo Alto-ish clever name &mdash; but the choice of Grilli Type&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.grillitype.com\/typefaces\/gt-pressura\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pressura Mono<\/a> set in all uppercase helps give the long name order and simplicity. The new icon &mdash; a &#8220;c&#8221;, &#8220;d&#8221;, &#8220;p&#8221; monogram &mdash; is an attractive solution that conveys a contemporary, technological feel more in tune with the products they create. Highlighting the joints of the shapes where the lines intersect with a color overlay isn&#8217;t a novel idea but what&#8217;s particularly nice here is that you get a teardrop shape, a circle, and a square, taking this trend one step forward.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cambridge_design_partnership_logo_stationery.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Cambridge Design Partnership by Moving Brands\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stationery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cambridge_design_partnership_logo_concept_doc.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Cambridge Design Partnership by Moving Brands\" \/>\n<figcaption>Concept document.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cambridge_design_partnership_logo_3D.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Cambridge Design Partnership by Moving Brands\" \/>\n<figcaption>3D-printed version of the logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cambridge_design_partnership_office.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Cambridge Design Partnership by Moving Brands\" \/>\n<figcaption>New offices with design applied.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">In application, the logo is blown-up and rotated to highlight the joints, providing slightly abstract patterns and crops while everything else is spare and minimal. There isn&#8217;t much else to see but you can definitely appreciate the commitment to a clean and efficient identity system.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1996, Cambridge Design Partnership (CDP) is a technology and industrial product development consultancy with 65 employees in two offices &mdash; its headquarters in Cambridge, England, and a new one in Palo Alto, CA.
