If you&#8217;ve ever called your bank&#8217;s customer support or tried to decode the online statements and wished that instead you were sitting naked in an igloo then you know what I&#8217;m talking about. Simple is not a bank, they are an intermediary between you and a bank. As they put it, &#8220;We take care of you, our bank partners take care of your money.&#8221; They provide a Visa card and you can then track your account and expenses through an amazingly designed and intuitive online and mobile interface. After being in Beta for a few months, Simple has launched to the public with a new name and new identity designed in-house by <a href=\"http:\/\/iancollins.me\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ian Collins<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>Today is a new beginning for another reason as well: BankSimple is now Simple. Simple is a better representation of what we aspire to. It releases us from the constraints of an industry in desperate need of innovation.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.simple.com\/blog\/Simple\/introducing-simple\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Introducing Simple<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/simple_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"Simple\" \/><\/p>\n<blockquote>The Simple icon is a basic guilloche pattern meant to resemble a torus or ring. A guilloche is a complex pattern created from simple, repeated, geometric steps defined by elementary equations. It&#8217;s this easily generated, difficult to reproduce intricacy that has led to a guilloche appearing in some form on most of the world&#8217;s currency. It is a sign of authenticity and security. That their intricate beauty is derived from understandable, algorithmic methods is what drew us to guilloche patterns and ultimately led us to represent our company and mission with one.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.simple.com\/blog\/Simple\/simple-branding\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Simple Branding<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/simple_branding-post-sizes.png\" alt=\"Simple\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Icon for use at different sizes.<\/p>\n<p>The previous logo looked like a cheap online company that I would have a hard time trusting with my money. As far as twenty-first-century start-up logos go, it wasn&#8217;t that bad but, by contrast, what a difference a nice logo makes. The new logo makes Simple look like an established financial entity, there is a big sense of confidence in that logo. The icon seems almost too easy but, by evoking the patterns we see in currency every day, it makes a lot of sense. I applaud the creation of separate icons for different sizes so that when used small it doesn&#8217;t look like an aerial shot of Zuccotti Park pre-evacuation. The typography, well, it&#8217;s Gotham. Again. Seems like it&#8217;s on a rampage this fourth quarter. As usual, it works well. Overall, this is a great aesthetic for a start-up company asking people to give up their banks that, even if hated, is the trusted form of money management.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/simple_card.jpg\" alt=\"Simple\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">The Simple Visa card.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_111116_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_111116_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_111116_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_111116_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,37,26],"tags":[441,314,596],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1723"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1723"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1723\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1723"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1723"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1723"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
