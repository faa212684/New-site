If none of that sentence makes sense to you as it didn&#8217;t do for me, here is another try: Voxbone provides companies with access to actual phone numbers in 60 countries so that those companies can set up global phone systems without dealing with each country&#8217;s processes while also providing the backbone for those companies to set up call centers, conferencing systems, and more. Or something like that. Based in Brussels, Voxbone has offices in San Francisco, Austin, Los Angeles, London, Iasi and Seoul, and counts with clients like Skype, FoodPanda, and Deutsche Telekom. Recently, Voxbone introduced a new identity designed by London, UK-based <a href=\"http:\/\/onwards.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Onwards<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>In the stuffy telco industry, Voxbone have always been a disruptor. So we built a positioning born from their outlier spirit; Voxbone don&#8217;t just make the insanely complex world of global communications simple, they make it &#8216;Strangely Simple&#8217;.<br \/><br \/>This unusual positioning became the guide for all brand creative. We developed a playful identity and tone for the brand that would bring out their rebellious spirit and amplify their eccentric personality.<br \/><br \/>Their new logo is designed to standout instantly in a digital world. The mouth shape comes from the V and B in Voxbone as well as representing voice (Voxbone&#8217;s core product) and is designed to be used flexibly within the brand language &#8211; as a pattern, texture, pinpoint, super graphic, or as part of the illustrative language.<\/blockquote><h3>Onwards provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/voxbone_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Voxbone by Onwards\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video controls autoplay loop><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/voxbone_logo_animation_lo.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo animation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/voxbone_logo_variations.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Voxbone by Onwards\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo variations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo was pretty much fine and could have easily lasted for the rest of time without anyone complaining. The new one, though, shows what a big difference it makes to infuse a little bit of personality into a logo. Using its &#8220;V&#8221; and &#8220;B&#8221; initials, the logo features and icon\/monogram in the shape of a mouth which, on paper, sounds like a terrible idea but, in execution, it yields a charismatic, slightly bratty icon that works wonders to loosen up the identity in an otherwise bland industry. The new wordmark is fine as well and mostly it provides a kind of sane segue from the old logo to transition into the more <em>vocal<\/em> new identity. The update to the purple hue is a huge improvement, since the old one was so drab.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/voxbone_brand_platform.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Voxbone by Onwards\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brand platform.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video controls autoplay loop><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/voxbone_strangeometer_lo.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Simplicity vs. Strangeness ratio.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Part of what makes this identity work so well is how clear the positioning is: Strangely simple. It sets everything up neatly and the identity sticks to it by not getting overly complicated and keeping things just the right amount of weird.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/voxbone_old_identity.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Voxbone by Onwards\" \/>\n<figcaption>Samples of the old identity.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old identity was sooooo purple and it clearly lacked cohesion. The new identity introduces a lot of flexibility through a wider and brighter color palette as well as a simplified range of typographic choices (basically, just the one sans serif).<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/voxbone_business_cards_a.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Voxbone by Onwards\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/voxbone_brochure.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Voxbone by Onwards\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/voxbone_brochure_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Voxbone by Onwards\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brochure.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The illustrations are pretty cool and they are used nicely throughout Voxbone&#8217;s website.
