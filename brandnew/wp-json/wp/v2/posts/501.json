Whether it&#8217;s from Subway, Quizno&#8217;s, Jimmy John&#8217;s (probably some of the best), or the unnamed deli down the corner I appreciate the art of a good, balanced sandwich. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.togos.com\/\">Togo&#8217;s<\/a> however, was never on my lunch considerations. One, because it was always next to a Dunkin&#8217; Donuts and\/or Baskin Robbins &mdash; making perfect sense since they are all part of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dunkinbrands.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dunkin&#8217; Brands<\/a> food chain &mdash; second, because I could never figure out how to pronounce the name (silly excuse, I know), and third, the logo always seemed like a cheap, fast foodish hole desperately trying to look healthy, in that <a href=\"http:\/\/images.google.com\/images?en&#038;q=whole+foods+logo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Whole Foods logo kind of way<\/a>. One day, in Chicago, with little time for lunch and a Togo&#8217;s on the opposite corner from my previous office it was the only choice. Boy, was I surprised: They make a good sandwich. Good amount of turkey, cheese, greens and just enough Mayo oozing from the sides. Clearly I wasn&#8217;t aware of their founding principles, &#8220;freshly prepared, generously portioned, made to order sandwiches.&#8221; Nor did I know that Togo&#8217;s was a California-bred sandwich shop &mdash; with their previous logo, my best bet would have been New Jersey-bred, no offense. With their new logo, Togo&#8217;s is claiming its sea-side origins and laid back attitude by embracing a surfing dude, ripping some waves on what I would think is a surfboard\/salami sub and a quirkily-set wordmark. All of which I, well, hate. But at least I know what Togo&#8217;s is about now and what to expect. And that can&#8217;t be <em>that<\/em> bad. Like their sandwiches.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Thanks to Daniel Khamsing for the tip.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,69,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/501"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=501"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/501\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=501"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=501"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=501"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
