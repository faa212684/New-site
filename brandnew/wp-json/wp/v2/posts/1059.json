Yesterday, Lord Mandelson, the UK&#8217;s Business Secretary, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/bisgovuk#p\/u\/6\/7GIaO-jBWvI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">announced the creation of the UK Space Agency<\/a>, &#8220;Exactly,&#8221; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bnsc.gov.uk\/News-and-Events\/News\/17628.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">he said<\/a>, &#8220;the kind of high value-added industry we need to support as we rebalance our economy, creating sustainable growth and the jobs of the future.&#8221; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bis.gov.uk\/News\/Speeches\/uk-space-agency-launch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Complementing that sentiment<\/a> was Lord Drayson, Minister for Science and Innovation, &#8220;We&#8217;re acting now, because this is a critical moment in the economic cycle &mdash; a point where existing markets are set to grow and new markets set to emerge. This is the time to go for growth.&#8221; The new agency <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bnsc.gov.uk\/News-and-Events\/News\/17628.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">will replace the 24-year-old British National Space Centre<\/a> as the go-to body for all things space related. For such a high stakes, important venture, it sure has a funny logo.<\/p><!--more--><p>Created by Oxfordshire-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.foliocreative.co.uk\/folio\/news.php?post=14\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Folio Creative<\/a>, the new logo has all the accoutrements of a United Kingdom logo: Gill Sans, diagonal lines a la flag, and the RWB color palette. In my first impression I also noticed another local inspiration, perhaps far-fetched, the visual language (<a href=\"http:\/\/images.google.com\/images?q=sex%20pistols%20covers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">or at least at the visual attitude<\/a>) of the Sex Pistols covers. While not as aggressive or authentic, of course, the UK Space Agency logo does have a welcome energy to it that most government logos lack. Except that, unfortunately, that energy is a little misguided. The logo feels too playful and ironic&hellip; I mean, do we <em>really<\/em> need an arrow pointing to where space is? The awkwardness of the logo is even more enhanced by the clunky arrangement and sizing of the typography.<\/p>\n<p>The UK Space Agency is set to launch on April 1, 2010 so maybe the joke will be on us, and not the logo.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/samrobertsdesign.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sam Roberts<\/a> for first tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_100324_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_100324_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"574\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[70,12,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1059"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1059"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1059\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1059"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1059"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1059"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
