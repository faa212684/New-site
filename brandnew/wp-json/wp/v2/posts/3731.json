The Red Pencil works in hospitals, clinics, and conflict zones as needed. Despite the blue helmet and peace-wreath graphic, The Red Pencil is not associated with the United Nations &mdash; something I immediately assumed was the case. Over the next months, the organization will be implementing a new identity designed by New York, NY-based <a href=\"http:\/\/fleve.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fl&euml;ve Partners<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>We decided to continue using the current symbol since it&#8217;s been around for a long time and has acquired a certain level of credibility within the target audience. We left the character as the main graphic symbol, but made it more interactive and suitable for the current times. It&#8217;s become more than just a static symbol; now it&#8217;s a communication platform with lots of future applications that helps develop a stronger connection with donors, volunteers and other stakeholders much more quickly with a much longer lasting effect. [&hellip;] It is also important for the new character to not strongly convey war-related connotations, thus opening the door to a wider audience and sub-branding.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/22213489\/The-Red-Pencil-International-Singapore\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fl&euml;ve Partners project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_red_pencil_logo_variations.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for The Red Pencil by Fl&euml;ve Partners\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo variations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_red_pencil_logo_neon.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for The Red Pencil by Fl&euml;ve Partners\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo with neon.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Clearly the old logo lacked finesse and proper construction\/rendering to function as a logo. I also wonder if the U.N. expressed some concern to them that the blue helmet generated confusion and asked The Red Pencil to avoid using it. Regardless, the evolution is pretty great. The new character is simple, playful, and has a winning smile. Bringing in the blue as patterns and drawings on the helmet is creative, ingenious, and has great potential for expanding the messages of the little person. The oversize pencil is chunky and nicely done, although the heart shape found in the old pencil (whether intentional or not) was a cute element.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_red_pencil_cards_pencils.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for The Red Pencil by Fl&euml;ve Partners\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards and pencils.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_red_pencil_tshirt.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for The Red Pencil by Fl&euml;ve Partners\" \/>\n<figcaption>T-shirt.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">Not much to see in application, possibly because there isn&#8217;t a big budget to produce loads of things. The brief glimpse at the typography and layouts leave room for improvement and exploration, as it&#8217;s not the most exciting. Nonetheless, the little kid saves the day, no matter what.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 2013 (I believe), The Red Pencil is a nonprofit organization based in Singapore that provides art therapy to children who have fallen victim to long-term hospitalization, trauma, disabilities, natural disasters, or civil conflicts.
