From its stunning little building that looks like a tiny castle to its identity, designed by Moscow, Russia-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nineteen.design\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Nineteen<\/a>, there is a fun surrealism to it. A series of charming illustrations of jays and heavy foliage manage to capture the intent of the designers that is a &#8220;playful and juicy visual language that has a strong colonial times general asian flavour with a little Singapore accent&#8221; &#8212; I would have never been able to put my finger on it but after reading their description it&#8217;s, like, yes, it&#8217;s exactly that. The detailed illustration style, textured typography, and general lack of white space add up to a rich, ornate, and unique design. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nineteen.design\/work\/jay\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Andy Wolf by von K<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_andywolf.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Wolf by von K\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.andy-wolf.com\/en\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Andy Wolf<\/a> is an eyewear company based in Hartberg, Austria, that designs, manufactures, and distributes a classy evolving selection of glasses. (Disclaimer: This identity is a bit old, 2016, but still looks fresh.) The italic logo, which existed before but <a href=\"https:\/\/d353r0i7qv3gvw.cloudfront.net\/92\/2397592\/stage-mobile\/6993839.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">in a different font and with a period<\/a>, was updated by Graz, Austria-based <a href=\"http:\/\/von-k.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">von K<\/a>, with a crisper font and changed the period to a comma, adding a bit of whimsy to it, looking like an unfinished, open thought. The applications have a minimalist aesthetic that make the logo with the comma stand out even more. A few instances, like the business cards and tote, have some more relatively intricate type layouts that add some visual texture to the applications. The &#8220;&hearts; YOU&#8221; detail goes a long way too. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/von-k.com\/projekt\/andy-wolf-identity\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">\u00c5hl\u00e9ns by Happy FB<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_ahlens.jpg\" alt=\"\u00c5hl\u00e9ns by Happy FB\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ahlens.se\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\u00c5hl\u00e9ns<\/a> is a large retailer in Sweden, with more than 50 department stores across the country and a history that dates back to 1899. A recent update by Stockholm, Sweden-based <a href=\"https:\/\/happy.fb.se\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Happy FB<\/a>, takes the well-known logo and disassembles it in a playful jumble that can be rearranged to fit in different-shaped areas. The color palette of maroon, red, and pink is sophisticated but also feels a little rebellious somehow. I can&#8217;t imagine any American department store looking like this so it&#8217;s quite the more enjoyable knowing that this can happen in other parts of the world. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/happy.fb.se\/project\/ahlens\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"No recurring theme or connecting thread this week, with projects from Moscow, Graz, and Stockholm&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,85,86,26],"tags":[1372,567,564,265,224],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7415"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=7415"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7415\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=7415"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=7415"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=7415"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
