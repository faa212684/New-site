We created a brand language that expresses itself as a harmonious balance between the vibrant muddle of the writing process and the sharp precision of a finely crafted piece. The tone of the imagery is introspective, thoughtful and intimate &mdash; evoking the perfect environment for creative writing.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/hyperakt.com\/items\/gotham-writers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hyperakt project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/gotham_writers_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Gotham Writers by Hyperakt\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/gotham_writers_icon_detail_with_workshop.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Gotham Writers by Hyperakt\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail. On blue and on light background with &#8220;Workshop&#8221; watermark.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>Gotham Writers&#8217; new mark says more with less. The interlocking &#8220;G&#8221; and &#8220;W&#8221; reveal the tip of a pencil, suggesting the craft and meditation at the heart of good writing. The emblem projects the confidence and maturity of an institution that has been honing its craft for 20 years. The geometric purity of the forms are an homage to the art deco heritage of the city we call Gotham &mdash; New York City.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/hyperakt.com\/items\/gotham-writers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hyperakt project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/gotham_writers_icon_detail_animation.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Gotham Writers by Hyperakt\" \/>\n<figcaption>Monogram build.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/gotham_writers_icon_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Gotham Writers by Hyperakt\" \/>\n<figcaption>Monogram detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The previous logo was brutally bad with the loosely-tracked, centered, condensed serif crowned by an extended GWW in an ellipse &mdash; not really the stuff that writing careers are built upon. The new logo, by contrast, has the look and feel of a storied guild, with its interlocking monogram and subtle secret: a pencil tip in the intersection of the &#8220;G&#8221; and &#8220;W&#8221;. I have to admit that it took me a couple of minutes to understand why the middle of the &#8220;W&#8221; was filled in but once I did it was the dorkiest thrill I&#8217;ve had all week. (I do realize it&#8217;s <em>only<\/em> Tuesday). A pencil may not be what first comes to mind when thinking of writers or the process of writing anything longer than a postcard but it&#8217;s still the quickest way of jotting down thoughts as they come along. The monogram is simple and elegant, pairing nicely with House Industries&#8217; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.houseind.com\/fonts\/neutraface\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Neutraface<\/a>. The new logo succeeds both in shortening the name and introducing a more simple identifier in the monogram.<\/p>\n<blockquote>Against the precision of the monogram we contrast the inherent vibrancy of the creative process with myriad handwriting styles that reflect the unique voice of each writer. The brand includes highlighter marks to illuminate key ideas, alluding to the process of editing and iterating involved in perfecting a well-crafted piece of writing.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/hyperakt.com\/items\/gotham-writers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hyperakt project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/gotham_writers_handwritten.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Gotham Writers by Hyperakt\" \/>\n<figcaption>Handwritten elements.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/gotham_writers_business_card.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Gotham Writers by Hyperakt\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/gotham_writers_notepads.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Gotham Writers by Hyperakt\" \/>\n<figcaption>Notepads.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>Gotham Writers is best known around New York for the bright yellow boxes that stand on street corners all over town and contain the school&#8217;s quarterly course catalog.
