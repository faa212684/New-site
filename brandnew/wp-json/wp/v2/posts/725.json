It&#8217;s not a redesign, it&#8217;s not about a logo, and it&#8217;s not quite about packaging, at least not mass consumer packaging. But it is about branding at a relatively micro level, which may speak more directly to the kinds of clients the majority of us work on from day to day. So, this is a peek at the work that UK-based designer and illustrator <a href=\"http:\/\/www.waldopancake.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jim Smith<\/a> has created over the past decade for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.puccinos.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Puccino&#8217;s<\/a>, a coffee retailer with franchise locations around the UK that has differentiated itself through humor and an off-beat attitude. And it has been the cups, in-store graphics and myriad little packages that have fully given Puccino&#8217;s its unique brand through a consistent style, approach and tone of voice. Following is a brief interview with Jim who has just designed six, brand new cups.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/puccinos_01.jpg\" alt=\"Puccino's\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/puccinos_02.jpg\" alt=\"Puccino's\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/puccinos_03.jpg\" alt=\"Puccino's\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Six new cup designs.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"red\"><strong>Armin Vit:<\/strong> When did you start working on Puccino&#8217;s and how did you get the project?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>JS:<\/strong> In 1998. I&#8217;d left college and had made a lifesize wooden Santa cutout for a lighting shop. He stood out the front looking menacing. The owner of Puccino&#8217;s saw it and asked me to do something similar for one of their shops. They had six then I think. Their marketing guy saw it and brought me in on a three month contract which has lasted ten years.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/puccinos_07.jpg\" alt=\"Puccino's\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"red\"><strong>Jim Smith:<\/strong> What was the direction you got to start your designs?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>JS:<\/strong> Everybody was busy growing the business so I was pretty much left to my own devices. They&#8217;d already bought into my style which at that point was a Ralph Steadman inspired scratchy pen and ink approach. I sat in a room above one of their stores and did loads of big drawings about coffee. They became posters for the shop walls and went on menus etc.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"red\"><strong>AV:<\/strong> How did you end up with this particular style?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>JS:<\/strong> By constantly working and sucking things up. I draw in my sketchbook everyday and look around and get jealous. You slowly see a style appearing that is a pretty good reflection of yourself and the things you like. I&#8217;m pleased that I&#8217;ve been able to combine my love of drawing and packaging.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/puccinos_05.jpg\" alt=\"Puccino's\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>White sugar packets.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"red\"><strong>AV:<\/strong> Do you do all the copywriting yourself?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>JS:<\/strong> Yes. It started out as a way to validate my drawings with a few words underneath and has ended up the other way round.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"red\"><strong>AV:<\/strong> How often does Puccino&#8217;s introduce new designs?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>JS:<\/strong> A new set of cups comes out about once a year. I push for it to be more often. I&#8217;d like to get to a point where we only do one print run per design.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/puccinos_08.jpg\" alt=\"Puccino's\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"red\"><strong>AV:<\/strong> What have been some of your favorite designs\/writings that have not been produced?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>JS:<\/strong> I wanted to have &#8220;suspicious package&#8221; on the side of our paper bags but that was vetoed. And my hanging man tea tag was banned after complaints. I used to like referencing tramps and coffee breath a lot and that stuff never got through. Apart from that most of what I do is accepted.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/puccinos_06.jpg\" alt=\"Puccino's\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>For more Puccino&#8217;s designs, check out Jim&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/waldopancake\/sets\/72157594409406379\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Flickr set of the ongoing work<\/a>.<\/strong><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[12,86,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/725"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=725"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/725\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=725"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=725"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=725"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
