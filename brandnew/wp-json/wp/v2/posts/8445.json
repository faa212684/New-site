Made from natural ingredients, all boldly and transparently listed on each product page, MUTHA was conceived by model, entrepreneur, philanthropist, and, yes, mother, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/hope-smith-b60274192\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hope Smith<\/a>. At $95 and $104 each of the products, it&#8217;s not a cheap impulse buy and it&#8217;s nice to know that 5% of sales are donated to humanitarian nonprofit organization, <a href=\"https:\/\/internationalmedicalcorps.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">International Medical Corps<\/a>. The identity and packaging for MUTHA have been designed by San Francisco, CA- and New York, NY-based <a href=\"https:\/\/character.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Character<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>Our job: take one mother&#8217;s mission and turn it into a MUTHA f*ing rallying cry&#8211; a brand that would embody Hope&#8217;s ambition and carve out an unforgettable place in our crowded bathroom vanities.<br \/><br\/>So we looked at motherhood for what it is&#8211;an ever-evolving cycle. Something for the brave, the powerful. Unique, different, personal. These often ignored truths led us to a singular conclusion, one that oriented all our work&#8211;there&#8217;s no one way to MUTHA.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/character.co\/work\/mutha\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Character project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mutha_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for MUTHA by Character\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>From the outset, both the name and the logo set up a tough, no-shit-taken, no-fucks-given attitude that is unexpected in the category. I will leave it up to mothers to share with us if this vibe speaks to them at all. From the perspective of a male, father of two, and reviewer of brands, I like the approach simply because it breaks the soft and silky conventions of body oils that (stereo)typically look and sound <em>feminine<\/em>. It&#8217;s impossible to read this name and not also think about that second word that&#8217;s usually associated with snakes on planes, so I appreciate the boldness and willingness to go there, especially in an era when it&#8217;s so mutha-effin&#8217; easy to offend people.<\/p>\n<p>The bold, extended, all uppercase, sans serif wordmark &#8212; typeset in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.myfonts.com\/fonts\/ogj-typedesign\/sequel-100-wide\/?refby=ucllc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sequel 100 Wide<\/a> &#8212; captures the essence of the name quite well and bluntly presents it with no additional decoration or attempts at being clever. The flip side is that, yeah, it&#8217;s just another dry sans serif that pretends to be cool, so I&#8217;m with you too on anyone that is on this side of the argument.<\/p>\n<blockquote>There&#8217;s an innate strength and bravery that radiates from every MUTHA. To reveal and celebrate this self-sufficient power, we scoured the world for things both bold and organic and found natural armor, one that displays the inner force of each MUTHA with vibrance and pride.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/character.co\/work\/mutha\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Character project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mutha_beetle.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for MUTHA by Character\" \/>\n<figcaption>Beetle.

The logo, used small on the bottom of the two containers, gives it a luxury feel you wouldn&#8217;t expect from a product call MUTHA. The outer boxes are a lot louder and a nice contrast to the product, photographing extremely well together.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mutha_messaging.gif\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for MUTHA by Character\" \/>\n<figcaption>Messaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mutha_guidelines.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for MUTHA by Character\" \/>\n<figcaption>Guidelines.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mutha_photography.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for MUTHA by Character\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brand photography.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mutha_cards.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for MUTHA by Character\" \/>\n<figcaption>Cards of some sort.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mutha_wildpostings.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for MUTHA by Character\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mutha_wildpostings_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for MUTHA by Character\" \/>\n<figcaption>Wild postings.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>In application, things get a little on the trendy side with the repetition of words and abrupt crops but does manage to come across as bold and confident. The brand photography is pretty great too &#8212; I wish it played a bigger role on their website and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/mutha\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Instagram page<\/a> (instead of the few, more model-y photos there).<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mutha_tape.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for MUTHA by Character\" \/>\n<figcaption>Tape.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">Overall, the identity and tone of voice nail the <em>mutha<\/em> attitude, perhaps a little too well to the point where it might be a turn-off for some people but, in the end, I guess that&#8217;s the goal, to create a unique product and brand that appeals to a like-minded group and this establishes clear parameters who it&#8217;s for&#8230; perhaps, even, your own <strike>mom<\/strike> mutha.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Launched in September of 2019, MUTHA is a new brand of body butters and body oils created with mothers in mind and the resulting stretch marks after a pregnancy (or from weight loss).
