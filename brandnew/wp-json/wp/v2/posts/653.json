And if you&#8217;re from the 1990s, Tasti is the rumored unaccredited culprit on the &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/fullpage.html?res=9F04E6DB1338F931A35753C1A9649C8B63&#038;sec=health&#038;spon=&#038;partner=permalink&#038;exprod=permalink\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Yogurt<\/a>&#8221; episode of <em>Seinfeld<\/em>. To the uninitiated, this dairy based treat is &#8220;Not frozen yogurt, because it doesn&#8217;t contain yogurt. Not ice cream, because it contains less fat,&#8221; according to Tasti <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tastidlite.com\/index.php\/talk-to-us\/faqs.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">faqs<\/a>. So let&#8217;s just call it <em>substance<\/em>.<\/p><!--more--><p>Over the winter when normal people weren&#8217;t craving frozen desserts, or blogging about them, Tasti D-Lite launched a new website and identity program. This came on the cusp of its acquisition by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.steelpointcp.com\/news.php?article=67\">SPG Partners<\/a>, declaring that they will &#8220;facilitate the growth of the brand to markets both domestic and international.&#8221; Subsequently, existing stores are falling into rank and converting to a franchise model which will presumably allow for tight implementation of the new brand.<\/p>\n<p>That said, the new logo is tempting &mdash; sort of like peeping at a dessert through a key-hole. Forms, and elements from the previous identity are reassuringly present; including the sweet pink and rich blue. The dollop holds its own without a thick badge, and the expression is now less Droste Effect without the fancy glass bowl. Avenir is refreshingly light as a support to brand the otherwise slick and generic symbol. The lockup is proportionally top-heavy with the huge dollop of product floating over the loose type. <\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"before_after_tasti.jpg\" src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/before_after_tasti.jpg\" width=\"470\" height=\"200\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Perhaps taking its cues from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pinkberry.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pinkberry<\/a> or other premium retailers of frozen substance, the size is restrained on cups, and applied daintily. As contradiction of terms itself, the product demands that the brand be equally flexibile. While low-fat can only be said of the cold, creamy substance, one is always prompted to top their Fluffernutter&trade; with Butterfinger&trade; or any other number of high fat candies and whatnots. <\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"tag_.jpg\" src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/tag_.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"100\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The duplicitous tagline, &#8220;dessert your guilt&#8221; is a fitting oxymoron for a product which is promoted as light+delicious+healthy+sinful. If Tasti can speak to multiple audiences&#8217; cravings for health and indulgence with diplomacy, their magic recipe for frozen dessert product will spread across all continents at the fastest rate that venture capital will allow.<\/p>\n<p>When the new logo first hit the street on cups and napkins, I asked the Tasteologist at my local Tasti what he thought of the new logo, and if he could speculate whether this new look might impact business. He furrowed his brow and said, &#8220;If it&#8217;s hot, people come in. That&#8217;s all I know.&#8221;   <\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"tasti.coupon_1.jpg\" src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/tasti.coupon_1.jpg\" width=\"470\" height=\"200\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Thanks in advance if anyone from corporate headquarters wants to send me more coupons &mdash; they will be put to use.
