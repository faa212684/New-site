The company mainly focuses on protective head gear for baseball, softball, hockey, lacrosse and cycling. Under the Easton-Bell Sports name they manufacture and sell the popular Giro helmets and cycling accessories, the Riddell football helmets and hats, and the Bell motorcycling products. They also have their own branded products under the name Easton for lacrosse, hockey, baseball, and softball &mdash; in the past several months, Easton-Bell Sports has rolled out a newly updated mark that extends into these line of products.<\/p><!--more--><p>The new mark does what I believe some sports logos fail to do: create excitement. For example, the Big Ten logo (reviewed <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ten_is_the_new_twelve.php\">here<\/a> was incredibly smart, witty and did what it needed to do and more. However, the mark elicits little emotion for such an exhilarating sports athletic division. As for Easton, the strong, angular mark does create emotion. It evokes a high dose of power, strength, and determination that comes with playing any sport and can be easily understood by a kid playing tee ball and still not insult or bore a college graduate playing NCAA.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/easton_new_logo.gif\" alt=\"Easton\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The sharp and refined shapes of the mark describe the detail and precision of the products as the upward motion to the right enlightens you of the positive effect of the Easton products. The mark does a good job of replicating the &#8220;quick as lighting&#8221; movement of the three sports the brand represents: the swinging of a bat, a hockey stick, or a lacrosse stick.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/easton_new_type.gif\" alt=\"Easton\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The type is okay. A few sharp interior spaces to complement the mark and voila. I am a fan of the application across the products. They feel very powerful with the striking contrast of the yellow, black, and white, creating a strong brand presence and association. Not to mention it looks flat out mean as hell &mdash; which, to me, is a good thing.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/easton_baseball.gif\" alt=\"Easton\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Old baseball branding.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/easton_new_baseball.gif\" alt=\"Easton\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">New baseball branding.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/easton_hockey.gif\" alt=\"Easton\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Old hockey branding.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/easton_new_hockey_1.gif\" alt=\"Easton\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/easton_new_hockey_2.gif\" alt=\"Easton\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">New hockey branding.<\/p>\n<p>The overall mark will not break down walls or start revolutions as Nike as but this is a mark that can stand alone and excite me to swing to the fences at the batting cages.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to Oscar Morris for the tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_111011_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_111011_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_111011_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_111011_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_111011_config_03.xml&#038;xyz=poll_111011_votes_03.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv3\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv3\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":12,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,51,26],"tags":[153,42,121,530],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1671"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/12"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1671"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1671\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1671"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1671"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1671"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
