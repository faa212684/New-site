Operating through a franchising-only model, Minute Burger&#8217;s mission is to provide affordable and quality food for its customers and in the process has established a strong social media presence and following &#8212; on Facebook to be specific &#8212; making it a popular and well-known brand in its country. Earlier this year, Minute Burger began rolling out a new identity designed by Manila, Philippines-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bluethumbcreatives.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bluethumb<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>While the brand was known for providing value in its products and have a steady social media presence with high engagements from their Millennial target market, this resonance was not carried over in the store experience. In order to establish this relevance and edge they have over competitors, we concluded that consistency was needed to be implemented both online and offline in order for the brand to truly make its mark.<br \/><br \/>We worked together with the founder and the heads of Minute Burger in order to have a definitive idea that can solidify their identity. We built a brand strategy which positioned Minute Burger as a fun and adventurous brand with a clear purpose centered on creating everyday happiness through quality and affordable food that people can share with their loved ones. This became our basis in developing a distinct and stronger brand identity that was applied to the store experience, packaging, and motion graphics. Detailed brand guidelines were also written to align everyone involved in the implementation of the rebrand.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bluethumbcreatives.com\/portfolio\/minute-burger\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bluethumb project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/minute_burger_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Minute Burger by Bluethumb\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo was pretty painful to look at&#8230; from the holding shape, to the typeface, to the bevels, it was all an assault on graphic decency, not to mention there was far too much focus on &#8220;minute&#8221; with the literal depiction of a stopwatch and not enough on &#8220;burger&#8221;. The new logo charmingly fuses the two, with a hamburger where the top bun alludes to a watch with its cute sesame seeds acting as the hour markers. The holding shape remains in place, most likely because they have to fit the new logo in old signs, so we&#8217;ll allow it. The new typography is kinda great. I don&#8217;t think I would ever choose it myself but I really enjoy it. Now, this is not a great-great logo&#8230; there is a lot that could be done to improve the shape of the buns and integrate them better with the type but as an evolution over the old, it&#8217;s a positive improvement.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/minute_burger_guidelines.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Minute Burger by Bluethumb\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/minute_burger_guidelines_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Minute Burger by Bluethumb\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/minute_burger_guidelines_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Minute Burger by Bluethumb\" \/>\n<figcaption>Guidelines.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/minute_burger_logo_with_stuff.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Minute Burger by Bluethumb\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo with stuff.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/minute_burger_packaging_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Minute Burger by Bluethumb\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/minute_burger_packaging_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Minute Burger by Bluethumb\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/minute_burger_packaging_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Minute Burger by Bluethumb\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/minute_burger_packaging_04.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Minute Burger by Bluethumb\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/minute_burger_packaging_05.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Minute Burger by Bluethumb\" \/>\n<figcaption>Packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The packaging isn&#8217;t great-great either &#8212; I know I&#8217;m going to sound repetitive on this but this is my general feeling about the project &#8212; but it&#8217;s effective. It&#8217;s effusive in the box, creating a sense of excitement of what you are about to eat and it&#8217;s heavily branded on the cups which oftentimes make their way out of the restaurant with patrons so they become moving brand touchpoints. The photo-driven exploding patterns are not exactly appetizing (at least not to me) but they are kind of fun and paired with the hand-drawn illustrations start to create a sense of whimsy and looseness in the brand.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/minute_burger_render_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Minute Burger by Bluethumb\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/minute_burger_render_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Minute Burger by Bluethumb\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/minute_burger_render_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Minute Burger by Bluethumb\" \/>\n<figcaption>Retail renders.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/minute_burger_actual_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Minute Burger by Bluethumb\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/minute_burger_actual_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Minute Burger by Bluethumb\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/minute_burger_actual_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Minute Burger by Bluethumb\" \/>\n<figcaption>Retail IRL.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The retail locations are tightly packed and the yellow and orange interiors emanate from the inside giving the stores a fun glow. Seeing the wordmark out of the bun on the front of the store, it reminded me of <a href=\"https:\/\/evolutionofthelogos.weebly.com\/brand-logo-history\/burger-king\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Burger King&#8217;s old (and older) logo<\/a>, which I guess is a good thing as those were some good burger logos.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/minute_burger_uniform_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Minute Burger by Bluethumb\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/minute_burger_uniform_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Minute Burger by Bluethumb\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/minute_burger_uniform_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Minute Burger by Bluethumb\" \/>\n<figcaption>Uniform.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/337962226?title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"360\" height=\"203\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>New identity presentation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">Overall, this isn&#8217;t great-great (again, sorry) but I feel like it&#8217;s a highly appropriate redesign that undoubtedly improves on what was before but it doesn&#8217;t try to be cooler or fancier or more sophisticated than it is. It maintains the feeling that this is a place where you can get a good burger treat, fast, easy, and fun. As a tourist, it would be the kind of place that looks local with a loyal following and I would totally give it a try.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1982, Minute Burger is a fast food hamburger retail restaurant in the Philippines with 600 locations open 24\/7.
