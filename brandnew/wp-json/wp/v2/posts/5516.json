These take over everything, from the interior&#8217;s walls and aforementioned marble display case to the packaging, stickers, and every other application. Check out <a href=\"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/162038412\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this video<\/a> touring the mini shop and showing more of the applications. The result may not be your usual design cool but it has attitude and personality to spare. I almost forgot to mention that it solely uses Cooper Black, which, to me, is always a win. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/farmgroup.co.th\/portfolio\/holy-moly\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">RPSA by brandcraft<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_rpsa.jpg\" alt=\"SRPSA by brandcraft\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">RPSA is the work\/life moniker of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sweetgreek.com.au\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Romain Aubert<\/a>, a self-starter, tech-world consultant living in Hong Kong but hailing from France &#8212; he has also sailed over 8,000 miles. This background is captured all in the logo by Hong Kong-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.brandcraft.hk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">brandcraft<\/a>: &#8220;The crest is designed to abstractly represent an olive tree and its roots and a ship&#8217;s hull and the waves of the ocean.&#8221; The icon is beautifully crafted and, indeed, can have multiple reads but, also, if you have no idea what it means it&#8217;s just damn pretty to look at. The logo is minimally applied to stationery in silver ink and foil and complemented with lovely serif typography, making it just a tad more subdued than Holy Moly above. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.brandcraft.hk\/work\/rpsa\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Maneki by Studio Beau<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_maneki.jpg\" alt=\"Maneki by Studio Beau\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.restaurantmaneki.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Maneki<\/a> is a Pan-Asian counter restaurant in Montr\u00e9al, Quebec, serving a mix of dishes in a rather lively and colorful setting. The identity by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/beau.designbureau.ca\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Studio Beau<\/a> purposely takes Asian stereotypes and clich\u00e9s to deliver an eclectic, vibrant, set of illustrations and in-your-face typography that may not be to everyone&#8217;s taste but is undeniably attention-grabbing. The logo itself is a super funky wordmark that challenges readability but ultimately makes for a highly distinctive logo&#8230; one that looks extra electric in neon. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/52745019\/Maneki\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Unplanned, all three projects this week have an Asian influence by design or setting, with work from Bangkok, Hong Kong, and Montr\u00e9al&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,85,26],"tags":[784,105,564],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5516"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=5516"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5516\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=5516"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=5516"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=5516"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
