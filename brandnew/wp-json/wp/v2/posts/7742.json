It remains highly relevant to our lives today and for the future. It is the home of British codebreaking and a birthplace of modern information technology. It played a major role in World War Two, producing secret intelligence which had a direct and profound influence on the outcome of the conflict. Over the past twenty years Bletchley Park has become an internationally renowned heritage attraction, visited by people from around the world, which acknowledges the successes from the War and the people responsible for them. It celebrates their values: broad-minded patriotism; commitment; discipline; technological excellence. By presenting and explaining these achievements and these values, in the very place where they occurred, Bletchley Park brings together the dramatic history of the twentieth century with the challenges we face in the twenty first in our rapidly changing and technologically complex society. Public interest in Bletchley Park has grown enormously over the past few years and the number of visitors to Bletchley Park in 2016 was over 250,000.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>This identity project is specific to a new exhibit, <a href=\"https:\/\/bletchleypark.org.uk\/whats-on\/d-day-interception-intelligence-invasion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">D-Day: Interception, Intelligence, Invasion<\/a>, commemorating the 75th anniversary of D-Day.<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/d_day_75th_anniversary_logo.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for D-Day Exhibit by Rose\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/d_day_75th_anniversary_posters.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for D-Day Exhibit by Rose\" \/>\n<figcaption>Posters.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/d_day_75th_anniversary_ad.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for D-Day Exhibit by Rose\" \/>\n<figcaption>Ad.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/d_day_75th_anniversary_bag.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for D-Day Exhibit by Rose\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/d_day_75th_anniversary_gift.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for D-Day Exhibit by Rose\" \/>\n<figcaption>Gift shop materials.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/d_day_75th_anniversary_scarf.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for D-Day Exhibit by Rose\" \/>\n<figcaption>Scarf.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/d_day_75th_anniversary_bookmark.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for D-Day Exhibit by Rose\" \/>\n<figcaption>Bookmark.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/d_day_75th_anniversary_frame.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for D-Day Exhibit by Rose\" \/>\n<figcaption>Limited-edition artwork (1\/75) of a folded piece of ticker tape.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/d_day_75th_anniversary_sculpture.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for D-Day Exhibit by Rose\" \/>\n<figcaption>Memorial sculpture.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/339936488?title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"360\" height=\"203\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Identity presentation.
