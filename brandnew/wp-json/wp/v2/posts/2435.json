Over the weekend, Acumen shortened its name, introduced a new identity designed by London-based <a href=\"http:\/\/johnsonbanks.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">johnson banks<\/a>, and launched a new website by <a href=\"http:\/\/briteweb.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">briteweb<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>Their &#8216;A&#8217; is deliberately left unfinished, to communicate that their work is never complete, that they don&#8217;t have all the answers, and that they can&#8217;t change the way the world tackles poverty alone.

It makes capital work for us, not control us.\n<br \/><br \/>\nIt thrives on moral imagination: the humility to see the world as it is, and the audacity to imagine the world as it could be. It&#8217;s having the ambition to learn at the edge, the wisdom to admit failure, and the courage to start again.\n<br \/><br \/>\nIt requires patience and kindness, resilience and grit: a hard-edged hope. It&#8217;s leadership that rejects complacency, breaks through bureaucracy, challenges corruption, and does what&#8217;s right, not what&#8217;s easy.\n<br \/><br \/>\nAcumen: it&#8217;s the radical idea of creating hope in a cynical world.

The new logo, or, well, the new family of logos is quite the contrary and crystal clear what it is: it&#8217;s spelled out right there. Built from bits and pieces of Acumen&#8217;s new cornerstone manifesto, the logo is one more in a rising trend of what johnson banks&#8217; is calling &#8220;active identities&#8221; and they&#8217;ve been on a kick with them lately &mdash; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cystic_fribrosis_looking_good.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">see Cystic Fibrosis Fund<\/a> &mdash; and build on a legacy of identities like We Are Macmillan and YWCA. Acumen&#8217;s logo features a sliced slab serif &#8220;A&#8221; used XL accompanied by a waterfall of Avant Garde, starting with the name in bold and then one of the manifesto excerpts or some other sentence below, staggered in a lighter weight. Love the half &#8220;A&#8221;, hate the use of Avant Garde. The idea is quite brilliant and the whole concept of pushing the manifesto through the logo is an excellent way of building awareness but I wish the typography was more reminiscent of, like, today and the twenty-first century rather than the 1960s and 70s. Of course, the people donating to Acumen and the business leaders seeking investment don&#8217;t care about such historical typographic conundrums, so the identity is obviously successful in the marketplace &mdash; although I do question the readability of light, tightly-tracked uppercase writing, it starts getting fuzzy at smaller sizes.<\/p>\n<p>Nonetheless, despite my grievances about designers using musty typography, this identity cuts starkly (in a positive way) against the presence of other non-profits and helps establish what Acumen is with every single impression.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/acumen_05_folder_574.jpg\" alt=\"Acumen Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Folder cover.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/acumen_06_ournal_covers_574.jpg\" alt=\"Acumen Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Journal covers.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/acumen_07_phone_574.jpg\" alt=\"Acumen Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">App and icons.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/acumen_08_office_574.jpg\" alt=\"Acumen Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Welcome.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_130423_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_130423_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_130423_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_130423_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_130423_config_03.xml&#038;xyz=poll_130423_votes_03.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv3\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv3\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,79,26],"tags":[864,617,179,296,411],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2435"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2435"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2435\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2435"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2435"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2435"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
