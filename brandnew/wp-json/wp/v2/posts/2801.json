The shapes and the flow of the dancer&#8217;s costume are the reflection of the colours of different national flags and mixed cultures.<br \/><br \/>The power of a culture embracing the culture of the game.<br \/>A leap towards the future of basketball in Ukraine. A Jump Forward together.<br \/>&bull; The embrace and welcoming approach to Europe&#8217;s best players and fans.<br \/>&bull; The mixed emotions of the game.<br \/>&bull; The joy of celebration, the explosion of victory reflected in a Jump.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.fibaeurope.com\/coid_QxO7Bk3cHrwZ2eB4rttzE0.articleMode_on.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FIBA press release<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/eurobasket_2015_hopak.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for EuroBasket 2015 by Brandia Central\" \/>\n<figcaption>Ukrainian folk dance, Hopak.

Yet, here it is. A logo that at first looks like a basketball with some odd splats around it converted into a clever hopak dancer using the natural ridges of the ball. It&#8217;s not the most attractive shape in the world but it&#8217;s intensely appropriate and relevant. Even the full-color gradients and shadings feel in place although it doesn&#8217;t quite resolve as a single flat color when they have applied a second set of ridges going in the opposite direction. While I enjoy the &#8220;EuroBasket&#8221; stencil and rounded sans version of Museo I (obviously) dislike how the rest of the typography in the logo (and identity) relies solely on Museo.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/eurobasket_2015_app_figures.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for EuroBasket 2015 by Brandia Central\" \/>\n<figcaption>Figures and icons.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/eurobasket_2015_app_tee_tote.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for EuroBasket 2015 by Brandia Central\" \/>\n<figcaption>Tees and totes.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/eurobasket_2015_ads.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for EuroBasket 2015 by Brandia Central\" \/>\n<figcaption>Outdoor ads.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">For application there are additional hopak figurines that look great and capture the essence of basketball quite elegantly. There is also a set of icons that, in contrast, feel too rigid and corporate. The only thing that ties them together is the heavy use of gradients. Which is fine, but it isn&#8217;t my favorite style. Overall, a very tight concept that has considered quite beautifully the host country and applied with plenty of visual energy.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Played since 1935, EuroBasket (or European Basketball Championship for long) is the main basketball competition held every two years for all the men&apos;s national teams that are part of FIBA Europe with 24 teams qualifying for the tournament.
