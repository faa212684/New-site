I saw this project on Brandemia earlier in the week and was going to do a Review of it but it&#8217;s a change from 2014 so it was old news. While it&#8217;s not a typical Friday Like, I really liked the project, especially for a major network and I most appreciated a different take on the flexible logo approach. Designed by Lima-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.brandlab.pe\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brandlab<\/a>, the main logo features a bold &#8220;L&#8221; with a striped stem which is nice enough in itself but then the stem can change to music notes, happy faces, hearts, a film strip, and more. It&#8217;s fun and charming. In animation, with <a href=\"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/126381187\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">on-air graphics by Superestudio<\/a>, the different logos come alive wonderfully and help characterize the programming. The color palette is of the burn-your-retina variety, which I like and in Peru, bursts of color are never a problem. As a bonus, scroll to the end of the project link to see the before logo; makes you appreciate the result even more. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.brandlab.pe\/Latina-TV\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Estudio Duna by Raimundo Britto<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_duna.jpg\" alt=\"Estudio Duna by Raimundo Britto\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/estudioduna\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Estudio Duna<\/a> is the design business of Salvador, Brazil-based designer <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/raimundobritto\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Raimundo Britto<\/a>, who was included in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_147.php#.V1qYyWQrKcY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Friday Likes 147<\/a> for his Via Bahia project. Raimundo chose the name Duna (Dune in English as in the movie, yes, but also as in the mountain of sand) for its shortness and coolness. This is another atypical Friday Like in that it&#8217;s not as &#8220;happy&#8221; as the usual selections and probably not &#8220;good&#8221; in the typical sense and that&#8217;s what I liked about it, that it&#8217;s mostly going in its own, off-kilter visual direction. The different Duna wordmarks splattered using Photoshop &#8212; unfortunately, because it would have been a home run if he had done this in actual sand &#8212; are dynamic and have some great tension. The applications, which I have the feeling are not actually produced, are strong too, particularly the business cards. You dune you, Raimundo!  <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/37089931\/Estudio-Duna\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Arde by IS Creative Studio<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_arde.jpg\" alt=\"Arde by IS Creative Studio\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.arde.pe\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ARDE<\/a>, short for &#8220;Arquitectura Dise\u00f1o y Espacio&#8221; is a design and architecture studio in Lima, Peru. The logo, designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/iscreativestudio.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">IS Creative Studio<\/a> is a rare sighting of a harsh, angular wordmark that doesn&#8217;t aim to be friendly, hip, or accessible but about conveying precision and simplicity. In other words, I dig. Not to heap too much praise on it but my first reaction was that it looked Wim Crouwel-esque. There is only one application, a business card and it&#8217;s pure hotness with some fluorescent inks and the embossed logo. Somewhat related, &#8220;arde&#8221; in Spanish translates to &#8220;It burns&#8221; in English and since this is en fuego, it&#8217;s all a ton of great brand synergy. <a href=\"http:\/\/iscreativestudio.com\/project\/arde\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Two extra colorful Peruvian projects sandwich a dark and moody one with work from Lima, Salvador, and Lima&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[953,1074,189],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4737"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4737"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4737\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4737"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4737"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4737"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
