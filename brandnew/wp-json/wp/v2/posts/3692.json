In their words, though, they are more than just a credit bureau, they are &#8220;[An] information company. And we&#8217;re a force for good,&#8221; helping &#8220;uncover unique stories, trends and insights behind each data point, using historical information as well as alternative data sources&#8221;. At the end of the day, they provide what you want to know: Have I paid my bills in good enough fashion to get this new car\/home\/flat-screen-tv? This week, TransUnion introduced a new identity designed by Chicago, IL-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.avenue-inc.com\/work\/transunion-case-study\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Avenue<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>TransUnion wanted to emphasize this friendliness and put its biggest asset front and center: its people.<br \/><br \/>We chose a bright, bold palette, minimalist design and friendly language to help communicate the values of the company. The identity is welcoming and approachable &mdash; just like TransUnion. The stamp at the end of the identity capitalizes on the company&#8217;s informal name, TU. It serves as a seal of quality that will grow in authority and value with every positive experience customers and associates have with TransUnion. And we revamped the language, cutting the jargon and letting the brand&#8217;s personality shine through.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/22254959\/TransUnion-Rebrand\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Avenue Behance project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/transunion_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for TransUnion by Avenue\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo was relatively crazy and New-Wave-like for a credit bureau headquartered in the Midwest. Nonetheless, it wasn&#8217;t great and the double-&#8220;T&#8221; monogram kinda forgot about the &#8220;U&#8221; in its name. The new logo addresses this squarely (or, circle-y) with the new &#8220;tu&#8221; monogram that looks half @ symbol and half giant registered mark; its execution is a little wonky and odd &mdash; if you&#8217;ve ever tried to turn a letter into an @ symbol you know how weird it is to make that first curve. In this case, starting the circle out of the tail of the &#8220;u&#8221; would have probably been more comfortable. The monogram is paired with a wordmark typeset in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.myfonts.com\/fonts\/font-fabric\/intro\/?refby=ucllc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Intro<\/a>, becoming a little repetitive: there isn&#8217;t that big a difference in style between the wordmark and the monogram, and it basically reads &#8220;TransUnion TransUnion&#8221;. The new logo certainly delivers on the friendliness promise of the quote above, but perhaps succeeds too much in what feels like an overly friendly, standalone logo.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/114255561?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=ffffff\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>New identity overview.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/transunion_icons_animated.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for TransUnion by Avenue\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icons, animated.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/transunion_icons.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for TransUnion by Avenue\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icon set.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/transunion_bizcard_tshirt_pins_tote.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for TransUnion by Avenue\" \/>\n<figcaption>Various materials.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/transunion_posters.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for TransUnion by Avenue\" \/>\n<figcaption>Posters.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/transunion_brand_brochure_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for TransUnion by Avenue\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/transunion_brand_brochure_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for TransUnion by Avenue\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brand brochure.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">The rest of the identity, however, benefits quite well from the amiable approach, making TransUnion feel less like a bank and more like a fun, approachable retail operation that will always provide good news on your credit score. The snowflake-like use of the monogram almost makes it look like coins, raining positive finances on your future. While I&#8217;m not a huge fan of the pronounced half serifs of Intro, I realize I may be on my own in not fully liking all the applications but I definitely acknowledge it all works well, particularly when bold, all caps are mixed in. Overall, a good evolution that no doubt turns TransUnion into a consumer-friendly business.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1968, TransUnion is a credit bureau, providing consumer credit score information to approximately 45,000 businesses and 500 million consumers worldwide, making it one of the largest consumer reporting agencies in the U.S., along with Equifax and Experian.
