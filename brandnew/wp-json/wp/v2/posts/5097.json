Developed and fabricated in Ukraine, Kiev, they offer ovens, fryers, and stove (or range) hoods, and built-in refrigerators and dishwashers, among others. Their ovens have been the official oven for the past three years in <a href=\"http:\/\/masterchef.stb.ua\/ru\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the Ukrainian version<\/a> of the cooking show <em>Master Chef<\/em> and they&#8217;ve paired with fashion designers to create limited edition lines. This month, Pyramida introduced a new identity designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/reynoldsandreyner.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Reynolds &amp; Reyner<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>The updated style reflects the key standards of the new generation equipment production in its best way. You will never find fancy d\u00e9cor here, while the exceptionally corporate identity smile element taken from Y letter of the title appears within the main purple background. Such smiles are easily combined in funny patterns thus dramatically increasing brand recognition level. The red square existing in the previous style never disappeared but found its renaissance within the structure of P, A, M and D letters of the name, providing the font with the own unique style.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/reynoldsandreyner.com\/pyramida\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Reynolds &amp; Reyner project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pyramida_old_look.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Pyramida by Reynolds &amp; Reyner\" \/>\n<figcaption>Old look.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pyramida_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Pyramida by Reynolds &amp; Reyner\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pyramida_logo_construction.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Pyramida by Reynolds &amp; Reyner\" \/>\n<figcaption>Construction. \u0ca0_\u0ca0<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>I&#8217;ll first say that this project could have easily passed as a Noted instead of Reviewed but I thought it would be good to turn the focus on a smaller market (that being home appliances in Ukraine). The old logo was typeset in none other than Arial but, to its credit, someone letterspaced and kerned it to some successful degree. The red square to the side was as default and lacking in creative intention as the font choice. The new logo clearly aims for something more unique, memorable, and has that creative intention that was missing from the old but perhaps it got carried away.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m oddly attracted to the tension created in the corners of the &#8220;p&#8221;, &#8220;a&#8221;s, and &#8220;d&#8221;&#8230; there is something uncomfortable but cool about them that other hard-geometry wordmarks haven&#8217;t done (perhaps for a reason). The &#8220;y&#8221;, however, is very distracting and breaks the rhythm of the wordmark with its detached descender, which later becomes the key element of the identity as it turns into a smile. Reminds-me-of supporters might be reminded of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/new_logo_and_identity_for_logitech_by_designstudio.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">recent Logitech redesign<\/a>; what I think made the &#8220;g&#8221;&#8216;s descender work in that instance was that it was the main and sole visual distinction, allowing it to stand out, whereas here it&#8217;s one of many graphic tricks the logo is trying to pull off.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pyramida_appliances_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Pyramida by Reynolds &amp; Reyner\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pyramida_appliances_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Pyramida by Reynolds &amp; Reyner\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pyramida_appliances_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Pyramida by Reynolds &amp; Reyner\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo on appliances.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Shown on the appliances, the logo becomes more convincing but the &#8220;y&#8221; still always jumps out as the character that doesn&#8217;t belong with the rest.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pyramida_moodboardy_thing.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Pyramida by Reynolds &amp; Reyner\" \/>\n<figcaption>Moodboard kind of thing.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pyramida_patterns.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Pyramida by Reynolds &amp; Reyner\" \/>\n<figcaption>Patterns.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pyramida_materials_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Pyramida by Reynolds &amp; Reyner\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pyramida_materials_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Pyramida by Reynolds &amp; Reyner\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pyramida_materials_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Pyramida by Reynolds &amp; Reyner\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pyramida_materials_04.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Pyramida by Reynolds &amp; Reyner\" \/>\n<figcaption>Various materials.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The identity then tries to veer into more happy and retail-friendly territory by turning the descender of the &#8220;y&#8221; into a series of patterns in very colorful combinations. I&#8217;m not exactly sure what the above boxes are&#8230; either they are all huge enough to fit stoves and hoods or they are also selling small consumer electronics. Or, most likely, the design firm is trying to make a case for the flexibility of their identity. I kind of want to like them, simply because they are vibrant, cheerful designs but I&#8217;m not convinced they fit the product.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pyramida_illustration_01.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Pyramida by Reynolds &amp; Reyner\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pyramida_illustration_02.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Pyramida by Reynolds &amp; Reyner\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pyramida_illustration_applications.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Pyramida by Reynolds &amp; Reyner\" \/>\n<figcaption>Illustrations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">The identity takes a turn for the worse with the descender of the &#8220;y&#8221; used to make too-cute-for-their-own-good illustrations that make no sense for the products: magnets? birds? sea? Overall, this is a step in the right direction to make the brand feel more like an accessible consumer product and one with a distinct tone of voice but perhaps they went too far with the playfulness that makes it look as if picking out a range hood is as easy as buying a Fitbit.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 2001, Pyramida is one of the leading retail designers and manufactures of home appliances in the Ukrainian market.
