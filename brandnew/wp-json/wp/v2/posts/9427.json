The company started in Australia and moved into the U.S. market in 2018, where, this year, its number of customers here (3.6 million) has surpassed those in Australia (3.1 million) although it still has many more retailers using their system there (35,000+ vs. 7,000+). It&#8217;s also available in New Zealand and the UK (where it is known as Clearpay) serving in total more than 10 million customers and partnering with more than 55,000 retailers.

YummyColours reimagined the two arrows prominent in the original logo design into a linked, continuous form that evokes balance and interconnectedness. The resulting logo represents how the relationships between Afterpay, their partner merchants and customers are continually strengthened each time they interact with one another.<\/blockquote><h3> YummyColours provided text<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/444397749?title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"360\" height=\"203\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\r\n<figcaption>Logo evolution video.<\/figcaption>\r\n<\/figure>\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"full\">\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/afterpay_logo_before_after_analysis.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Afterpay by YummyColours\" \/>\r\n<figcaption>Before and after logo analysis \u2014 does this mean I don&#8217;t have to do my job anymore?<\/figcaption>\r\n<\/figure>\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"full\">\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/afterpay_logo_before_after_analysis_icon.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Afterpay by YummyColours\" \/>\r\n<figcaption>Icon before-to-after transformation.<\/figcaption>\r\n<\/figure>\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"full\">\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/afterpay_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Afterpay by YummyColours\" \/>\r\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\r\n<\/figure>\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"full\">\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/afterpay_logo_color_variations.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Afterpay by YummyColours\" \/>\r\n<figcaption>Color variations.<\/figcaption>\r\n<\/figure>\r\n\r\n<p>The old logo had some strong <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/new_logo_and_identity_for_paypal_by_fuseproject.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">old PayPal logo vibes<\/a> with the use of the two shades of blue and the hard angle of the \u201cp\u201d that reminded me of the italic-ness of PayPal. Typographically it was a real mess with every letter looking different from the next and an icon that didn&#8217;t really quite make sense \u2014 I mean, I get that maybe it was supposed to be an \u201cA\u201d and a \u201cP\u201d but it was a stretch. The new icon takes the two weird arrows and merges them into a single, weird arrow and its rationalization induces heavy eye-rolling. Nonetheless, at a quick glance, the icon is somewhat unique and relevant in the sense that, sure, it visualizes in a fairly literal way the connection between merchants and consumers. At a detailed glance, it&#8217;s not pretty\u2026 there is something very uncomfortable about the twists and turns the icon takes, the very large size of the arrows in the negative space, and the way the open joints end. Its very visible rounded and soft corners contrast strangely with the wordmark, which is nice on its own in that generic geometric sans serif style, but really clashes with the icon. Again, the strange thing is that the logo looks fine and it will work but it comes up short in execution and consistency at the base level.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"full\">\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/afterpay_logo_system.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Afterpay by YummyColours\" \/>\r\n<figcaption>Logo system.<\/figcaption>\r\n<\/figure>\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"full\">\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/afterpay_logo_assets_a.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Afterpay by YummyColours\" \/>\r\n<figcaption>Logo assets.<\/figcaption>\r\n<\/figure>\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/444592907?title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0&#038;autoplay=1&#038;loop=1&#038;autopause=0&#038;background=1&#038;muted=1\" width=\"360\" height=\"203\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\r\n<figcaption>Badges<\/figcaption>\r\n<\/figure>\r\n\r\n<p>As you can see above, yeah, this is all quite fine so it&#8217;s hard to argue against the details of the logo\u2026 yet I (and am guessing some of you) will still do so that&#8217;s fine too.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"full\">\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/afterpay_icon_set.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Afterpay by YummyColours\" \/>\r\n<figcaption>Icon set.<\/figcaption>\r\n<\/figure>\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"full\">\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/afterpay_wave_and_patterns.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Afterpay by YummyColours\" \/>\r\n<figcaption>Patterns.<\/figcaption>\r\n<\/figure>\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"full\">\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/afterpay_type_treatments.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Afterpay by YummyColours\" \/>\r\n<hr \/>\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/afterpay_guidelines_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Afterpay by YummyColours\" \/>\r\n<figcaption>Typography treatments.<\/figcaption>\r\n<\/figure>\r\n\r\n<p>The typographic system is kind of nice and I think the sans-serif-geometric-ness of <a href=\"https:\/\/playtype.com\/typefaces\/italian-plate-no2-expanded\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Italian Plate No2 Expanded<\/a> gets saved by its numerals, which are quite nice and give the identity a slight edge.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"full\">\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/afterpay_guidelines_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Afterpay by YummyColours\" \/>\r\n<figcaption>Guidelines.<\/figcaption>\r\n<\/figure>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Furthermore, YummyColours used this unique opportunity to design a custom new signature colour for Afterpay in collaboration with Pantone Colour Institute: Afterpay Bondi Mint. Taking cue from the eponymous surfing destination, Afterpay Bondi Mint recalls fresh, sweeping waves of a popular Australian locale. \u201cColour is one of the easiest and most effective ways to highlight to a consumer the unique qualities and promise behind the brand,\u201d notes Laurie Pressman, VP at Pantone Color Institute, \u201cbecause the colour a brand chooses to present themselves is the most tangible representation of who they are. Bondi Mint boldly anchors Afterpay\u2019s visual language, distinguishing the brand within the landscape of Buy Now Pay Later companies, and rooting it in youthful, forward-thinking Australian culture with human connection at the core.<\/blockquote><h3> YummyColours provided text<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"full\">\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/afterpay_bondi_mint_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Afterpay by YummyColours\" \/>\r\n<figcaption>Official Afterpay Bondi Mint Pantone color.

The layout system video attempts to make it look more complex than it is but there is really not that much going on other than full-bleed photos, full-bleed color backgrounds, and black type. Nothing wrong with it but nothing exciting about it either. Elevating the icon to hero status in some places (like the image with the guy running or the ad with the repeating background) is unfortunately not that flattering as the icon is not that strong. Overall, despite my lack of enthusiasm for it, this has the right fintech patina and the novelty of the proprietary mint color is a nice conversation starter but, <em>after<\/em> that, not much to get excited by.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Established in 2015, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.afterpay.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Afterpay<\/a> is an international payments platform that  &#8220;enables financial wellness for the next generation of shoppers&#8221; \u2014 what that means is that it allows consumers to buy-now and pay-later (in four installments) on select retailers both online and in-store.
