For the start of the 2017 season, Fuse introduced a new on-air look designed by New York, NY-based <a href=\"http:\/\/notclosed.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Open<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fuse_2017_old_look.jpg\" alt=\"New On-air Look for Fuse by Open\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stills from the on-air look introduced in 2015. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/new_logo_and_on-air_package_for_fuse_done_in_house.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Here<\/a> is the Brand New post about it.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fuse_2017_logo.png\" alt=\"New On-air Look for Fuse by Open\" \/>\n<figcaption>The logo was not changed, except that now it&#8217;s used always in white.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old look was interesting in that it committed to a funky color palette, a trailing-color effect, and even created some unique footage for its on-air look.  But given its specificity I think it had a clear expiration date. In 2015, they also redesigned the logo, switching from one sans to another but adding a fragmented structure to the logo, which is now gone, thankfully, as it was rather awkward.<\/p>\n<blockquote>America in 2017 is a country that sees itself in a lot of different ways, full of people who see themselves in lots of different ways. Every one of us identifies as more than one thing. Not just in terms of race and gender, but also in terms of culture and interest and personality and who knows what else. <br \/><br \/>So you might be a <strong>SINGER\/SONGWRITER<\/strong> or a <strong>STUDENT\/BARISTA<\/strong> or an <strong>ACCOUNTANT\/DJ<\/strong>. Maybe you&#8217;re <strong>COLOMBIAN\/AMERICAN<\/strong> or drink <strong>COFFEE\/TEA\/BOOZE<\/strong> from a mug in your office in <strong>GLENDALE\/L.A.\/CALIFORNIA<\/strong>. Each of these tells a little story by stringing together different ways of looking at the same thing.<br \/><br \/>Which pronouns does Big Freedia prefer? The answer is a story unto itself: <strong>HE\/SHE\/DIVA<\/strong>. So is the latest season of Fluffy: <strong>MORE CITIES\/MORE FOOD\/MORE FLUFFY<\/strong>. Indivisible is too: <strong>IMMIGRANT\/DREAMER\/AMERICAN<\/strong>. Everything that Fuse does is part of one big story&#8211; the story of America today.<\/blockquote><h3>Fuse 2017 Style Guidelines<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fuse_2017_parts.jpg\" alt=\"New On-air Look for Fuse by Open\" \/>\n<figcaption>The identity elements (clockwise): Type + slash, stickers of the talent, animated GIFs, and emojis.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The ingredients of the new on-air look (and advertising and other print and digital applications) are unapologetically of the time, combining the lingua franca of kidz-these-days (and adultz too, to be honest) of emojis and animated GIFs. Like the on-air look before it, this kind of puts a clear expiration date on it, which will run out in a year or two possibly, which is fine, as I think Fuse has no problem in being a changing reflection of the audience.<\/p>\n<p>The ingredients are purposely crude\/naive &#8212; from the open source emojis to the crummy-resolution GIFs, and even to the slightly awkward <a href=\"https:\/\/www.myfonts.com\/fonts\/linotype\/plak\/?refby=ucllc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Plak<\/a> font (a 1930 sans serif by Paul Renner, he of Futura fame) &#8212; and they quickly help establish a quirky, rapid-fire, unconcerned tone of voice that provides a clear personality for the channel.<\/p>\n<blockquote>Combining the language of texting, tweets, and the internet, FuseSpeak gets straight to the point and grabs your attention.

To a degree, it feels unfinished at times but, by the same token, the lack of apparent polish is a nice alternative to some of the other on-air looks where every pixel and second is finessed to the nth degree (which is not a bad thing, just the norm).<\/p>\n<blockquote>Borrowing from the language of swiping, scrolling, and scrubbing&#8211;our motion mimics that of touchscreens, and smart phones.

Like the arrangements of the ingredients, the motion is simple but smooth and appropriate to highlight the information as needed.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fuse_2017_stationery.jpg\" alt=\"New On-air Look for Fuse by Open\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stationery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fuse_2017_mug.jpg\" alt=\"New On-air Look for Fuse by Open\" \/>\n<figcaption>Mug.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">The on-air look also extends nicely to static and print applications, where the density of typography and playful copywriting can communicate the personality of the channel. Overall, this is a fun evolution that separates Fuse from the frenetic MTV-esque on-air looks or the overly cinematic and even if the emojis and GIFs get tired quickly, there is a potential for this structure to evolve in future seasons.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Launched in 2003, Fuse &#8212; replacing MuchMusic (launched 1994) &#8212; is a TV channel with a combined focus on music, comedy, and culture, offering original series and specials, interviews, live concerts, blocks of music videos, and documentaries, targeting a young,&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[66,12,26],"tags":[287,1343,290,1489,42],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5947"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=5947"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5947\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=5947"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=5947"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=5947"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
