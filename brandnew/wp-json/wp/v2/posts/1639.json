Since being founded in 1896, <em>House Beautiful<\/em> remains the oldest continuously published shelter magazine in the United States. In 1936, <em>House Beautiful<\/em> was purchased by Hearst Corporation, who continues to publish the magazine. In September, the magazine rolled out a new editorial design and an updated wordmark crafted by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mickeldesign.com\/projects\/house-beautiful\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jeremy Mickel<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>Updated Logo: This September, <em>House Beautiful<\/em> reveals an updated logo featuring rounder, softer letters that reflect a slightly more feminine, youthful spirit that is easier to read.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.marketwire.com\/press-release\/house-beautifuls-september-issue-is-refreshed-with-new-columns-updated-logo-and-more-1545654.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press Release<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/house_beautiful_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"House Beautiful Logo, Before and After\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The new wordmark does feature everything that was requested in the brief given: youthful and soft. The addition of the curved and ball terminals add a nice flare, bounce, and life to the mark compared to the previous cold and strict design. However, they do get overplayed a bit, particularly in the unfortunately distracting &#8220;s&#8221; of &#8220;House.&#8221; The lack of the presence of terminals in other parts of &#8220;House&#8221; make the &#8220;s&#8221; feel a bit forced and disconnected from the wordmark.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/house_beautiful_cover.jpg\" alt=\"House Beautiful Logo, Before and After\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As for the second portion of the wordmark, &#8220;Beautiful&#8221; works pretty beautifully &mdash; if you will. The use of the terminals in moderation feels very comfortable and natural. Nothing overbearing or forced is the key. The latter end of &#8220;Beautiful&#8221; could be kerned more in comparison to the former, but I digress. On the plus side, the overall letter spacing of the wordmark does allow for greater readability compared to its predecessor. This lends itself to a decent updated wordmark that follows instructions, but doesn&#8217;t move mountains.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mableyhandler.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Austin Handler<\/a> for the tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_110914_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_110914_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"574\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":12,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,82,26],"tags":[108,196,33],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1639"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/12"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1639"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1639\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1639"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1639"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1639"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
