Its main competitor, Kickstarter, launched in 2009, has more critical mass behind it but one advantage of Indiegogo is its &#8220;Flexible Funding&#8221; option where a user gets to keep any funding received as opposed to none at all if the goal is not met. Today, Indiegogo is introducing a new identity designed by Los Angeles, CA-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pushoffices.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PUSH Offices<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/u4tZWpYTso4\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Brand video.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>[&hellip;] The updated branding captures the spirit of Indiegogo&#8217;s core value propositions of open, global and customer-focused.<br \/><br \/>In particular, the dynamic logo embraces the customer in a unique and original way. Filled with an image from a prior Indiegogo campaign, the logo represents the company&#8217;s mission to work hand-in-hand with campaigners to democratize finance and give people around the world the power to fund what matters to them. To highlight the breadth, depth and reach of its ecosystem, the logo will showcase a different campaign every time the user refreshes the screen.<\/blockquote><h3>Press release<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/indiegogo_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo for Indiegogo by PUSH Offices\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/indiegogo_logo_various.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Indiegogo by PUSH Offices\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo variations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The previous logo, despite its start-up-y typography, was rather good with four hearts coming together as a whole, serving as a nice metaphor for community and collaboration. The new logo places emphasis on the projects by serving as a &mdash; yup &mdash; window that can change to show images from the various campaigns it has hosted. The result is very expected and far from innovative but it serves the cause well, as it&#8217;s all about the people and projects that fuel Indiegogo. The blank version of the logo, with the thick stroke is far more successful than the image version and it would have been nice to see a solution for the imagery that kept the stroke. The typography helps highlight the two words that make up the name of the company, particularly in the image version and, in its condensed and contemporary aesthetic, it&#8217;s a good choice that works well with the square\/stroke and also establishes a contrast with the rounded, friendly wordmark of Kickstarter.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/indiegogo_BusinessCards.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Indiegogo by PUSH Offices\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business card.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/indiegogo_website.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Indiegogo by PUSH Offices\" \/>\n<figcaption>Website.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">In application there isn&#8217;t much to see but it seems we can expect a lot of motivational campaign images sprinkled with some dollar amounts. Nothing too rallying for the time being. Overall, the direction of the new identity &mdash; more serious and campaign-focused &mdash; is on the right track but I do feel like they lost something moving away from the heart icon and I can&#8217;t display much enthusiasm for the logo-as-window approach.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Launched in 2008 and headquartered in San Francisco, CA, Indiegogo is the (first and original) crowdfunding platform for users to fund &quot;project-creative, entrepreneurial or cause-related&quot; campaigns.
