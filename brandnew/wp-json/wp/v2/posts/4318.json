Most of its locations so far can be found in shopping malls and airports. Despite being one of the largest single-slice flingers, Sbarro has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy twice this century but now, like Michael Jordan, it&#8217;s making a second comeback. Since the start of the year Sbarro has been remodeling locations around the world and this September announced its first standalone restaurant in Columbus, OH, where they are headquartered along with the formal introduction of a new logo. <strike>No design credit given<\/strike>.

FAST!&#8221;. The new logo is a complete distancing from that aesthetic and helps signal a renewed purpose of better quality. The logo looks decent and now says &#8220;Pizza&#8221; more literally but also more politely. The all uppercase typography makes it look more upscale and the whole logo unit is fairly pleasant.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sbarro_logo_signage.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Retail Look for Sbarro by Sterling Rice Group\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo in different signage styles.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>From what there is available on Instagram, you can see that they are not settling on a single style of reproducing the logo in signage and that creates a nice system where anything is a go and allows Sbarro to look and feel slightly different from location to location. The tilting of the logo is a surprise touch that adds a bit of energy to the identity.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sbarro_mall_location.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Retail Look for Sbarro by Sterling Rice Group\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sbarro_mall_location_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Retail Look for Sbarro by Sterling Rice Group\" \/>\n<figcaption>A couple of updated mall locations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The more official retail dress is shown above and, compared to the image at the beginning of the post, the change is dramatic. It definitely feels like a completely new restaurant that will serve you a relatively tasty slice of pizza. Now, instead of trying to scream at the top of its lungs across shopping malls, the new facades calmly ask you to join them for a meal. The change can potentially hurt Sbarro in the short term as anyone looking for the green-white-red bands in a food court will not find it at all and that sense of comfort will be gone, so it really is up to the food to deliver on the new message it&#8217;s trying to convey.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sbarro_standalone.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Retail Look for Sbarro by Sterling Rice Group\" \/>\n<figcaption>New standalone restaurant in Columbus, OH.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">Overall, this is a risky change as it completely changes the face of Sbarro and it now also fits in the trend of mainstream food offerings going &#8220;artisanal&#8221; &mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fritolay.com\/snacks\/product-page\/tostitos\/tostitos-artisan-recipes-roasted-garlic-black-bean-flavored-tortilla-chips\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Artisan Tostitos anyone?<\/a> &mdash; and getting lost in it.
