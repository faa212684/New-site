In the U.S., they partner with over 700 hospitals, specialty clinics and camps, and respite houses and hospices, where they help kids through a range of efforts like creating Starlight Fun Centers (rooms with a TV, Wii, and other entertainment), or providing &#8220;Brave Gowns&#8221; (high-quality hospital gowns with superhero motif), and Star Visits, where celebrities visit kids. Over the years, Starlight&#8217;s programs have positively impacted more than 60 million children. Earlier this year, the U.S. side of the foundation introduced a new identity designed by Charlottesville, VA-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.weareconvoy.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Convoy<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/starlight_childrens_foundation_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Starlight Children&amp;apos;s Foundation by Convoy\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/starlight_childrens_foundation_logo_stack_inverse.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Starlight Children&amp;apos;s Foundation by Convoy\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stacked and inverse.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo had the visual naivet\u00e9 some nonprofits tend to have. The overly flourished font is hard to take seriously and the kid figure &#8212; although graphically matching the font &#8212; was kind of weird with the kid&#8217;s arms being very thin in order to &#8220;connect&#8221; with the &#8220;l&#8221;. The new logo is a simplified, more ambiguous version of the original. The more realistic kid has been replaced by an abstract human sprite that is kinda charming in its soft, almost Play-Doh-ish construction. Like all sprite human figures, though, there is still something disconcerting about it. Too faceless and shapeless. The wordmark is typeset in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.myfonts.com\/fonts\/central-type\/rodger\/?refby=ucllc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rodger<\/a>, which, in lowercase and the regular weight, makes the logo look a little generic. The black weight and\/or uppercase is far more interesting and would have given the logo more personality. <em>However<\/em>, I do like the contrast of the logo with the headline type in the applications below.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/starlight_childrens_foundation_type.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Starlight Children&amp;apos;s Foundation by Convoy\" \/>\n<figcaption>Typography.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/starlight_childrens_foundation_ad_00.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Starlight Children&amp;apos;s Foundation by Convoy\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/starlight_childrens_foundation_ad_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Starlight Children&amp;apos;s Foundation by Convoy\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/starlight_childrens_foundation_ad_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Starlight Children&amp;apos;s Foundation by Convoy\" \/>\n<figcaption>Applications.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/starlight_childrens_foundation_tote_tee.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Starlight Children&amp;apos;s Foundation by Convoy\" \/>\n<figcaption>Tote and t-shirt.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">The main reason I wanted to highlight this project are the two ad\/poster\/things that show the potential of this identity. There is a great balance achieved in the duotone photographs of kids, the simple uppercase headlines, and the endorsing logo at the bottom. Simple, un-fuzzy, and not over-complicated. I wish their social media was full of this kind of stuff to establish a clear identity or even that their website followed suit but unfortunately, that more nuanced look is nowhere to be seen. Overall, a solid improvement in the logo but the rollout needed probably more commitment from the client or its design\/web partners to bring it to its full potential.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1982, Starlight Children&apos;s Foundation is a nonprofit organization that creates moments of comfort and joy for hospitalized kids and their families in the US, Canada, Australia, and the UK.
