Weve is meant to &#8220;create and accelerate the development of mobile marketing and wallet services&#8221; and provide &#8220;the ability for advertisers, retailers, banks and many other organisations to connect to a large-scale mobile commerce platform via a consistent set of technologies and standards, without having to duplicate effort.&#8221; In other words, as I understand it, it&#8217;s a fancy way of easing the process for the three mobile providers to monetize their platforms. The name is explained in the tagline, &#8220;Weve joined up mobile&#8221;, as in &#8220;we&#8217;ve&#8221; as in &#8220;weve&#8221;. Clever, but a little odd. The new name and identity have been created by London-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.someoneinlondon.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SomeOne<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>Weve offers a single point of contact, a single point of focus. The coming together of all things mobile and mobile commerce. The name and brand reflects this. The duality of the name means that Weve can talk about the partners, and the benefit they offer together. &#8220;Weve come together to make mobile communications easier&hellip;&#8221; as well as the inference of &#8220;weaving together&#8221; what were complex mobile offers.<br \/><br \/>The identity is simply formed by things coming together.Designed to change, frequently, regularly and relevantly. You&#8217;ll see Weve made of mobile phones, people, marbles, digital data, light bulbs, footprints, ball bearings, cogs, clients logos, branded products, faces&hellip;<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.someoneinlondon.com\/category\/projects\/weve-joined-up-mobile\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SomeOne Case Study<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/weve_01.jpg\" alt=\"Weve Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Three existing logo variations, of many to come, featuring marbles, ball bearings, and light bulbs.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/weve_02.jpg\" alt=\"Weve Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/weve_03.jpg\" alt=\"Weve Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/weve_04.jpg\" alt=\"Weve Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Details.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/weve_05.gif\" alt=\"Weve Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Single-color versions.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/weve_06.gif\" alt=\"Weve Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/weve_07.jpg\" alt=\"Weve Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/weve_08.jpg\" alt=\"Weve Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/weve_09.jpg\" alt=\"Weve Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This is a very unexpected identity for what one would expect to turn out as a radically conservative and safe result, given that three well recognized brands are represented through it. The path of least resistance wouldave (see what I did there?) been a gray sans serif wordmark. Instead it&#8217;s a playful, changing identity (still sort of based on a gray sans serif wordmark) rendered in different collections of stuff that support the &#8220;joined up&#8221; tagline. At times, especially with the marbles, the identity looks too playful as if it were for a children&#8217;s or science museum. The ball bearings version does start to look grown-up and techie &mdash; production qualm: I wish they had selected 10 or 15 different ball bearing photos instead of just the one and repeating it all over &mdash; and it&#8217;s perhaps the serif typeface chosen that manages to give everything the business look it needs. In application (as in the website or billboard below) the identity works nicely with a small version of the logo somewhere in a corner and then a blown-up version that allows you to see the detail of it. Overall, it&#8217;s definitely one of those identities that falls under the ambiguous category of &#8220;Interesting&#8221; as it breaks away from the norm and it&#8217;s caught somewhere between WTF and A-OK.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/weve_10.jpg\" alt=\"Weve Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/weve_11.jpg\" alt=\"Weve Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/weve_12.jpg\" alt=\"Weve Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_121031_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_121031_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_121031_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_121031_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[12,26,89],"tags":[179,399,33,302,228],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2191"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2191"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2191\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2191"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2191"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2191"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
