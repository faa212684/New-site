Owned by Darden Restaurants &mdash; which also owns Olive Garden and Longhorn Steakhouse and named after Red Lobster founder Bill Darden &mdash; Red Lobster&#8217;s average sales per restaurant for this past fiscal year was $3.9 million. I haven&#8217;t been to a Red Lobster in more than a decade, but I always remember eating my belly out at that place and the garlic biscuits that they serve while you wait for your food are heavenly. It&#8217;s not 5-star dining, but it&#8217;s very decent, accessible seafood. Last week, Red Lobster debuted a new national TV advertising campaign featuring a new tagline, &#8220;Sea Food Differently&#8221;, (cute!), and a new logo. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.multivu.com\/mnr\/51047-red-lobster-ad-campaign-grey-new-york-sea-food-differently\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press release<\/a> credits <a href=\"http:\/\/www.greyny.com\/newyork\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Grey New York<\/a> for the overall campaign, not certain if they did the logo as well. Red Lobster will also be updating all of its new locations to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.redlobster.com\/bar_harbor\/gallery.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bar Harbor design<\/a>, &#8220;inspired by the New England coast.&#8221;<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/red_lobster_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"Red Lobster\" \/><\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"573\" height=\"326\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/ySl03vqdKNQ?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">One of two new TV spots.

They each have their cons and they each, well, don&#8217;t have many real pros to speak of with conviction. But let&#8217;s try. The previous lobster was much better, it felt like something you would find, or at least imagine to find, in &#8220;the New England Coast&#8221; as Red Lobster is trying to mimic. It had that vintage, woodcut texture to it that never fails to make people hungry. Sure, probably a pain in the ass to reproduce but surely there could have been room for a professional illustrator to update the lobster to retain that effect with more flexibility for reproduction, instead of getting the new latex-covered lobster. Seriously, I&#8217;ve never seen a lobster so shiny or smooth. The typography in the new logo is a slight improvement over the old but that&#8217;s simply because condensed bold serifs don&#8217;t rock my world and because it&#8217;s not the 1980s anymore. There is a second tag line, &#8220;Fresh Fish, Live Lobster&#8221;, that someone jammed into the bottom of the lock-up, either as an afterthought or as a display of lack of proportion and spacing awareness. I liked the old framing device better, even though it was slightly ambiguous. The new rounded-corner rectangle is fairly boring. Overall, it feels like an update that makes sense and Red Lobster feels more contemporary but it&#8217;s quite middle-of-the-road logo design. Put a garlic biscuit on it though and I&#8217;d be sold.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to Umar Shahzad for first tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_110801_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_110801_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"285\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_110801_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_110801_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"285\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_110801_config_03.xml&#038;xyz=poll_110801_votes_03.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"285\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv3\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv3\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,85,26],"tags":[230,256,33],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1563"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1563"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1563\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1563"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1563"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1563"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
