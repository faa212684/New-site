Like the other Grand Tours (the Giro d&#8217;Italia and the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a), it consists of 21 day-long stages over the course of 23 days. It &#8216;is the world&#8217;s most prestigious and most difficult bicycle race&#8217;. Traditionally, the race is held primarily in the month of July. While the route changes each year, the format of the race stays the same with the appearance of time trials, the passage through the mountain chains of the Pyrenees and the Alps, and the finish on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in Paris. The modern editions of the Tour de France consist of 21 day-long segments (stages) over a 23-day period and cover around 3,500 kilometres (2,200 mi). The race alternates between clockwise and counterclockwise circuits of France.&#8221; (<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tour_de_France\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wikipedia<\/a>)<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tour_de_france_logo_before_after_overlaid_a.png\" alt=\"New Logo for Tour de France\" \/>\n<figcaption>Before and after weirdly overlaid but helps see the differences.
