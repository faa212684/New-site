Their plates, lunch boxes, dessert and soup bowls, cutlery, trays, and carrier bags are all comparable in price to plastic versions, come in a variety of colors, and will biodegrade after 90 days. Earlier this year, Cornware introduced a new logo and identity designed by Budapest, Hungary-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dekoratio.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DekoRatio<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cornware_old_logo_product.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Cornware by DekoRatio\" \/>\n<figcaption>Old logo on product.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>Our task was to create an iconic, cool and sexy identity for the brand, including a characteristic and memorable symbol for CornWare that people can relate to and can immediately recognize on products. In order to achieve this goal, we used bright colors, instead of the way too familiar sand, gray and green colors that are commonly used by recycling brands. As for the logo, we chose the butterfly, as it represents rejuvenation and it is also a symbol that is easy to remember. The typo is made up of bold letters so it can stand out and can be recognized even when  they are printed small on the plates.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/41301679\/Cornware\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DekoRatio project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cornware_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Cornware by DekoRatio\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cornware_logo_construction.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo construction.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo, OMG, you guys! To say that it came from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fiverr.com\/categories\/graphics-design\/creative-logo-design\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fiverr<\/a> would be an insult to many of those $5-logos. Petty sarcasm aside, the logo <em>was<\/em> unfortunate and in no way communicated that there was an innovative material behind it nor that its products actually looked good, contemporary, or even <a href=\"http:\/\/cornware.co.uk\/product\/pink-prozen-yogurt-spoons-1000pcs\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">stylish<\/a>. The new logo is a much needed and very much on target evolution with a cool, abstract rendering of a butterfly and not-completely-geometric sans serif. This new combination may not scream &#8220;Biodegradable plates!&#8221; but at least hints at a company doing something simple and bold that somehow has to do with corn and butterflies &#8212; butterflies in the sense of caring about nature &#8212; which is much better than the wedding invitation vibe of the old logo.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cornware_icons.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Cornware by DekoRatio\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icons.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cornware_products.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Cornware by DekoRatio\" \/>\n<figcaption>Products.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cornware_box_colors.mov\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Color variations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cornware_brochure_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Cornware by DekoRatio\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cornware_brochure_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Cornware by DekoRatio\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cornware_brochure_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Cornware by DekoRatio\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brochure.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>What I like about this project more than the logo is how they have &#8220;activated&#8221; their products to be almost exciting. The silhouetted products with the names around them give the plates, cups, and cutlery their rock-star moment and that&#8217;s hard to do with corn-and-yam-made plates, cups, and cutlery. The product brochure is also the most exciting disposable tableware brochure you&#8217;ll probably ever see. It&#8217;s not that it&#8217;s the most fantastic piece of graphic design but it makes a dull product look interesting and, more importantly, it makes it look as if the company behind it is excited and cares about how they present it.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cornware_business_card.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Cornware by DekoRatio\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cornware_business_card_backs.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Cornware by DekoRatio\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cornware_letterhead_bottoms.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Cornware by DekoRatio\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cornware_letterhead.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Cornware by DekoRatio\" \/>\n<figcaption>Letterhead.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">The business cards and letterhead introduce a strip with basically a tag-cloud of words associated with what they do; somehow this could be cooler because, as it is, it has a very old-fashioned 1990s look to it.
