Raleigh is the second largest city in the state of North Carolina, behind only Charlotte. Raleigh is known as the &#8220;City of Oaks&#8221; for its many oak trees, which line the streets in the heart of the city. The city covers a land area of 142.8 square miles (370 km2). The U.S. Census Bureau estimated the city&#8217;s population as 451,066 as of July 1, 2015. It is one of the fastest-growing cities in the country. The city of Raleigh is named after Sir Walter Raleigh, who established the lost Roanoke Colony in present-day Dare County. Following the establishment of the Research Triangle Park in 1959, numerous jobs were created in science and technology. The region and city have attracted a large influx of population, making it one of the fastest growing communities in the United States by the early 21st century.&#8221; (<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Raleigh,_North_Carolina\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wikipedia<\/a>)<\/p><!--more--><figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/city_of_raleigh_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo for City of Raleigh by The Assembly\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/nAj7u8g04DU\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo presentation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/aiONB1JcezU\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Brand application exploration<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"&quot;Raleigh is the capital of the state of North Carolina and the seat of Wake County in the United States.
