Last month, Nixon Peabody introduced a new identity designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wolffolins.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wolff Olins<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nixon_peabody_workshops.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Nixon Peabody by Wolff Olins\" \/>\n<figcaption>Workshops and process.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>Our new logo signals our intent&#8211;a dynamic &#8220;spark&#8221; that symbolizes both our innovative ideas and actions and the collective intelligence of the whole firm thinking ahead for our clients.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nixonpeabody.com\/our_promise\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nixon Peabody promise page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nixon_peabody_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Nixon Peabody by Wolff Olins\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail and alternate colors.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nixon_peabody_applications_typeface.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Nixon Peabody by Wolff Olins\" \/>\n<figcaption>Custom typeface.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>It goes without saying that the old logo was as boring as we think most law firms and their logos are &mdash; &#8220;Optima FTW&#8221; is something lawyers must say every time they think of logo design but has rarely been uttered by a graphic designer. The new logo is <em>anything<\/em> but Optima and breaks with almost every traditional aspect of designing identities for law firms: it&#8217;s bright and colorful, it uses a condensed and contemporary sans serif, and its icon is abstract. Abstract. For lawyers, &#8220;abstract&#8221; is like daylight to vampires. With room for interpretation, the new icon is described as a &#8220;spark&#8221;, which is as good an explanation as any. It&#8217;s not terribly attractive but it certainly is different and attention-grabbing for the law industry so more than being a significantly significant logo I feel it&#8217;s meant to be a bold way to stand out from the competition and establish NP as being the one law firm willing to break with tradition and move forward.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nixon_peabody_applications_stationery.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Nixon Peabody by Wolff Olins\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stationery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nixon_peabody_applications_numbers.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Nixon Peabody by Wolff Olins\" \/>\n<figcaption>Facts and figures.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nixon_peabody_applications_pitchbook.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Nixon Peabody by Wolff Olins\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brochure.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/yH12etGIWh8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Firm introduction and their promise.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">In application, the identity maintains the attitude of the logo with big and bright visual statements starting with their <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nixonpeabody.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">website<\/a>, which looks like no other law firm website I&#8217;ve seen recently. It&#8217;s remarkably refreshing but at the same time you do have to wonder how many old-school CEO clients wouldn&#8217;t be turned off by the equivalent of kids playing on a lawn?
