From clothing kits to self-care essentials. That way, you can leave a little more space upstairs for wondering&#8230; pondering&#8230; thinking about your ideas. Bscly, busy minds need simple things. We began with one universal outfit, sustainably and simply designed to go everywhere your ideas take you. Each kit comes in an earth-friendly sugarcane* box.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>* &#8220;Sugarcane is biodegradable, compostable and eco-friendly. It&#8217;s harvested and regrows, fully, every year, capturing more CO2 from the atmosphere. Because it regenerates, it&#8217;s a renewable material that will never run out. Sugarcane also does this really cool thing where it helps bring nutrients back to the soil it&#8217;s planted on, even depleted pastureland. It&#8217;s a material that goes beyond not doing harm&#8211;it actually does some good.&#8221;<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bscly_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for bscly done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bscly_the_kit.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for bscly done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>The kit.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bscly_box_00.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for bscly done In-house\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bscly_box_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for bscly done In-house\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bscly_box_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for bscly done In-house\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bscly_box_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for bscly done In-house\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bscly_box_04.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for bscly done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>The box.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bscly_bag_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for bscly done In-house\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bscly_bag_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for bscly done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>The bag.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"(Est. 2019) &quot;Bscly makes products that simplify the little distracting things in life.
