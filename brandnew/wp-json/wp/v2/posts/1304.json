THQ produces its own original titles and also holds exclusive licenses to develop titles for World Wrestling Entertainment and Ultimate Fighting Championship, making it popular with the beat-&rsquo;em-up, shoot-&rsquo;em-up crowd. Gamers and the industry alike have all taken notice of THQ&#8217;s change over the years from what Kotaku calls having &#8220;a licensed-schlock publishing reputation&#8221; to &#8220;one of quality-focused &#8216;transmedia&#8217; brand builder.&#8221; Or CVG who considered THQ as &#8220;Unreliable, uninspiring&hellip; unexciting&#8221; but acknowledges that &#8220;in the last 18 months it&#8217;s clear something&#8217;s very different at the firm.&#8221; And that <em>something<\/em> is now signaled by a new logo, introduced yesterday at the New York Gamers Event.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>&#8220;Our new logo epitomizes the change, innovation and creative growth that are the cornerstones of the new THQ,&#8221;said Brian Farrell, THQ President and CEO. &#8220;By developing triple-A, innovative, original intellectual properties, attracting the top talent in the industry, and placing that talent first, THQ continues to redefine itself. This new logo seeks to capture that change and make it tangible.&#8221;<br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/investor.thq.com\/phoenix.zhtml?c=96376&#038;p=irol-newsArticle&#038;ID=1515518&#038;highlight=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press Release<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/thq_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"THQ Logo, Detail\"><\/p>\n<p>The previous logo was awkward but in that endearing-1990s-videogame way with quirky, techie features. The new one still shares some of that awkwardness but it does so in a simpler, bolder, and even more sophisticated (relatively speaking) way. The contrast of the first two 90-degree-angle-driven characters (&#8220;TH&#8221;) offset the round &#8220;Q&#8221; quite nicely. I&#8217;m not exactly quite sure what&#8217;s going in with the &#8220;H&#8221; if it&#8217;s supposed to be a lowercase &#8220;h&#8221; backwards, or if it&#8217;s an uppercase &#8220;H&#8221; with the top-left stem being cut off in a fill-it-on-your-own-Gestalt way. (Sorry for all the hyphenations in this post, not-sure-what&#8217;s-up-with-that). And I&#8217;m also not sure the &#8220;Q&#8221; is visually resolved in the best manner &mdash; the way it flares up on the right side is not pretty. But as a whole it is a bold improvement over the previous one.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to Regi Jacob for first tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_110113_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_110113_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"574\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[66,12,26],"tags":[42,112],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1304"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1304"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1304\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1304"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1304"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1304"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
