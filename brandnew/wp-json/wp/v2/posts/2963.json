The logo for Lumburr Co is a lovely piece of line work that would make Wes Anderson swoon. Yes, it has the airs of hipster design, but this is very well done &mdash; it has a minimal amount of strokes and angles (birds and water are the same shapes!) &mdash; and perfectly suited for the products they aim to sell. Plus, not enough logos are burned into wood if you ask me. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/Lumbuerr-co\/12442779\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Rebecca Books by Inhouse<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_rebeccabooks.jpg\" alt=\"Rebecca Books by Inhouse\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">Located in Auckland, New Zealand, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rebeccabooks.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rebecca Books<\/a> specializes in artist books and publications and has a deceptively simple-looking logo that is surprisingly constructed. Designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.inhousedesign.co.nz\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Inhouse<\/a>, it doesn&#8217;t yield a groundbreaking logo or identity, but it&#8217;s a keen structure for a subtle wordmark. The other aspect of the identity are dots, lots and lots of dots that manage to look cool in their abundance and generous size and spacing. <a href=\"http:\/\/bestawards.co.nz\/entries\/graphic\/category\/identity-development-small-scale\/rebecca-books\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">2013 UTS Grad Show by Olivia King and Sebastian Andreassen<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_uts.jpg\" alt=\"2013 UTS Grad Show by Olivia King and Sebastian Andreassen\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">With increasingly ambitious identity programs for senior student grad shows around the world it&#8217;s nice to see some of those efforts rising to the top, like the <a href=\"http:\/\/viscomgradshow.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2013 UTS Visual Communications Grad Show<\/a> from the most recent crop of design students from University of Technology, Sydney. Designed by Olivia King and Sebastian Andreassen, the identity and tone of voice is based on a combination of their school&#8217;s acronym (UTS), the year 2013, and working your butt off. Lo and behold, the result is &#8220;2013 Butts: Design.&#8221; The 3 becomes the butt of the joke and if you don&#8217;t get it, there are also implied paintings of butt cheeks and risky double-entendres like &#8220;Come get behind us&#8221;. The materials are done with humor and the lively split fountain gradient conveys the brisk, youthful optimism of these grads. <a href=\"http:\/\/oliviaking.com\/gradshow.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"A little bit of everything today on Friday Likes but with a particular bent towards hipster-ish design &mdash; the good kind! &mdash; with work from Toronto, Auckland, and Sydney&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[989,579,873],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2963"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2963"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2963\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2963"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2963"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2963"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
