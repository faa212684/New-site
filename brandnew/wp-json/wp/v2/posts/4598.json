Categories include websites, advertising and media, online film and video, mobile sites and apps, and social. Two winners are selected in each category, one by members of The International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences, and one by the public who cast their votes during Webby People&#8217;s Voice voting. Each winner presents a five-word acceptance speech, a trademark of the annual awards show. Hailed as the &#8220;Internet&#8217;s highest honor,&#8221; the award is one of the older internet-oriented awards, and is associated with the phrase &#8220;The Oscars of the Internet.&#8221; (<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Webby_Award\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wikipedia<\/a>)<\/p><!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_webby_awards_logo_evolution.png\" alt=\"APRIL FOOLS: New Logo and Identity for The Webby Awards done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Evolution over the years.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_webby_awards_logo.png\" alt=\"APRIL FOOLS: New Logo and Identity for The Webby Awards done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_webby_awards_logo_grid.png\" alt=\"APRIL FOOLS: New Logo and Identity for The Webby Awards done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Underlying grid.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_webby_awards_business_card.jpg\" alt=\"APRIL FOOLS: New Logo and Identity for The Webby Awards done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business card.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_webby_awards_tote.jpg\" alt=\"APRIL FOOLS: New Logo and Identity for The Webby Awards done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Tote.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"(Est. 1996) &quot;A Webby Award is an award for excellence on the Internet presented annually by The International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences, a judging body composed of over one thousand industry experts and technology innovators.
