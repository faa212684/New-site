In December they introduced the new new name and identity created and designed, respectively, by Mexico City-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ideograma.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ideograma<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>We created Aprecia, a sympathetic, positive and memorable name that is also a verb, a call to action for its employees and a statement of value to their clients. Its conjugation can be read with three messages: &#8220;It &mdash; the company &mdash; appreciates you&#8221;, as a value proposition of the brand; &#8220;You, appreciate&#8221;, as invitation or imperative to appreciate things better; and &#8220;seek to appreciate the value of things, generate wealth&#8221; as a partnership between the customer and the company. The brand does not require slogan, it is the slogan.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/media\/set\/?set=a.10152207671328688.1073741838.98438398687&#038;type=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ideograma project on Facebook<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/aprecia_financiera_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Aprecia by Ideograma\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The graphical solution is simple but, in turn, full of meanings: The star serves as a guide to achieve the dreams, while opening its arms in welcome and support. From inside opens a door that invites us to discover new opportunities to advance and improve our lives. This growth is evoked by the ascending steps that take us higher. Their bright colors project life, hope and joy, while the typography is harmonious with the soft and friendly features of the symbol.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/media\/set\/?set=a.10152207671328688.1073741838.98438398687&#038;type=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ideograma project on Facebook<\/a><\/h3>\n<p>The old logo was excruciating, with the &#8220;F&#8221; and &#8220;E&#8221; performing typographic intercourse with the letters to their sides and the abstract human figure doing jumping jacks next to a rainbow. The name, an acronym for something I can&#8217;t find the original meaning for, wasn&#8217;t too inviting either. The new name is remarkably friendly and easy to use in conversation as a name for a company. You&#8217;ll have to trust me on that one since &#8220;Appreciate&#8221;, as a company name in English, admittedly sounds terrible &mdash; &#8220;Aprecia&#8221; works in Spanish. But what attracted me to this project in the first place was the logo.<\/p>\n<p>I love it. It has far more volume, dimension, and depth &mdash; I know those three things are basically the same &mdash; than any number of gradients, bevels, or shadows have achieved for other logos. The angle of the star, the limited view of the stairs, the purple color serving as the shading in the steps&hellip; it&#8217;s just very well done. The soft execution in the icon leads perfectly well to the wordmark, where we finally see rounded-corner typography that makes sense and works in tandem with the icon.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/aprecia_financiera_signage.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Aprecia by Ideograma\" \/>\n<figcaption>Signage.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/aprecia_financiera_brochures.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Aprecia by Ideograma\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brochures.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/aprecia_financiera_letterhead.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Aprecia by Ideograma\" \/>\n<figcaption>Letterhead.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/aprecia_financiera_binders.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Aprecia by Ideograma\" \/>\n<figcaption>Binders.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/aprecia_financiera_umbrella.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Aprecia by Ideograma\" \/>\n<figcaption>Umbrella.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">The rest of the identity and application are not that interesting &mdash; it&#8217;s fine, don&#8217;t get me wrong, and I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s a vast improvement over whatever Fomepade-ish materials existed before. Nonetheless, what makes the logo, identity, and application work is that the company HAS to come across as friendly and accessible to an audience that is either weary or scared about financial institutions and loans. From the name to the blue-starred background, Aprecia looks and feels like a company that won&#8217;t screw you over. In Mexico, that&#8217;s a big bonus.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Formerly known as Fomepade and previously specialized in financial loans and credits to government employees, Aprecia (&quot;appreciate&quot;) is a loan company in Mexico with retail locations in sixteen states now focused on low-income workers in any industry by offering loans&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,37,26],"tags":[261,476,172,586,530],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3162"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3162"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3162\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3162"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3162"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3162"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
