Earlier this month, SF introduced a new logo designed by Los Angeles-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.72andsunny.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">72andSunny<\/a>. <\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/surfrider_foundation_map.gif\" alt=\"Surfrider Foundation\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Not identity related, but I just love how the chapters dot the coasts. I guess if there was a Pasture Foundation they would have the inverse map.<\/p>\n<blockquote>&#8220;We wanted to build from Surfrider&#8217;s heritage and infuse it with the idea of growth through activism. Both the wordmark and icon swell, becoming bolder over time,&#8221; said John Boiler, co-founder, 72andSunny. <br \/><br \/>Surfrider Foundation&#8217;s new logo maintains many familiar elements from the original mark, including the organization&#8217;s famous stripped wave, albeit in a more streamlined and contemporary design.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.surfline.com\/surf-news\/press-release\/surfrider-foundation-unveils-new-logo_46207\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press Release<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p>This change is like going from surfing in Hawaii to your grandma&#8217;s tub: All the energy and dynamism the previous icon had has gone awash in the new one. By being confined in a square, the old wave conveyed a sense of the grandiosity a good wave can reach, completely engulfing you. I am sure someone, somewhere had a hard time reproducing the logo on a t-shirt or wetsuit and said they needed to change to something more simple and Nike-like. The new icon is weak not just in its sloppy execution but also in its depiction of a wave. It has no energy or power. The typography is a bit of a clich&eacute; but it could have been saved by better execution and a more interesting choice than all the weights of Helvetica Neue &mdash; just as one alternative, take different weights and widths of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fontbureau.com\/fonts\/TitlingGothicFB\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Titling Gothic<\/a> and go to town or, to ocean, with it. There was no need to change the old logo so drastically; drawing one or two versions of it with less and more spaced lines for small reproduction and replacing that funky italic would have been sufficient.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"red_100\">Update, March 27, 2014:<\/span><\/strong> The very first logo comparison image in this post has been updated with the newest version of Surfrider Foundation&#8217;s logo, making the text directly above not make total sense. The original image as it appeared in the review is posted below. The switch was made due to the outdated logo appearing in Google&#8217;s image search results causing confusion to the Foundation&#8217;s partners, sponsors, etc..<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/surfrider_foundation_logo_original.gif\" alt=\"Surfrider Foundation Logo, Before and After\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/www. bradydahmer.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Elizabeth Macdonald<\/a> for firs tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_100827a_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_100827a_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_100827a_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_100827a_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,79,26],"tags":[310,292,195,105,42],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1182"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1182"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1182\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1182"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1182"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1182"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
