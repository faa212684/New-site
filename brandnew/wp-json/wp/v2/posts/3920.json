Produced by parent company Diamond Foods, Emerald Nuts hit a period of growth in 2007, in part thanks to its Superbowl ad <a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/nMMDSEX_sNo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">featuring a mischievous Robert Goulet<\/a> and is now sold nationwide at major retailers like Target and Walmart. With the recent introduction of resealable bag packaging, Emerald Nuts adopted a new logo and identity designed by Seattle, WA-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.girvin.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GIRVIN<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"red_100\"><strong>Update 4\/23\/15:<\/strong> Unfortunately, the design firm has gotten all weird about the positive attention and requested that the cool photos and typography images be taken down. Post will remain up for archival purposes.<\/span><\/p><!--more--><figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/emerald_nuts_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Emerald Nuts by GIRVIN\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The previous logo looked almost like it belonged on a bottle of rum. Or the grill of an Italian car. Neither reference is bad, so it&#8217;s not a complete negative criticism. The gold-plated stroke, though, was a little much and the typography went from fine in the &#8220;R&#8221; to very weird as it blended with the oblong shape. The new logo is much more modern by removing the gold stroke, leveling the top, and going with a sharper, chevron-like holding the shape, making it easier to adapt the letterforms in the wordmark. The letters look sharp and strong and I really like how the stem of the &#8220;R&#8221; falls right in the middle. Even the tricky kerning with the &#8220;A&#8221; has been well resolved. The resulting logo looks fresher and while it may also look great on a bottle of motor oil I don&#8217;t mind on the outside of some nuts.<\/p>\n<p>The pattern is a playful rendition of how <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=emerald&#038;es_sm=91&#038;source=lnms&#038;tbm=isch&#038;sa=X&#038;ei=4Ck2VaKvD4aYsAXVhYDwCg&#038;ved=0CAcQ_AUoAQ&#038;biw=1115&#038;bih=857\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cut emeralds look<\/a>, making for a great visual element to use over and over while still seeming different in each use.<\/p>\n<p>The custom type is okay, I would have also accepted <a href=\"https:\/\/www.myfonts.com\/fonts\/linotype\/alternate-gothic-lt\/?refby=ucllc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Alternate Gothic<\/a> as a solution.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/emerald_nuts_old_lineup.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Emerald Nuts by GIRVIN\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sample of old packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/emerald_nuts_packaging.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Emerald Nuts by GIRVIN\" \/>\n<figcaption>Packaging, before and after.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The previous packaging had a duty-free airport look that tried to be upscale but really wasn&#8217;t. (Again, the fault of that golden stroke). The typography on it was all over the place too, with an overly expressive and swashy serif and some unfortunate hand-brushy type for the flavors. The new bags have a giant logo bleeding off the top, making them extra visible on the shelf and from there the pattern flows down with the obligatory real product shot and ends with a different colored pattern and some more engaging typography for the flavors and styles.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/emerald_nuts_packaging_detail_extra.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Emerald Nuts by GIRVIN\" \/>\n<figcaption>Packaging detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/emerald_nuts_lineup.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Emerald Nuts by GIRVIN\" \/>\n<figcaption>Some more variations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">The new look is really great; it makes Emerald Nuts feel more like a power snack &mdash; which nuts are anyway &mdash; and it&#8217;s a much more distinctive and unique design than other generic mainstream snack packaging.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"First sold in 2004, Emerald Nuts is a line of nut snacks offering almonds, cashews, pecans, and walnuts in a variety of presentations and flavorings &mdash; from trail mixes to cocoa roasted almonds to sweet and salty mixes.
