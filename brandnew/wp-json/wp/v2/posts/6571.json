Sharon first discovered the power of bone broth when treating her son Blake&#8217;s chronic illness and inspired by this journey, she started a private nutrition practice. Bone broth was key to her treatment plan but her patients were reluctant to make their own. So she convinced her chef-husband Reb to craft a recipe with ingredients she carefully chose and a preparation method she could stand behind. Our broth is made from bones &#8211; not meat &#8211; and is slow-simmered for 24 hours and fresh-frozen after cooking just like you would do at home. Originally prepared for Sharon&#8217;s clients, our small batch organic bone broth is now available to all.&#8221;<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bonafide_provisions_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Bonafide Provisions by Bex Brands\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bonafide_provisions_packaging_broth_old.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Bonafide Provisions by Bex Brands\" \/>\n<figcaption>OLD broth packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bonafide_provisions_packaging_broth.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Bonafide Provisions by Bex Brands\" \/>\n<figcaption>Broth.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bonafide_provisions_packaging_before_after.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Bonafide Provisions by Bex Brands\" \/>\n<figcaption>Drinkable veggies packaging, before and after.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bonafide_provisions_packaging_bottles.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Bonafide Provisions by Bex Brands\" \/>\n<figcaption>Drinkable veggies.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bonafide_provisions_packaging_soups.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Bonafide Provisions by Bex Brands\" \/>\n<figcaption>Soups.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"&quot;Bonafide Provisions was founded in 2011 when Sharon Brown, a clinical nutritionist and certified GAPS practitioner, could not find a bone broth that met her standards.
