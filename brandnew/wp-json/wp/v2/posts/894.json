I do know I would like to visit it. But I also know that it wouldn&#8217;t be because of a new marketing logo <a href=\"http:\/\/www.duvalguillaume.com\/news\/2009\/ghent-citymarketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">designed by the corporate branding division of Duval Guillaume<\/a>.<\/p><!--more-->\n<p>Oh, don&#8217;t get me wrong, I really like the new logo and I will go into that shortly. But, again, from my limited exposure (i.e., this morning&#8217;s searches) there seems to be a disconnect <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/search\/?q=gent&#038;w=all\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">from the images I see<\/a> and the overt attempt of the logo to be so very contemporary. From the logo and identity I get the sense that Gent is at the verge of becoming the next unknown technological or business hub of Europe or a financial center in the making. Yet I have a hard time making that connection. So, pending any insight from our Belgian readers (I know you are out there!) I will assume that there is indeed a need to portray Gent as a contemporary city.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/gent_logo_variations.gif\" alt=\"Gent Logo, Variations\" \/><\/p>\n<div class=\"caption\">Variations in theme within the logo.<\/div>\n<p>The logo is a nice device that can hold multiple messages without missing a beat. The word is so short and has a great combination of letters that makes it look really sharp by default, but the selection of the typeface, with its hard angles and quirky notches, really helps make it a great-looking logo. The theme of the campaign is &#8220;Ghent: So Much City&#8221; which is ambitious but it works. The logo can take on a number of colors and themes and in a somewhat corny visual move, the colon can be different things like flowers or apples. It&#8217;s a nice overall effect of flexibility.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/gent_configuration.gif\" alt=\"Gent Logo, Configuration\" \/><\/p>\n<div class=\"caption\">Configuring the logo with additional messages.<\/div>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/gent_ads.jpg\" alt=\"Gent Logo, Advertising\" \/><\/p>\n<div class=\"caption\">Samples of advertising.<\/div>\n<p>There is a very nice and comprehensive <a href=\"http:\/\/www.news-from-duvalguillaume.com\/gent\/styleguide\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">style guide online<\/a> that shows the different applications and rules, including one about the logo always having its subtle drop shadow and prohibiting the use of the logo without it. This is overall a pretty good identity system for Gent.<\/p>\n<h4>Thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/lodev.name\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lode Vermeiren<\/a> for the tip.<br \/><br \/><\/h4>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_20090731_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_20090731_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_20090731_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_20090731_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,64,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/894"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=894"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/894\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=894"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=894"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=894"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
