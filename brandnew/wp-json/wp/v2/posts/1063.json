Controlled by media giant Globo (the 3rd biggest privately owned broadcaster in the world, after CBS and NBC and whose logo <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/around_the_globe_since_the_six.php\">was previously reviewed on Brand New<\/a>), NET began as a cable TV provider in 1991, to later offer also internet access and VoIP services. Recently, a new NET logo was released, with almost no noise about it &mdash; perhaps a symptom of the overall neglect that logo design is still treated with in Brazil.<\/p><!--more--><p>In an attempt to make the logo more contemporary, the internal team that took the job seems to have gone for the general &#8220;contemporize&#8221; formula: they maintained the overall concept of the logo, lost the arched effect and gradient (sticking with the lighter colour), set the three-striped &#8220;E&#8221; proportion to the 16:9 widescreen standard (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mtv_more_tv_less_m.php\">like MTV<\/a>), gave the &#8220;N&#8221; and &#8220;T&#8221; some round corners and set the whole thing in a slightly lighter stroke.<\/p>\n<p>The former logo had something of a &#8220;curvature of the world&#8221; shape, probably reminiscent of the &#8220;we are so very much global indeed&#8221; era of logos (and also of its owner&#8217;s name, Globo). In the new one, the rectangle shape, the 16:9 proportion of the &#8220;E&#8221; and the perspective with a vanishing point at the center, seem to evoke a screen projection cone, thus taking the logo away from the &#8220;we are global&#8221; approach to something more aggressive and less idealistic like &#8220;we shoot images made out of light into your eyes.&#8221;\n<p>Although I understand that the old logo did need some facelifting, I can&#8217;t help but feel that the new one is poorly executed. The &#8220;E&#8221; bothers me. When mixing parallel lines and arches so closely together, one should pay attention to some basic &#8220;gestalt&#8221; principles. The effect is awkward, not so beautiful and in smaller sizes or on screen, seems more like a defect. I also see a small kerning problem: Checking the logo on my latest cable bills, the distance between the &#8220;E&#8221; and the &#8220;T&#8221; seems to be identical to that of the &#8220;N&#8221; and the &#8220;E&#8221;, when, given the empty space under the &#8220;T,&#8221; it should be smaller, to balance the counterforms.<\/p>\n<p>Regarding the concept, it&#8217;s interesting to note that when idealized, the former logo used the stripes of the &#8220;E&#8221; just to evoke interconnection. But as the company widened their scope to provide internet access and VoIP too, the three stripes became also an appropriate analogy for their three-product combo.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to Guilherme Appolin&aacute;rio for the tip.<\/p>\n<div class=\"bottom\">Dado Queiroz is a <a href=\"http:\/\/dadoqueiroz.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">graphic<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/new.myfonts.com\/foundry\/estudioCrop\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">type<\/a> designer in Sao Paulo, Brazil.
