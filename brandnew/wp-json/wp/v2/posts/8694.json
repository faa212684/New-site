The packaging, designed by S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil-based <a href=\"http:\/\/pharusdesign.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pharus<\/a>, manages to break with most of the design conventions for mainstream consumer packaging, from the shape and hard angle of the label, to the serif typography in black, to, well, the overall sophistication. There  are a lot of great details in that label and I feel like all of them could have easily been tacky-fied by Coca-Cola with shadows and fake droplets of water and random squiggles but it all made it unscathed, even the slightly cropped names of the products. The colors of the product themselves also help a great deal in making this a lovely family of products to look at. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/93663869\/Schweppes-Premium-Drinks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Yaourti by TUX Creative Co.<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_yaourti.jpg\" alt=\"Yaourti by TUX Creative Co.\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.yaourti.ca\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Yaourti<\/a> is a fast-casual restaurant in Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec, serving Mediterranean dishes with the twist that they all revolve around the owners&#8217; love (and recipe) for Greek yogurt so the salads come with Greek yogurt dressing, the sandwiches with Greek yogurt spread, the bowls with Greek yogurt dollops, and the smoothies with, you guessed it, Greek yogurt. The identity, designed by local firm <a href=\"https:\/\/tux.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TUX Creative Co.<\/a>, adds its own Greek flavor by &#8220;reinterpreting some key aspects, such as the iconic ancient arches and certain Hellenic forms&#8221; that result in an endlessly endearing wordmark that is all kinds of funky and full of personality. There is a little bit of an unbalance with the &#8220;a&#8221; being so commanding, especially in contrast with the &#8220;Y&#8221;, but I&#8217;m fine overlooking it just because it&#8217;s such a free-spirited wordmark &#8212; and this coming from someone who hates unicase. The identity adds some original dingbats that are equally funky and add up to a very unique aesthetic. Bonus points for the color palette NOT being blue and white, like every other Greek restaurant or product. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/93363045\/Yaourti\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Bean to Bar by Zoo Studio<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_beantobar.jpg\" alt=\"Bean to Bar by Zoo Studio\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/museudelaxocolata.cat\/categories\/bean-to-bar\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bean to Bar<\/a> is a range of chocolates created and sold by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.museuxocolata.cat\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">El Museu de la Xocolata de Barcelona<\/a> (The Chocolate Museum of Barcelona) that includes six types of chocolate, each from a different region of the world and are produced as artisanal-y as possible. The packaging, designed by local firm <a href=\"https:\/\/zoo.ad\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Zoo Studio<\/a>, is, literally, a bundle of goodness. Each bar comes with a mini brochure presented as staggered pages secured by a copper-colored thread that matches the visible foil covering. Bold typography and dense layouts, paired with rich photography, make for a great complement to the minimal chocolate bar inside and hint at what I&#8217;m guessing is an explosion of flavor when you dig into it. The chocolate also comes in some kraft paper pouches with equally great typography, looking like something straight from another era. Bean to bar to my belly, please. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/zoo.ad\/project\/bean-to-bar-museu-de-la-xocolata-de-barcelona\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"No minimalism this week, with work from S\u00e3o Paulo, Montr\u00e9al, and Barcelona&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[51,11,85,26],"tags":[790,146,882,1605,909,1107],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8694"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=8694"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8694\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=8694"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=8694"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=8694"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
