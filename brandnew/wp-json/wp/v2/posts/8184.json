Last week, Reebok re-introduced its &#8220;vector&#8221; logo and new identity designed in collaboration by their in-house team and New York, NY-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dcrsnz.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Darrin Crescenzi<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>Today, Reebok announced that\u00a0beginning in 2020,\u00a0it will unify under one brand logo and wordmark, leveraging its most recognizable and distinguished\u00a0assets &#8211;\u00a0the Vector\u00a0logo\u00a0and &#8220;drop-R&#8221; wordmark.<br \/><br \/>The\u00a0wordmark\u00a0and logo\u00a0will be fully integrated across all Reebok sport and lifestyle products, including footwear and apparel, while an exclusive early release of sport styles\u00a0featuring the Vector\u00a0logo\u00a0will be available this month.

Its more &#8220;hardcore&#8221; look helped signal a new personality for the brand and establish some distance with Nike and even parent brand Adidas. As <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/new_logo_for_reebok.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">in my 2014 review of that change<\/a>, five years later, I still don&#8217;t find the Delta icon particularly great but I think it worked well to propel Reebok forward. The old wordmark was fine and had some subtle personality to it but nothing that will be missed.<\/p>\n<p>The new logo is a return to the 1990s logo and the closest Reebok has had to an equivalent of Nike&#8217;s swoosh or Adidas&#8217; three stripes. The dynamic &#8220;Vector&#8221; icon has been cleaned up for another go-round and the changes are all improvements, especially making the top and bottom flat for crisper placement and alignment with other elements or simply for being on its own. To me, the most exciting part is the return of the wordmark in one of the most 1980s-tastic fonts of all, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/motter_fuc.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Motter Tektura<\/a>. I know I speak more from nostalgia than any other relevant cognitive function but I really like that wordmark and the opening up of its spacing makes a huge, positive difference. I also like the return of the blue to replace the black as it provides a softer look and a color palette that supports Reebok&#8217;s &#8220;American-inspired&#8221; positioning.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/reebok_2019_shoeboxes.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Reebok done In-house with Darrin Crescenzi\" \/>\n<figcaption>Shoe boxes.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/reebok_2019_hangtags.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Reebok done In-house with Darrin Crescenzi\" \/>\n<figcaption>Hang tags.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/reebok_2019_shopping_bag.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Reebok done In-house with Darrin Crescenzi\" \/>\n<figcaption>Shopping bags.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The few applications shown above are pretty nice, with a hint of retro-ness to them that can potentially have the effect of older consumers falling back in love with Reebok and maybe young consumers finding it as curious as vinyl records to give it a go.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/reebok_2019_embroidered.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Reebok done In-house with Darrin Crescenzi\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/reebok_2019_plasticy.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Reebok done In-house with Darrin Crescenzi\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/reebok_2019_shoe.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Reebok done In-house with Darrin Crescenzi\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/reebok_2019_stretchy_pants.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Reebok done In-house with Darrin Crescenzi\" \/>\n<figcaption>Various apparel applications.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>On the products, the logo looks great whether the icon is on its own or with the wordmark. Both are easy to reproduce and work well in the different production methods.
