It will be the sole distributor of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.onyxsolar.com\/distributors-onyxsolar.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Onyx solar panels<\/a> in Brazil, which is apparently a big deal in solar panel news. LIV is part of holding corporation <a href=\"http:\/\/grupotecnomont.com.br\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Grupo Tecnomont<\/a>, that offers a broad range of services in the industrial landscape, from renting cranes to performing mechanical assembly of factories. The new identity for LIV has been designed by Goiana, Brazil-based <a href=\"http:\/\/brbauen.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BR\/BAUEN<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>The strategy decision was based mainly on the functional fact as the overall performance of the company. We develop a name that performs well graphically and phonetically in different languages.<br \/><br \/>In addition to functionality, the argument and positioning the company as energy, life, movement gave us cohesive conceptual justifications to name LIV to a renewable energy company.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/brbauen.com\/projetos\/liv-energy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BR\/BAUEN project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/liv_energy_structure.png\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for LIV Energia by BR\/BAUEN\" \/>\n<figcaption>&#8220;The 3-Dimentionsional logotype was built considering the spin of windmill blades and the shape of solar capturing plaques.&#8221;<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/liv_energy_logo.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for LIV Energia by BR\/BAUEN\" \/>\n<figcaption>One of the many states of the logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/liv_energy_logo_various.png\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for LIV Energia by BR\/BAUEN\" \/>\n<figcaption>The many states of the logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/165943816?autoplay=1&#038;loop=1&#038;title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo animating at different speeds.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/liv_energy_logo_animation.gif\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for LIV Energia by BR\/BAUEN\" \/>\n<figcaption>Animation in isometric view.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The moment you hear or see &#8220;energy&#8221; associated with this logo &#8212; whether it&#8217;s on the URL of the website, when someone answers the phone at their office, or written in an ad &#8212; the triggered association with wind and renewable energy is instantaneous as you immediately see blades spinning in the minimal name. As a logo &#8212; in its static or straight-up state &#8212; it&#8217;s fairly ho-hum but as a device that can appear in slight variations across the identity it gains some momentum and appeal. The idea of the logo spinning at different speeds according to wind conditions is equal parts fun, nerdy, and business-appropriate.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/liv_energy_stationery.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for LIV Energia by BR\/BAUEN\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stationery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/liv_energy_stationery_envelopes.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for LIV Energia by BR\/BAUEN\" \/>\n<figcaption>Envelopes.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/liv_energy_business_cards.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for LIV Energia by BR\/BAUEN\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/liv_energy_folder.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for LIV Energia by BR\/BAUEN\" \/>\n<figcaption>Folder.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The choice of blue &#8212; for sky &#8212; is to be expected but what I like about it is that the applications are unapologetically BLUE, from top to bottom, side to side, with only the blades of the logo &#8212; as if they were actual blades of a windmill contrasting against the sky &#8212; in another color. The use of extra large renders of the blades in some of the applications are pretty adventurous and abstract. It&#8217;s the kind of thing you show in a first presentation but gets nixed by the client for being weird. On the flip side, the identity can feel rather cold and clinical, like a minimalistic-fixture vendor for hospitals.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/liv_energy_tape.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for LIV Energia by BR\/BAUEN\" \/>\n<figcaption>Tape. Too cool to be real; no tape vendor prints like that, but bonus points for pie-in-the-sky thinking.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/liv_energy_brochure.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for LIV Energia by BR\/BAUEN\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/liv_energy_report.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for LIV Energia by BR\/BAUEN\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brochures and report covers.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/liv_energy_helmets.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for LIV Energia by BR\/BAUEN\" \/>\n<figcaption>Hard hats.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/liv_energy_ad_large.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for LIV Energia by BR\/BAUEN\" \/>\n<figcaption>Billboard.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">The identity can extend in a couple of nice directions as in the brochures where the logo, used in white, looks like a strong corporate mark or as in the billboard directly above where it goes a little wilder with the different states of the logo floating on top of some large typography. (I know it&#8217;s not a real billboard but as a render of what the identity can do, it&#8217;s my favorite approach.) Overall, it&#8217;s an effective blend of corporate-ness and edginess to allows this new company to oxymoronically blend in yet stand out.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established this year, LIV Energia is a new company in Brazil, specializing in the distribution and implementation of renewable energy equipment and technology, including windmill and solar.
