It is loosely based on the 1980 movie <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fame_(1980_film)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Fame<\/em><\/a> that &#8220;chronicles of the lives of several teenagers who attend a New York high school for students gifted in the performing arts&#8221; (of which there was a remake in 2009). The show played for seven seasons until 2011 and after a seven year hiatus returned this March to Movistar and has two weeks left before the finale. The new identity for the show was designed by Madrid, Spain-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.erretres.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">erretres<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>&#8216;Fama A Bailar&#8217; by Movistar+ is based on concept of quality, rigor and authenticity, with dance as a universal value and the success of the dancer being the result of talent and hard work. Movistar+ sought a universal audience, with young people as the core target audience. Both the strategic concept and visual identity were developed to communicate the values of effort, progress, youth and quality.<br \/><br \/>The &#8216;Fama A Bailar&#8217; campaign strategy started with an umbrella concept: the fame is inside you &#8211; let it free. We synthesised this concept into a campaign tagline with the power to express an emotion both universal and personal, connecting the value of dance with that of the brand. This directly appeals to the entire target audience, and integrates the phrase into every instance of the campaign&#8217;s application. &#8220;Fama Vive en Ti&#8221; is a flexible concept, able to adapt to the needs of the extensive range of large-scale and social media applications.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.erretres.com\/portfolio\/fama-a-bailar\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">erretres project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fama_a_bailar_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for &lt;em&gt;Fama, \u00a1a bailar!&lt;\/em&gt; by erretres\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\" poster=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fama_logo_animation.jpg\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fama_logo_animation.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo animation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fama_a_bailar_logo_with_photo.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for &lt;em&gt;Fama, \u00a1a bailar!&lt;\/em&gt; by erretres\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo with photo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo was based on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=fame+movie+poster&#038;safe=active&#038;source=lnms&#038;tbm=isch&#038;sa=X&#038;ved=0ahUKEwixv_vi26rbAhUwITQIHfPdCZYQ_AUICigB&#038;biw=1419&#038;bih=844\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the movie posters<\/a> but modified in a way, it looked like, that minimized the chances of getting sued. Close enough to trigger an association but crappy enough to look like its own standalone thing. The new logo is a complete departure that signals the rebirth of the show with a decidedly more contemporary aesthetic. The logo is a geometrically-driven wordmark with an elastic structure that allows its letters to stretch, bounce, and rearrange themselves as a way to convey dance and movement. It&#8217;s a decent concept but the logo (and how it stretches) feels oddly stiff. Like, of all the ways to convey dance, this was the least fluid. It&#8217;s the equivalent of the <a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/_2bLcilzeqc?t=4m12s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sprockets dance<\/a>. Nonetheless, there is also something interesting about it, especially in static form, when the elasticity is widely exaggerated as in the image above. Like the old logo, the &#8220;a bailar&#8221; piece of the puzzle isn&#8217;t fully resolved and feels tacked on. I am guessing everybody calls the show &#8220;Fama&#8221; so it&#8217;s not a huge deal.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fama_a_bailar_photo_style.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for &lt;em&gt;Fama, \u00a1a bailar!&lt;\/em&gt; by erretres\" \/>\n<figcaption>Photography style.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fama_a_bailar_type_style.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for &lt;em&gt;Fama, \u00a1a bailar!&lt;\/em&gt; by erretres\" \/>\n<figcaption>Typographic style.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The identity is composed of custom photography that is fairly attractive, engaging, and nicely hued on each individual shot that is then paired with a mix of wide and condensed sans serif typography. I kind of like the type treatments but I feel like they clash heavily with the logo. They do do a good job of integrating the &#8220;a bailar&#8221; part, building it into sentences (like &#8220;A bailar Ballet \/ let&#8217;s dance ballet&#8221;). The color combinations can be a little jarring.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fama_a_bailar_posters.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for &lt;em&gt;Fama, \u00a1a bailar!&lt;\/em&gt; by erretres\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fama_a_bailar_round_poster_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for &lt;em&gt;Fama, \u00a1a bailar!&lt;\/em&gt; by erretres\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fama_a_bailar_round_poster_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for &lt;em&gt;Fama, \u00a1a bailar!&lt;\/em&gt; by erretres\" \/>\n<figcaption>Posters.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The applications are kind of interesting.
