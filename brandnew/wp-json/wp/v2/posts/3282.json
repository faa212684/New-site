Moving the letters around in a 9-square grid isn&#8217;t the newest of ideas but with that name, it&#8217;s almost impossible to resist the temptation to go there. It&#8217;s fun how the logo interacts with models on the photographs giving it a nice sense of dimension.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nimble_business_cards.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Nimble by Christopher Doyle &amp; Co.\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nimble_tags.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Nimble by Christopher Doyle &amp; Co.\" \/>\n<figcaption>Hang tags.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nimble_inside_tags.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Nimble by Christopher Doyle &amp; Co.\" \/>\n<figcaption>Rolls of apparel labels.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">In application, things are kept minimally designed to great effect. Just the logo and a complementary rounded sans serif. Good product and model photography convey the right attitude on the elegant website.
