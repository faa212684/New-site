AstroTurf has become as ubiquitous in language and common use as other brands like <em>Kleneex<\/em>, <em>Band-Aid<\/em>, or <em>Q-Tip<\/em> &mdash; yet AstroTurf owns no market share in the United States, even as a category creator. AstroTurf hopes their new identity and marketing campaign will put them a step above their competition and cut into the market share, mostly held by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fieldturf.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FieldTurf<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><p>It&#8217;s tough to compare and contrast AstroTurf&#8217;s logos. The prior looks like it was done in-house and a rush job where as the new mark, designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fwv-us.com\/home\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">French West Vaughan<\/a>, is elegant and thoughtful. I like how functional the mark is: able to stand alone yet flexible enough to be incorporated into a successful marketing campaign. It should be noted that the new logo is only for the U.S. market, hence the unapologetic color scheme. It is hard to dismiss the obvious correlations between this new mark and Amtrak, Bank of America, and the New England Patriots but, whatever inspired the new mark, it should still function as a great identity to attach to fake turf.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/astroturf_lookalikes.gif\" alt=\"Amtrak, Bank of America, and the New England Patriots\" \/>\n<span class=\"small\"><strong>Other tail-ey, flag-ey logos.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Make sure to check out the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fwv-us.com\/content\/page\/title\/AstroTurf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">new marketing campaign<\/a> and check out the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.astroturfusa.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">new website<\/a> which is amazing.
