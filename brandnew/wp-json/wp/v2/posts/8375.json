While Equinox isn&#8217;t the biggest fitness club, with only 83 locations, it does have one of the biggest and most alluring (for some) personalities with its ultra sexy photography and all-black fashion style. Dialing down the ripped-body, fitness focus of the clubs, the hotel is more about the indulgence of chilling out in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.architecturaldigest.com\/story\/equinox-hotel-hudson-yards\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tricked out digs<\/a> after working out. Equinox Hotels is already planning hotels in Houston, Chicago, and Los Angeles, with possible locations in London, and Hawaii.

It&#8217;s through this pursuit that they are lead to opposing extremes: Discipline and indulgence. Relentlessness and relaxation. Excess and absence.<br \/><br \/>They want it all. They go after it all. And they want a place that shares their appreciation for these collisions.

Spoiler: It&#8217;s not for me. However as not-for-me as it is and given the slightly douchey (for me, at least) way that Equinox markets its fitness clubs, the approach for the hotel brand, while still grandiose, is relatively restrained and even inviting.<\/p>\n<blockquote>We believed these dualities could complement each other. By crafting an uncommonly disciplined brand &#8212; rooted in the idea of extremes &#8212; we embraced this philosophy. Light and dark. Warm and cool. Hard and soft. Up and down. Black and white. Near and far. These extremes define the new brand of Equinox Hotels.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wearecollins.com\/work\/equinox-hotels\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">COLLINS project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\" style=\"padding-bottom: 67.25%;\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/371742782?title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0&#038;autoplay=1&#038;loop=1&#038;autopause=0&#038;background=1&#038;muted=1\" width=\"360\" height=\"203\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Shadow animation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>We looked to amplify the relevant equities built into the existing Equinox brand, yet elevate and evolve them. By taking a familiar graphic element from the original Equinox wordmark, for example, we could imbue it with new meaning and tell a new story. Now, in addition to inviting guests to work out with Equinox for a few hours, they are invited to stay for days. By embracing a tone of purposeful design restraint, we expand from the power of physical movement to the art of regeneration.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wearecollins.com\/work\/equinox-hotels\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">COLLINS project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/371741103?title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"360\" height=\"203\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo animation, taking the fitness club logo and expanding it.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/equinox_hotels_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Equinox Hotels by COLLINS\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The logo is a really great and clever extension of the well-known Equinox logo, taking the stenciled &#8220;O&#8221; and splitting each of its halves amongst the two words, creating an abstraction of night and day, sun and moon, all while establishing an elegant and sophisticated wordmark.
