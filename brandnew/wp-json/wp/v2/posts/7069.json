Transport for Wales exists to drive forward the Welsh Government&#8217;s vision of a high quality, safe, integrated, affordable and accessible transport network that the people of Wales are proud of. Transport for Wales is key to delivering the Welsh Government&#8217;s key themes as set out in Prosperity for All: The National Strategy. For Wales and its people to thrive, we need to be connected &#8211; to one another, to the services we need and to open up new opportunities. Our work focuses on making these connections happen &#8211; by planning, commissioning and managing efficient transport networks and by drawing on the very best skills from across industry, government and society. We are creating a transport network fit for the future that contributes to the long-term sustainability of Wales and those communities connected to us.&#8221;<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/transport_for_wales_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo for Transport for Wales by Sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/transport_for_wales_icon.png\" alt=\"New Logo for Transport for Wales by Sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord\" \/>\n<figcaption>Monogram.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/transport_for_wales_train_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Transport for Wales by Sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/transport_for_wales_train_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Transport for Wales by Sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord\" \/>\n<figcaption>Livery.
