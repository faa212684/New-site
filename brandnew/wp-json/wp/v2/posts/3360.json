Since I am not a Foursquare user I had no idea that this second app, Swarm, existed (since May of this year) and that the main check-in functionality of Foursquare &mdash; what made it famous in the first place &mdash; was being relocated in order to transform it into a &#8220;personalized local search&#8221; app. To signal the change to this new two-app model and the new <em>raison d&#8217;&ecirc;tre<\/em> of the famed app, Foursquare has introduced a new logo designed in collaboration with Brooklyn, NY-based <a href=\"http:\/\/redantler.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Red Antler<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/foursquare_old_app_icon.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Foursquare in Collaboration with Red Antler\" \/>\n<figcaption>The current\/old app icon. Not officially a logo, I think. Just an app icon graphic.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>Our teams worked hand in hand through every step of the process, from strategy through design, to understand all aspects of Foursquare&#8217;s new services and the user interface. And when we say we &#8216;worked together&#8217;, we mean that literally; the Red Antler design team worked onsite at the Foursquare office, and Foursquare designers often spent days in RA&#8217;s Dumbo office.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/redantler.com\/find-fun-with-foursquare\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Red Antler blog post<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/foursquare_logo_process.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Foursquare in Collaboration with Red Antler\" \/>\n<figcaption>Process.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>Second, if you build a totally new app, you need a totally new logo. Our logo is changing from the check-in checkmark to something representing the new Foursquare. We designed it to be a mix of map pin and superhero emblem. We&#8217;ve always thought of Foursquare as giving you superpowers to explore your city, and our new logo reflects that vision. It&#8217;s coming soon to a homescreen near you.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/blog.foursquare.com\/post\/92636287198\/a-brand-new-foursquare-with-a-brand-new-logo-and-look\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Foursquare blog post<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/foursquare_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo for Foursquare in Collaboration with Red Antler\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/foursquare_icon_ripples.png\" alt=\"New Logo for Foursquare in Collaboration with Red Antler\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icon with ripple effect.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old wordmark managed to make House Industries&#8217; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.houseind.com\/fonts\/neutraface\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Neutraface<\/a> (italic) look like it was the Mayor of Uglyville by wrapping it in an unfortunate stroke and smushing the letters together real good. Meanwhile, the app icon was a giant checkmark merged with a pin &mdash; a decent concept to start with but the execution was sloppy and unsophisticated. The new monogram and wordmark correct all of these wrongs.<\/p>\n<p>The all-uppercase wordmark is bold, solid, and contemporary, and I&#8217;m loving the &#8220;Q&#8221;. I particularly enjoy that it&#8217;s not another flimsy Humanist sans to make it look more friendly and approachable. The new monogram is cool. It&#8217;s immediately clear that it&#8217;s both an &#8220;F&#8221; and a pin, and it could also be interpreted as a speech bubble, which is not a bad thing, since it&#8217;s all about the feedback of users on each location. As far as the superhero emblem thinking&hellip; yeah, that&#8217;s cute but I wouldn&#8217;t make a whole PR thing about it.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/foursquare_swarm.png\" alt=\"New Logo for Foursquare in Collaboration with Red Antler\" \/>\n<figcaption>Updated &#8220;Swarm by Foursquare&#8221; graphic.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/foursquare_app_comparison.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Foursquare in Collaboration with Red Antler\" \/>\n<figcaption>Old and new app screen comparison. <\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/foursquare_app_new.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Foursquare in Collaboration with Red Antler\" \/>\n<figcaption>New app home page.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">While the logo change is relevant and has been well done, this is a clear case of Foursquare wanting to establish a fresh beginning, moving away from any remnants of its original identity in order to rally users for its new functionality. The new logo and identity&#8217;s true success will depend on whether users embrace the revised namesake app, due next month, and pull double duty with the other app, Swarm. At a time where we are already scrambling to keep up with apps for Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Vine, and even Yelp (a clear competitor in the recommendation\/reviews area), it&#8217;s a challenging proposition, so all those superpowers the new logo is meant to have will be needed.<\/p>\n<p class=\"gray_50\">PS. Given the recent propensity of the internet to find genitalia in logos I am happy to report that no one has mentioned that the counterspace between the F&#8217;s crossbars look like a pink, erect penis. Maybe all the writers at HuffPo and FastCo and Gizmodo and Adweek, et al already met their quota for the year for stories of genitalia logos.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Launched in 2009 at SXSW Interactive (obvs!) as a stand-alone app allowing users to check in at a location and see other users&apos; location, Foursquare is now a double-threat ecosystem of apps: Swarm, for checking in and the eponymous Foursquare&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,75,26],"tags":[40,747,42,446],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3360"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3360"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3360\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3360"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3360"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3360"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
