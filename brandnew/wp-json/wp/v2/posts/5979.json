Created by MiresBall Associate Creative Director Miguel P\u00e9rez and Senior Designer Shawn Ritzenthaler, the packaging features playful lettering and an illustration inspired by a sea-protecting Poseidon, giving the can a whimsical aura.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/miresball.com\/coronado-brewing-and-surfrider-foundation-launch-new-beer-collaboration\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MiresBall blog post<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/coastwise_ipa_lettering.png\" alt=\"New Packaging for CoastWise Session IPA by MiresBall\" \/>\n<figcaption>Type treatment detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/coastwise_ipa_can_3_sides.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for CoastWise Session IPA by MiresBall\" \/>\n<figcaption>Can.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>CoastWise doesn&#8217;t fall within the criteria for a product or client for Brand New&#8217;s Reviewed section as it&#8217;s a single beer within the larger offering of a craft brewery but I was smitten by the design and, hey, it&#8217;s all for a good cause: <strike>Beer<\/strike> Helping protect the oceans.<\/p>\n<p>The design consists of a charming Poseidon illustration with the cutest little arms and friendliest of tridents. I love how it&#8217;s a very unique, graphic interpretation that looks almost like Pixar-level character exploration work. Poseidon is then paired with scribbled, surfer-vibe script lettering that keeps the aesthetic fun and loose while establishing an unexpected Yin and Yang of type and image that works beautifully on cans and boxes.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video controls><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/coastwise_ipa_animation.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Can animation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/coastwise_ipa_can_shelf.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for CoastWise Session IPA by MiresBall\" \/>\n<figcaption>Cans on the shelf.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/coastwise_ipa_can_packing.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for CoastWise Session IPA by MiresBall\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/coastwise_ipa_can_packing_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for CoastWise Session IPA by MiresBall\" \/>\n<figcaption>Cans being packaged.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/coastwise_ipa_case_packing_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for CoastWise Session IPA by MiresBall\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/coastwise_ipa_case_packing_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for CoastWise Session IPA by MiresBall\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/coastwise_ipa_case_packing_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for CoastWise Session IPA by MiresBall\" \/>\n<figcaption>Cases being packaged.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/coastwise_ipa_6pack.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for CoastWise Session IPA by MiresBall\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/coastwise_ipa_6pack_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for CoastWise Session IPA by MiresBall\" \/>\n<figcaption>6-pack.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/coastwise_ipa_pint_glass.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for CoastWise Session IPA by MiresBall\" \/>\n<figcaption>Pint glass.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">One of the most impressive things about the packaging system is that everything is done in a single color but by modulating the size relationships between lettering and illustration, there is a great sense of variety throughout the applications.
