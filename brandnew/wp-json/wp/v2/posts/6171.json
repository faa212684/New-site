Presented in bottles (affectionately referred to as &#8220;stubbies&#8221;), cans, and cartons, Stumptown Cold Brew is now widely available in national retailers, online, and, obviously, at Stumptown cafes in a variety of flavors and finishes, including a carbonated, sparkling rendition. The very detailed story of how the Cold Brew came to be can be found <a href=\"https:\/\/www.stumptowncoffee.com\/blog\/cold-brew-stubby-history\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a>.

The new logo is a much more handsome rendition of the roaster&#8217;s name while still showcasing plenty of personality. The one strange thing &#8212; and perhaps it&#8217;s not necessary &#8212; the logo doesn&#8217;t include &#8220;Cold Brew&#8221;. I get it completely that the packaging will always say &#8220;Cold Brew&#8221; and the logo is meant to inform the buyer of who this cold brew is from but I imagine there might be instances where a logo would be needed that says &#8220;Stumptown Coffee Roasters Cold Brew&#8221;. Nonetheless, a lovely script logo.<\/p>\n<blockquote>We created a custom illustrated seal to express quality and heritage. The Horseshoe has been with the brand since inception  &#8212; representing their motto of &#8220;Good Luck&#8221;.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/columnseattle.com\/project\/stumptown-cold-brew\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Column project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/stumptown_cold_brew_seal.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Stumptown Cold Brew by Column\" \/>\n<figcaption>Seal.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/stumptown_cold_brew_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Stumptown Cold Brew by Column\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/stumptown_cold_brew_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Stumptown Cold Brew by Column\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/stumptown_cold_brew_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Stumptown Cold Brew by Column\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/stumptown_cold_brew_15.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Stumptown Cold Brew by Column\" \/>\n<figcaption>Bottle.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/stumptown_cold_brew_04.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Stumptown Cold Brew by Column\" \/>\n<figcaption>Bottle in real life.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old bottle packaging was good&#8230; again, kind of operating on the same premise of not trying too hard and looking like something you would buy at a general store down in some remote highway. The new bottles do try a little harder but it&#8217;s for the better as there is a great refinement to the design and the integration between the shape of the bottle and the design on it. The angled logo somehow accentuates the funky shape of the bottle better than before and the typography is crisper and more functional. The seal looks fantastic on the caps.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/stumptown_cold_brew_05.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Stumptown Cold Brew by Column\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/stumptown_cold_brew_06.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Stumptown Cold Brew by Column\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/stumptown_cold_brew_07.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Stumptown Cold Brew by Column\" \/>\n<figcaption>Can.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/stumptown_cold_brew_08.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Stumptown Cold Brew by Column\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/stumptown_cold_brew_09.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Stumptown Cold Brew by Column\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/stumptown_cold_brew_09a.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Stumptown Cold Brew by Column\" \/>\n<figcaption>Can in real life.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/stumptown_cold_brew_10.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Stumptown Cold Brew by Column\" \/>\n<figcaption>Baby can!<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/stumptown_cold_brew_11.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Stumptown Cold Brew by Column\" \/>\n<figcaption>Baby can in real life.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The can versions are super nice with white as the background offsetting a tasty color palette and the gold rims of the cans work to top it all off while matching the gold strokes used in some of the design elements.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/stumptown_cold_brew_12.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Stumptown Cold Brew by Column\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/stumptown_cold_brew_13.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Stumptown Cold Brew by Column\" \/>\n<figcaption>Small cartons.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Even these cartons are killer.
