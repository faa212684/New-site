The new logo, at first, is kind of quirky to look at, especially at small sizes, with the counterspace of the &#8220;e&#8221; playing tricks on you until you realize it&#8217;s a wooden spoon. It&#8217;s a fun idea and it&#8217;s done well, providing a point of distinction to the otherwise uniform, lowercase Gotham wordmark. The logo is meant to be used primarily on a wood texture, establishing the main material used by the company. Since most of its applications appear to be full-color packaging, it shouldn&#8217;t be a problem to maintain its use.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/epicurean_packaging_01_before-after.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Epicurean by Duffy &amp; Partners\" \/>\n<figcaption>Comparison of before and after packaging of two products: rolling pin box and cutting board label.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/epicurean_packaging_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Epicurean by Duffy &amp; Partners\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/epicurean_packaging_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Epicurean by Duffy &amp; Partners\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/epicurean_packaging_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Epicurean by Duffy &amp; Partners\" \/>\n<figcaption>Samples of new packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/epicurean_totes.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Epicurean by Duffy &amp; Partners\" \/>\n<figcaption>Totes.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/epicurean_price_sheet.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Epicurean by Duffy &amp; Partners\" \/>\n<figcaption>Price sheet.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/epicurean_trade_show_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Epicurean by Duffy &amp; Partners\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/epicurean_trade_show_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Epicurean by Duffy &amp; Partners\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/epicurean_trade_show_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Epicurean by Duffy &amp; Partners\" \/>\n<figcaption>Trade show booth.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">The more interesting part of the identity is the introduction of a pattern of their products and other nature-y ornaments that can be used in different color combinations, working particularly well in single color as seen in the totes and price sheet. I really like the use of the dot texture to add a halftone effect. The packaging is a handsome, modular combination of all the elements that looks cohesive from labels to boxes. Overall, a solid redesign that better communicates Epicurean&#8217;s eco-leanings.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Launched in 2003 and based in Duluth, Minnesota, Epicurean designs, manufactures, and sells premier cutting surfaces and essential utensils for the kitchen from cutting boards to rolling pins to spoons all in an environmentally conscious production cycle and materials.
