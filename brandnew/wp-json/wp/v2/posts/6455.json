It was originally developed for the iPad and it was one of the coolest most useful apps in the early days of the iPad. It has since expanded to Android and to browsers on desktops and laptops and now counts with more than 100 million monthly active users. Recently Flipboard introduced a new identity designed in-house in collaboration with San Francisco, CA-based <a href=\"http:\/\/monikersf.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Moniker<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>Our original manifesto states &#8220;great stories move the world forward.&#8221; We believe access to high-quality content and diverse perspectives helps us make informed decisions, take action and be better world citizens. This is why our logo was conceived in 2010 as a window onto great stories, with transparent window panes at its center.<br \/><br \/>So this year, we reimagined the logo as a fully open window, reset our logotype using our custom Fakt Flipboard condensed, and restored balance to the lockup. Our red also got a nice refresh. We&#8217;re just a little brighter everywhere.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/flipboard-design\/finding-clarity-in-a-time-of-chaos-the-role-of-the-flipboard-brand-today-770e0759f4c9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Flipboard post on Medium<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/flipboard_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Flipboard by Moniker and In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/flipboard_icon.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Flipboard by Moniker and In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icon.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/flipboard_logo_as_window.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Flipboard by Moniker and In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo-as-window.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>When I first got an iPad (that I won in a webfont competition for the design of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/quipsologies\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Quipsologies<\/a>, thank you) and had no idea what to do with it, Flipboard was basically the only application I used or found useful. I gave up on the iPad years ago and was surprised to hear Flipboard is still around. Good for them! Anyway, on to the logo&#8230; I always liked their slightly pixelated &#8220;F&#8221; icon; it was simple and striking. Its evolution into a single-color version with no transparency makes sense as more and more logos go basic. In this case, it works great for the icon as it&#8217;s literally less fuzzy, it&#8217;s as simple as it gets, and it yields a great-looking icon\/monogram. The old wordmark was fine but the new one &#8212; in a customized version of Fakt &#8212; works a lot better.<\/p>\n<p>With an icon that has such defined edges and a nice, big square area, it&#8217;s no surprise they went with the logo-as-window approach for some applications but I like that they pushed that idea a little further to create a puzzle-like treatment that gives an interesting twist to the approach.<\/p>\n<blockquote>Our F becomes a distinct storytelling platform where we can feature inspiring points of view.<br \/><br \/>And, you might notice a staircase in the white space. This was a serendipitous discovery, but once we saw it, we couldn&#8217;t unsee it. Because it speaks so well to our vision of advancing the conversation, the team decided to pursue this concept in more depth.<br \/><br \/>The stair led to the development of what we are calling the F Step pattern. [&hellip;] What we landed on are a set of specific juxtapositions that map to our core identity. From the macro to the micro, local to global (self investment, to community engagement), to strong opposing forces or different sides of a story.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/flipboard-design\/finding-clarity-in-a-time-of-chaos-the-role-of-the-flipboard-brand-today-770e0759f4c9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Flipboard post on Medium<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/flipboard_fstep_pattern_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Flipboard by Moniker and In-house\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/flipboard_fstep_pattern_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Flipboard by Moniker and In-house\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/flipboard_fstep_pattern_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Flipboard by Moniker and In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>&#8220;F Step Pattern&#8221;.
