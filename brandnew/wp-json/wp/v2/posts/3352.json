I guess that&#8217;s the point of this, right? &mdash; I have no idea what exactly the pulling tape device is supposed to be or represent or if there is some sort of device that has such a system where a strip of cloth comes out of. Maybe it&#8217;s a UK thing. But back to what I think is funny is that I feel like I also know exactly what it is. Sort of. It feels like the wind-up device of a toy, like getting a paper prize out of some Chuck E. Cheese arcade, like the production tag on a stuffed teddy bear, like ribbons and pennants at a carnival, etc. Feel-good things. Without being anything in particular, it&#8217;s a lot of different things that trigger good memories. The pulling sound, as you&#8217;ll hear in the video below, is what makes it work as funny, too.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/uktv_gold_logo_categories_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Idents for Gold by DixonBaxi\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/uktv_gold_logo_categories_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Idents for Gold by DixonBaxi\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/uktv_gold_logo_categories_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Idents for Gold by DixonBaxi\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/uktv_gold_logo_categories_04.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Idents for Gold by DixonBaxi\" \/>\n<figcaption>Ticker tape with different kinds of funny.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/100927084?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=f0001c\" width=\"682\" height=\"384\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Montage of idents.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/uktv_gold_process.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Idents for Gold by DixonBaxi\" \/>\n<figcaption>Process.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>There isn&#8217;t much to it, is there? But it&#8217;s amazing how good it feels to look at all those silly things. I mean, squishing a gummy bear? Sprinkles on an ice cream? Falling Jell-O? These are such simple pleasures, brought effortlessly together in smile-inducing idents.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/uktv_gold_advertising.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Idents for Gold by DixonBaxi\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sample advertising.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/uktv_gold_baloon.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Idents for Gold by DixonBaxi\" \/>\n<figcaption>Balloons.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">In the more formal applications, like advertising, the tape gets a little lost in the kerfuffle of text and images and doesn&#8217;t seem as well resolved coming off the bands of color but the big condensed and colorful sans serif looks quite nice. Overall, it&#8217;s a fun take on comedy channel branding that relies more on triggers for joy than trying to land a punchline every five seconds.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"First launched in 1992 as UK Gold and serving mainly to broadcast classic series from the archives of its owners, BBC and Thames Television, and part of the UKTV network since 1997, Gold (as it is now known) is a&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,66,26],"tags":[617,841,290],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3352"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3352"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3352\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3352"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3352"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3352"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
