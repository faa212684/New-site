While remaining strongly rooted in the reality of Qu&eacute;bec, it projects a new, attentive and dynamic outlook on all of human experience in its whole, and on civilizations from the world over.&#8221; The organization is a network of five museums that includes its flagship and eponymous museum plus the Mus&eacute;e de l&#8217;Am&eacute;rique francophone, Mus&eacute;e de la place Royale, Maison historique Chevalier, and Centre national de conservation et d&#8217;&eacute;tudes des collections. Although <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/muse_de_la_civilisation.php#.UhXlXGTXh90\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">we reported<\/a> on the new logo back in April, the post was incomplete and even had the wrong new logos in it, so now we have the full story and imagery of the new identity designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/lg2.com\/fr\/realisations\/445\/musee-de-la-civilisation-du-quebec-branding\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">lg2<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>The goal was to develop a brand platform that allowed the five sites to speak with one voice, but also individually to preserve the roots of their respective identities. The platform also had to reflect the distinctive cultural mission they shared of showcasing the common elements of the human experience through collections, innovative exhibitions and educational activities.<br \/><br \/>A simplified, vibrant and unifying visual identity was designed based on MCQ&#8217;s initial logo and a colour code for each network site. This identity applies to stationery, indoor and outdoor signage, and printed material (media kits, newspaper ads and posters). The flexibility of the new brand platform ensures it can also be used for advertising.<\/blockquote><h3>Provided press release<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/musee_civilisation_redux_logos_all.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Mus&eacute;e de la civilisation by lg2\" \/>\n<figcaption>Four other logos that are part of the same family.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/musee_civilisation_redux_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Mus&eacute;e de la civilisation by lg2\" \/>\n<figcaption>Signage.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/musee_civilisation_redux_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Mus&eacute;e de la civilisation by lg2\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stationery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/musee_civilisation_redux_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Mus&eacute;e de la civilisation by lg2\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brochure.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/musee_civilisation_redux_04.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Mus&eacute;e de la civilisation by lg2\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brochure detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/musee_civilisation_redux_05.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Mus&eacute;e de la civilisation by lg2\" \/>\n<figcaption>Pins.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/musee_civilisation_redux_06.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Mus&eacute;e de la civilisation by lg2\" \/>\n<figcaption>Signage.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/musee_civilisation_redux_07.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Mus&eacute;e de la civilisation by lg2\" \/>\n<figcaption>Banner.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">While I kidded in the original post that Charlie Brown had called and asked for the stripe on his sweater back, the new logo is actually an interesting abstraction of the letter &#8220;M&#8221; that doubles as an evolution of the previous mark (which I am not sure what it meant &mdash; perhaps five slashes for the five museums). It seems the wrong letter to focus on &mdash; why not the &#8220;C&#8221;? &mdash; since the museum part is not what makes this museum unique but the civilization part. Regardless, the mark has a very strong presence and works well in most of the applications even if at times it is used too big. The typography on the logo and on application feels a little undercooked, not just because of it being Gotham but it&#8217;s missing one more layer of interesting-ness beyond flush-left-ness. Overall, it&#8217;s a relatively satisfying identity with an intriguing icon.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1988, the Mus&eacute;e de la civilisation in Qu&eacute;bec City, Qu&eacute;bec is described as being the link between &#8220;the past, the present and the future.
