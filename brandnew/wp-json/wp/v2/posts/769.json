Given the amount of e-mails I received about the redesign of French manufacturer <a href=\"http:\/\/www.citroen.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Citro&euml;n<\/a>, I am going to assume that their cars and brand mean a lot to a lot of people.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/citroen_photo_00.jpg\" alt=\"Citro&euml;n DS Inside concept car\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Citro&euml;n DS Inside concept car.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.landor.com\/index.cfm?do=ourwork.casehistory&#038;cn=6324\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Designed by Landor<\/a>, the new logo comes as Citro&euml;n celebrates its 90th anniversary (founded in 1919) and as it unveils new models of its DS line (no idea what the DS line is but, again, looks like it&#8217;s a big deal &mdash; no need, dear readers, to lecture me on the importance of Citro&euml;n, I do get it). The chevron icon has, of course, been Neue Metalized&trade; (someone had to come up with a style for car logos, right?) to appear as if it had come straight from the grill. Sarcasm aside, <em>it is<\/em> a somewhat attractive rendering, and the softer, rounder shapes make the new icon more distinguishable than the previous, in the sense that anyone can invert two straight-edged V shapes and call it a logo.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/citroen_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"Citroen Logo, Detail\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The typography, ayayay, I don&#8217;t know, why does it have to look as if it came from the future? The membrane-y stuff that comes off the crossbar of T and the joining of the umlaut just feels too space age. And why is the N lowercase? This would have been much nicer if they had dialed down on the sci-fi ingredients. In general, it feels like a good upgrade into the twenty-first century but a lot of the sophistication and Old World charm of the previous logo is gone which, perhaps unfortunately, was the intention.
