The team is one of the ten charter members of MLS which competed in the league&#8217;s first season in 1996 (originally as the San Jose Clash) and took part in the first game in MLS history, defeating D.C. United 1-0. Following the conclusion of the 2005 MLS season, the franchise was officially put on hiatus and the players, head coach Dominic Kinnear and some of his coaching staff were moved to Houston, Texas, where they became the Houston Dynamo. After a two-year absence, the Earthquakes resumed play for the 2008 season. The Earthquakes have won two MLS Cup titles, in 2001 and 2003, and two MLS Supporters&#8217; Shields, in 2005 and 2012. The team currently plays home games at Buck Shaw Stadium on the Santa Clara University campus in Santa Clara, California, and is coached by former Canadian international player Mark Watson.&#8221; (Source: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/San_Jose_Earthquakes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wikipedia<\/a>)<\/p><!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/san_jose_quakes_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for San Jose Earthquakes by Fiction\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/san_jose_quakes_explanation.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for San Jose Earthquakes by Fiction\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo explanation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/san_jose_quakes_impact_pattern.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for San Jose Earthquakes by Fiction\" \/>\n<figcaption>Principal unit of the &#8220;Impact Pattern&#8221;.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/san_jose_quakes_jerseys.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for San Jose Earthquakes by Fiction\" \/>\n<figcaption>New jerseys.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/san_jose_quakes_posters.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for San Jose Earthquakes by Fiction\" \/>\n<figcaption>A poster wall.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/utzhStzR_cg\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>New logo introduction.
