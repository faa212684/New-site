Their packaging and identity, designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/kurppahosk.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kurppa Hosk<\/a>, is almost annoyingly simple with the most stylized element of the system being the curved typography over the name. While I usually dislike &#8220;R&#8221;s with such a long leg, this one feels like just the right choice for this minimalist design. Complemented by a thinner monospace font, the logo manages to stand out nicely in this wide range of bottle shapes and sizes that benefit greatly from a wonderful, earthy-pastel-metallic color palette which makes it squeeze through (and above) other products with the hipster, too-cool-to-care aesthetic. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/kurppahosk.com\/work\/ref\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Ben Johnston by Ben Johnston<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_benjohnston.jpg\" alt=\"Ben Johnston by Ben Johnston\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.benjohnston.ca\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ben Johnston<\/a> is a designer and letterer in Toronto, CA, with a pretty bad-ass portfolio and a stationery set to match. I really enjoy that this is purely graphical for the sake of being awesome: no concept, no pretense, no mission, just a 300-pound-bench-press of calligraphic skill display. Printed black on medium gray and black paper makes the otherwise flowery letters that would seem more appropriate for a wedding invitation feel like they belong to a dude that paints on walls a lot for a living. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/31334955\/Letterpress-Branding\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Spectator Hotel by Stitch Design Co.<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_spectatorhotel.jpg\" alt=\"Spectator Hotel by Stitch Design Co.\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/thespectatorhotel.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Spectator Hotel<\/a> is a boutique hotel in the French Quarter and Market Street districts of Charleston, SC, exuding vintage style and charm.
