The food is made, tested, and delivered in the United States. Like a handful of modern history entrepreneurial success stories, Pet Plate founder Renaldo Webb appeared on <em>Shark Tank<\/em> in 2017 but received no deals. According to <a href=\"http:\/\/sharktanktales.com\/petplate-shark-tank\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this update<\/a> he went on to raise $4 million in seed money soon after followed by another undisclosed round &#8212; how you like &rsquo;em apples with chicken liver now, Sharks? As its growth continues, Pet Plate introduced a new brand identity and packaging last year, designed by New York-based Sagmeister &amp; Walsh (prior to the creation of <a href=\"https:\/\/andwalsh.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">&amp;Walsh<\/a>).<\/p>\n<!--more--><p>Side note: At this year&#8217;s Brand New Conference we will hear from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ritesh-gupta.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ritesh Gupta<\/a> who led the redesign as the Senior Director of Brand &amp; UX at Pet Plate.<\/p>\n<blockquote>Contrary to the approach of many of our competitors, we wanted to create an identity that humanizes and celebrates dogs in a playful and approachable way and appeals to both humans and dogs.<br \/><br \/>We were inspired by how dog sees the world, blue and white porcelain plates, and by Winston (founder Renaldo&#8217;s goofy dog).<br \/><br \/>Humanizing and appealing to dogs manifested in using plates (not bowls), blue (one of the few colors dogs can see), and various applications below.<br \/><br \/>Nearly every asset shared below was created and utilized in the real world.<\/blockquote><h3>Ritesh Gupta provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/petplate_color_spectrum.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Pet Plate by Sagmeister &amp; Walsh and In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Spectrum of colors dog can see (vs. hoomans).<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/petplate_logo_inverse.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Pet Plate by Sagmeister &amp; Walsh and In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo, stacked.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>A customized <a href=\"https:\/\/ortype.is\/specimen\/separat\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Separat<\/a> was utilized for the basis of the logo.

A little too cute, but sure, it worked, and it had good typography to keep it company. If anything, perhaps it lacked excitement and maybe looked too conservative &#8212; the latter being only evident in contrast to the direction they went in. The new logo avoids using a dog visual, which is probably smart given that there are so many different dogs that you don&#8217;t want to have to pick just one to represent all dogs. Using <a href=\"https:\/\/ortype.is\/specimen\/separat\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Separat<\/a> as a base, which is a super whack typeface, the new logo gets an instant contemporary vibe and edge from the relatively unconventional proportions of the letters and features great &#8220;P&#8221;s that look like tongues sticking out, which was my gut reaction before even seeing the animation above. Luckily, the name of the company doesn&#8217;t have any &#8220;B&#8221;s or &#8220;R&#8221;s because there is nothing worse in the typographic universe than Separat&#8217;s &#8220;B&#8221; and &#8220;R&#8221; &#8212; which were smartly updated in the final customized version of the full typeface. The choice of &#8220;that blue&#8221; can perhaps be accepted by the rationalization that blue is one of the colors dogs can see but as the chart at the top shows, they certainly can&#8217;t see &#8220;that blue&#8221; and they are probably better off for it. In combination with the typography and the funky illustrations, the blue can be overpowering at times but it certainly doesn&#8217;t lack impact and a point of distinction for Pet Plate among other dog food services.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/petplate_logo_seal.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Pet Plate by Sagmeister &amp; Walsh and In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Seal logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/petplate_secondary_logos.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Pet Plate by Sagmeister &amp; Walsh and In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Secondary logos.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>One of Pet Plate&#8217;s main objectives was showing that they serve human-quality dog food. With this in mind, we took inspiration from the traditional blue and white style decorative plates that have roots in cultures all over the world. We balanced the fine line illustrations with bold, funky typefaces and humorous copywriting to establish a playful tone of voice.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/andwalsh.com\/work\/all\/pet-plate\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">&amp;Walsh project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/petplate_patterns_01.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Pet Plate by Sagmeister &amp; Walsh and In-house\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/petplate_patterns_02.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Pet Plate by Sagmeister &amp; Walsh and In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Patterns.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>If the logo and electric blue weren&#8217;t enough to set Pet Plate apart, things get wilder with the range of illustrations that are a kind of stream of dog consciousness from the minds of the (Sagmeister) &amp; Walsh team, with dogs wearing hats, drinking wine, lounging on beach chairs, and flanked by  things like seashells, statues of liberty, poop, and all kinds of vegetables. All in that blue. I don&#8217;t like-them-like-them but they are highly enjoyable in an unhinged kind of way. When photos replace the illustrated dog faces it gets even more ludicrous and it&#8217;s pretty amazing that Pet Plate went with something so out there.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/petplate_crest_illustrations.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Pet Plate by Sagmeister &amp; Walsh and In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>&#8220;Crest&#8221; illustrations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/petplate_crests_animated.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Crest illustrations, animated.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/petplate_illustrations.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Pet Plate by Sagmeister &amp; Walsh and In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Other illustrations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>We also created a custom dog emoji set for Pet Plate because<br \/><br \/>1.

With this service being primarily in New York, the impact of these boxes waiting outside someone&#8217;s apartment is a great, consistent advertisement. There is also something refreshingly unpretentious about the white tubs with the blue labels&#8230; like, it&#8217;s not trying to turn the food into something you would find at Whole Foods with a super healthy vibe but is instead very matter-of-fact and makes it feel less &#8220;precious&#8221;.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/petplate_tote_collar.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Pet Plate by Sagmeister &amp; Walsh and In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Tote and collar.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>In collaboration with various parties, we created a range of photography of dogs doing human things, packaging, and swag.<\/blockquote><h3>Ritesh Gupta provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/petplate_photography_table.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Pet Plate by Sagmeister &amp; Walsh and In-house\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/petplate_photography_box.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Pet Plate by Sagmeister &amp; Walsh and In-house\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/petplate_photography_plates.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Pet Plate by Sagmeister &amp; Walsh and In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Lifestyle photography.

My only grievance would be the overabundance of that blue but I also can&#8217;t imagine it working as well (or as bad, lol) if it were in another color or combination of colors. Overall, I think this is pretty entertaining and appropriate in a way that&#8217;s unexpected.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 2016, New York, NY-based Pet Plate is an online, direct-to-consumer, healthy dog food subscription service.
