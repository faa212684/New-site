The festival is modeled after popular film festivals around the country and brings a variety of films &#8212; and some of their actors, directors, and writers &#8212; from around the world to the small town of Montclair. The success of the festival has lead its organizers to host year-round workshops and events beyond the festival and to coincide with this year&#8217;s festival this Spring, the organization, simply <a href=\"http:\/\/montclairfilm.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Montclair Film<\/a>, introduced a new identity designed by New York, NY-based <a href=\"http:\/\/hieronymus.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hieronymus<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>Starting with a brand audit and naming, the challenge was to develop a naming system that preserved the brand equity of The Montclair Film Festival to date, while representing the diverse programming to come. The name Montclair Film is a nice large umbrella, providing a seamless rollout of sub-brands&#8211;some workhorses, and some of the cheekier variety (Montclair Film + Chill).<br \/><br \/>Working hand in hand with the Montclair Film team, Hieronymus devised a flexible identity system that reflects their core mission; bringing together many different people&#8211;audiences, filmmakers, students and artists&#8211;with the goal of educating and entertaining at the same time. The new identity allows for unique yearly festival applications with some rules in place to keep it all cohesive.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/hieronymus.co\/work\/montclair-film\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hieronymus project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/221935186?color=f45455\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Identity presentation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/montclair_film_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Montclair Film by Hieronymus\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/montclair_film_logo_subbrands.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Montclair Film by Hieronymus\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sub-brands.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/montclair_film_logo_arrow_behavior.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Montclair Film by Hieronymus\" \/>\n<figcaption>Frame behavior.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>At first glance, the new logo may not seem the most exciting or original, using the corner-frame motif that is common amongst industries that use cameras &#8212; a recent example would be <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/new_logo_and_identity_for_frameline_by_mucho.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mucho&#8217;s Frameline identity<\/a> &#8212; to frame stuff.
