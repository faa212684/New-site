As a refresher: The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.uefa.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Union of European Football Associations<\/a> (UEFA) has been around since 1954. It is comprised of 53 European associations and is headquartered in Nyon, Switzerland. Since 1960, UEFA has held one of their Pan European competitions, the UEFA European Football Championship, every four years in member countries, most recently in Austria\/Switzerland (2008) and Poland\/Ukraine (2012). France will host the 2016 championship and will include 24 teams as opposed to the usual 16, meaning more visitors. Brandia Central&#8217;s design revolves around France&#8217;s artistic reputation.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>The mixture of both quantity and quality in one of the most important sporting events of the world demanded a brand approach like never before. Combining the festivity and the &#8220;footballness&#8221; of a UEFA tournament with the sophisticated and exquisite taste of France, this event needed a cr&eacute;me de la cr&eacute;me brand. The starting point was the theme &#8220;Celebrating the Art of the Football&#8221;.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.brandiacentral.com\/uk\/case-studies\/euro2016-france\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brandia Central case study<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/g8kaZBtxPhY\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>&#8220;The Brand of Football Art&#8221; animation, a must-watch. Unfortunately the only embeddable version is low resolution. A better version can be watched <a href=\"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/69156746\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a>.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The animation is really the best part of it all. It helps establish the concept and bring it to life in a visually catchy way. The initial tricks of building the typography out of wiggles and doodads is pretty hypnotic. It then goes into a few tacky effects and styles but once you realize it&#8217;s all about showcasing the different art expressions and movements you sort of buy into it &mdash; except the 3D players, those are just weird. But the logo won&#8217;t always come with a two-minute animation&hellip;<\/p>\n<blockquote>In addition to branding the tournament, it&#8217;s a celebration of football as a form of art, inspired by the artistic references Frances has showcased to the world. [&hellip;] To depict art in one symbol, we followed the most inclusive of art approaches: eclecticism. Inspired by several art movements, the logotype combines distinct backgrounds, from fauvism to abstractionism, from France&#8217;s flag to football icons.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.brandiacentral.com\/uk\/case-studies\/euro2016-france\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brandia Central case study<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/euro_2016_elements.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for UEFA EURO 2016 by Brandia Central\" \/>\n<figcaption>The symbol&#8217;s ingredients.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/euro_2016_logo_detail.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for UEFA EURO 2016 by Brandia Central\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The logo on its own &mdash; in all its Pixar-ness &mdash; is surprisingly interesting and it definitely leans into the artsier spectrum of sports logos. Most of the ingredients and wiggles and doodads are non-decipherable but as a whole the logo looks French (red, white, and blue), it looks festive, and it clearly indicates championship with the Henri Delaunay Cup smack in the middle.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/euro_2016_background.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for UEFA EURO 2016 by Brandia Central\" \/>\n<figcaption>Background.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/euro_2016_pitch.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for UEFA EURO 2016 by Brandia Central\" \/>\n<figcaption>&#8220;[The] stage: a football pitch as the epicenter of all celebration.

There is also a secondary graphic in the form of a 3D pitch with &mdash; guess what? &mdash; more wiggles and doodads. It&#8217;s a fun piece of illustration, if a little corny. The range of applications shown are brief but promising and indicate that there is more to be explored in how it all comes together. Overall, despite my initial averse reaction to such a caricatured approach, this identity looks like a heck of fun to do and to experience come 2016.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"In the amazingly distant past of 2009 we covered the design of the EURO 2012 identity (and its follow-up) designed by Lisbon-based Brandia Central, who have also designed the identity for EURO 2016.
