These aren&#8217;t your average cash prizes. Winners will choose from a variety of known printers to produce their passion project and Best in Show will receive the first-ever residency at Crane &amp; Co. in North Adams, Massachusetts. And unlike typical design contests, The Mohawk Show doesn&#8217;t corral artwork into arbitrary categories. Instead, any and all work made the past two years on Mohawk paper will be accepted and evaluated based on six criteria. The judges will look for:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Object Quality<\/li>\n<li>Material Quality<\/li>\n<li>Paper as the Fifth Color<\/li>\n<li>Pairing Texture<\/li>\n<li>Beauty<\/li>\n<li>Paper &amp; Process<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sponsored_mohawk_show_judges_a.jpg\" alt=\"Mohawk Paper wants to Fund your Passion Project\" \/>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Speaking of judges, entries will be evaluated by an eclectic, bright collection of design thinkers. Mohawk has lined up industry veterans and fresh faces who represent a spectrum of design thinking &#8212; and they&#8217;re ready to see your best work.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/327969583?title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"360\" height=\"203\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Learn more and get ready to submit your work <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mohawkconnects.com\/themohawkshow\" target=\"_blank\" onclick=\"ga('send', 'event', 'Click', 'Sponsored', 'Post', '0');\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a>.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Mohawk Paper is introducing a new kind of awards show.
