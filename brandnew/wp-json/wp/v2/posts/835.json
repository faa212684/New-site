Launched in 1995, it was acquired in 2007, along with other channels, by Turner Broadcasting System Latin America. This past April, it launched a new identity designed by Turner&#8217;s own Latin in-house design group based in Argentina, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.injaus.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">InJaus<\/a>.

I&#8217;m not sure I would be able to pinpoint what this new logo was for either, but the visual cues are much more evident: It&#8217;s more bubbly, more pop, more fluid&hellip; it just feels like it belongs to the channel much more. The letterforms are actually quite interesting, if just a little unrefined. And the holding shape, while trendy and overused, works pretty decently in this logo and also as a bubbling application. In one of the news items I was reading about it, it tried to explain that the new identity was about &#8220;generating heat,&#8221; so depending on your idea of visualizing heat generation this might be right on the spot. <\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately the HTV web site requires that you use Internet Explorer so, because this is not 1999 and Microsoft abandoned the OS X ship years ago, there is probably some information or visual application that I may be failing to provide. But I believe you get the gist.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Thanks to Diego G.
