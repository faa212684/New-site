Czech Ice Hockey is also responsible for the men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s national teams representing the country in international competitions, including the Olympics and although they haven&#8217;t won gold since 1998, they are historically considered one of the top hockey teams in the world. Recently, Czech Ice Hockey introduced a new identity designed by Prague-based <a href=\"http:\/\/go4gold.cz\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Go4Gold<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><p>A microsite with more information and images is available <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jakolev.cz\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<blockquote>The new dynamic logo is inspired by the lion which &#8211; as the country&#8217;s official symbol &#8211; has been present on the jerseys of Czech ice-hockey players for almost a hundred years. The logo&#8217;s coloring is based on the colors of the Czech national flag, and it is supplemented with &#8220;ice&#8221; shading. The lion is firmly connected with the puck, much as ice-hockey is associated with modern Czech history. The six spikes of the lion&#8217;s mane refer to six players on the ice, and if you take a closer look at the lion&#8217;s eye, you will discover the outline of the island of \u0160tvanice in Prague, which is were the Czechoslovaks won their first ever world championships.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/go4gold.cz\/czech-ice-hockey\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Go4Gold project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/czech_hockey_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Czech Ice Hockey by Go4Gold\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.

The sad puck in the depressing gray bar sealed its fate as a terrible logo. The new logo is more in tune with the growing Americanization of European sports logos, which is probably not our most popular export. Nonetheless, it&#8217;s undoubtedly a better logo visually and conceptually (perhaps a little heavy-handedly).<\/p>\n<p>The lion comes from the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/czech_hockey_coat_of_arms.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Czech Republic&#8217;s coat of arms<\/a> and its wagging tongue has been transformed into a hidden puck, which is kind of clever (but also kind of weird &#8212; I&#8217;ll beat someone to the punch and quip that the lion looks like it&#8217;s coughing the Nike swoosh). As a self-contained unit (or floating head) the icon is quite effective and can be used freely across applications. The wordmark is fine; perhaps feeling slightly heavy and static but let&#8217;s appreciate that it doesn&#8217;t have spikes and wisps to match the lion&#8217;s mane.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/czech_hockey_logo_lockups.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Czech Ice Hockey by Go4Gold\" \/>\n<figcaption>Lock-ups.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/czech_hockey_logo_system.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Czech Ice Hockey by Go4Gold\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo system.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The logo works great as a system and will certainly help consolidate the efforts of the organization and make it clear that they are the ones behind all things Czech ice hockey.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/czech_hockey_type.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Czech Ice Hockey by Go4Gold\" \/>\n<figcaption>Custom fonts by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.suitcasetype.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tom\u00e1\u0161 Brousil<\/a>.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Not much else to say about the custom fonts&#8230; They are fine but a little dry.
