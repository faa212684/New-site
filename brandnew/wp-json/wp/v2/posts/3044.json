The identity by Shenzhen, China-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/1983present\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1983 Present<\/a> is not a complete runaway hit and even the logo, which is what I am focusing on for this particular Like, isn&#8217;t perfect, starting with the typography. It&#8217;s almost great: the word &#8220;Ei8ht&#8221; looks groovy and mystical but the same typeface used small and extra tracked in &#8220;The Happy&#8221; doesn&#8217;t make <em>me<\/em> happy. However, the double-circle &#8220;8&#8221; shape with a solid color in the bottom and an ornate, gold illustration in the top is absolutely stunning and makes me happy eight times over. The layered feel and the vibrancy achieved against the bright colors is quite unique. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/The-Happy-8\/10109459\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Upstage by Studio Fusentast<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_upstage.jpg\" alt=\"Upstage by Studio Fusentast\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">As demonstrated yesterday by the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/new_logo_and_retail_look_for_denner_by_wirz.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Denner post<\/a>, not all sans-serifs-in-a-red-rectangle are created or praised equal (spoiler: it wasn&#8217;t well received). Here I think we have a good one, people! Designed by Oslo, Norway-based <a href=\"http:\/\/studiofusentast.no\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Studio Fusentast<\/a> the logo for Upstage, a production company specializing in the backstage details of large events, is an unassuming, airy sans serif inside a generously padded rectangle. Nothing out of the ordinary so far. In physical applications, though, the logo serves as a clever and playful device to highlight the importance of looking at what&#8217;s going on behind the scenes by showing only the arrow that points you to the back. No groupies allowed. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/Upstage-identity\/10094617\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Neurotrend by Vladimir Shlygin<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_neurotrend.jpg\" alt=\"Neurotrend by Vladimir Shlygin\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">This is probably one of the least wow-inducing overall identities posted in Friday Likes &mdash; the wordmark alone is cause for major concern &mdash; but, like Upstage above, the physical application turns it into something worth pointing out this Friday. Located in Moscow, <a href=\"http:\/\/neurotrend.ru\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Neurotrend<\/a> is a research center using neurological data and biometric data for advertising and marketing purposes so that clients can see what customers feel and how their brain reacts to the latest hashtag. A little <em>Clockwork Orange<\/em>-ish for my taste but let&#8217;s carry on. Local designer <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/vladimirshlygin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Vladimir Shlygin<\/a> used the way some medical gear visualizes data in the form of bended lines to create a well-formed visual language for Neurotrend but what takes the prize are the opportunities to reveal those bumps in the lines through embossing printed materials, creating that subtle bump in the lines to reveal specific forms. A very elegant solution. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/Neurotrend\/13803757\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"A combination of ornate, simple, and slightly weird make up this week&apos;s Friday Likes with work from Shenzhen, Oslo, and Moscow&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[818,633,873,309],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3044"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3044"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3044\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3044"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3044"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3044"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
