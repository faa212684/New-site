Swoosh is integrated into ONE, at the same time it highlights ONE. It refers to the fact Dow Jones is the number one publisher in the world. [&hellip;] We have developed a monogram based on the logotype in the need of flexible logo usages such as employee ID cards, application\/social network icons and new products &#038; services logos. The logo colors are black with energetic blue, which are very robust in order to convey the vitality and energy of editors, journalists and all workers of Dow Jones.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/studionewwork.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">STUDIO NEWWORK case study<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/dow_jones_logo_monogram.png\" alt=\"New logo and identity for Dow Jones by STUDIO NEWWORK\" \/>\n<figcaption>Monogram version.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/dow_jones_logo_explanation.png\" alt=\"New logo and identity for Dow Jones by STUDIO NEWWORK\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo structure.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/dow_jones_logo_one_words.png\" alt=\"New logo and identity for Dow Jones by STUDIO NEWWORK\" \/>\n<figcaption>Highlighting the word &#8220;ONE&#8221; in the name and putting it to use in sentences.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/dow_jones_stationery_concept.jpg\" alt=\"New logo and identity for Dow Jones by STUDIO NEWWORK\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stationery (prototype\/concept).<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/dow_jones_bizcard_concept.jpg\" alt=\"New logo and identity for Dow Jones by STUDIO NEWWORK\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business card (prototype\/concept).<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/dow_jones_newsletter_concept.jpg\" alt=\"New logo and identity for Dow Jones by STUDIO NEWWORK\" \/>\n<figcaption>Internal newsletter (prototype\/concept).<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">Despite the Verizon-esque swoosh, the old logo wasn&#8217;t too bad. It had decent typography, was well kerned, and the swoosh made it look news-y. The new logo maintains the weakest element of the old logo and amazingly turns it into the strongest element of the new one.  The swoosh has been embedded inside the letters that spell &#8220;ONE&#8221; and it&#8217;s perfectly aligned and structured to start with the angle of the &#8220;J&#8221; and end in the top bar of the &#8220;E&#8221;. It just works so well and so subtly. The wordmark is also a nice improvement with more gentle spacing, lighter weight, and no more italics than mash into each other. The verbal concept of using the swooshed &#8220;ONE&#8221; in sentences provides a simple mechanism to establish a brand language. In application &mdash; which all remains in the concept stage for now &mdash; everything looks nicely structured and laid out. Overall, it looks elegant and corporate as mofo. It doesn&#8217;t attempt to be cool or edgy and it&#8217;s all the better for it.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1882, Dow Jones &amp; Company &mdash; owned by News Corp since 2007 &mdash; is a &#8220;global provider of news and business information, delivering content to consumers and organizations.&#8221; Best known for its flagship publication, The Wall Street Journal,&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,36,26],"tags":[45,292,593,883,520],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2574"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2574"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2574\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2574"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2574"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2574"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
