I love me a good monoweight, chunky script and I appreciate this one even more by being awesome with only two letters. But what a perfect pair. As yet to be launched, my.com is a &#8220;brand for mobile apps and games&#8221; &mdash; whatever that may mean. In an interesting sharing of their process, my.com illustrates how they came to the logo through a combination of in-house work and outside firms, where Moscow-based <a href=\"http:\/\/ony.ru\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ONY<\/a> emerged with the winning concept. While the logo is pretty nice and the literal extensions with the icons are pleasing, there isn&#8217;t much to the identity. At least not yet. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/Mycom-Identity\/10980469\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Blue Goose Pure Foods by Sid Lee<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_bluegoose.jpg\" alt=\"Blue Goose Pure Foods by Sid Lee\"\/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">For <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bluegoosepurefoods.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Blue Goose<\/a>, a Canadian maker (grower? breeder?) of &#8220;high quality, clean protein (beef, chicken, and fish)&#8221;, Toronto-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sidlee.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sid Lee<\/a> created a stunning identity based around the inner-peace-inducing illustrations of Los Angeles, CA-based illustrator <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bioworkz.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ben Kwok<\/a> that have beautiful, scenic renderings that would make Kat Von D jealous. The illustrations serve as the driving element on the packaging and website, which is good because the umbilical-cord-ish look of the logo isn&#8217;t too appealing. But the overall typography and blue color palette are to die for. That&#8217;s what the cow, chicken, and fish said.

It&#8217;s sophistication at its best without delving into boring simplicity. The spiky typography makes you feel like the meat was sliced perfectly.
