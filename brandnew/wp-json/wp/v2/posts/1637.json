Now, still a Warburton-family-owned business, Warburtons employs 5,000 people working at 14 bakeries and 15 depots across the UK, producing over two million bakery products every day and, according to Nielson Data, it is the &#8220;second biggest grocery brand&#8221; in the UK. Warburtons&#8217; new logo <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thedrum.co.uk\/news\/2010\/11\/04\/16456-new-brand-identity-for-warburtons\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">was introduced<\/a> back in late 2010 but the complete brand rollout has taken most of 2011 to implement. The whole project was designed by London-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.smithandmilton.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Smith &amp; Milton<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/warburtons_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"Warburtons\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Of most redesigns we&#8217;ve seen this year, the previous mark for Warburtons is probably one of the nicest ones; not to say it&#8217;s perfect &mdash; the color combination is a little jarring and there might be too many shapes &mdash; but looking at it you can probably start imagining the smell of toasted bread in the morning. Although the new logo looks like nothing you would expect to see wrapped around a loaf of bread and would probably look better at the entrance of an amusement park, the wordmark works based on its equity and on the contextual fact that it, indeed, is wrapped around a loaf of bread, so there is no confusing it. The execution of the wordmark is pretty good too, with some character quirks in the right places, from the angled top of the &#8220;a&#8221; to the ligatures of the &#8220;r&#8221;s with their neighboring characters and the &#8220;t&#8221; hugging the &#8220;o&#8221;. It was all clearly well considered. I&#8217;m not sure orange as the main color is the best option, mainly because I associate orange with home improvement, but that&#8217;s my problem, not theirs.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Warburtons_Covers_2.jpg\" alt=\"Warburtons\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Warburtons_Spreads.jpg\" alt=\"Warburtons\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Warburtons_Trucks_1.jpg\" alt=\"Warburtons\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Warburtons_Engage2.jpg\" alt=\"Warburtons\" \/><\/p>\n<p>At the more corporate level, the logo works nicely with its playfulness emblazoned across big-ass trucks &mdash; there is a fun contrast about it. The use of playful typography and unexpected typeface choices make it work really well as a consumer brand, especially as seen in the packaging below. It&#8217;s interesting that they selected to use the logo on the bottom of the packaging as opposed to the standard of having it at the top, even more apparent in the chips packages. Overall, this is a great redesign that adapts really well across Warburtons&#8217; 75-plus range of products.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Warburtons_Packs_BA.jpg\" alt=\"Warburtons\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Warburtons_Packs_1.jpg\" alt=\"Warburtons\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Warburtons_Packs_2.jpg\" alt=\"Warburtons\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Warburtons_Packs_3.jpg\" alt=\"Warburtons\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Warb_Pitta_Chips_all5_640.jpg\" alt=\"Warburtons\" width=\"574\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Warburtons_Crumpets_4up_640_V2_1.jpg\" alt=\"Warburtons\" width=\"574\" \/><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_110913_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_110913_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_110913_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_110913_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,51,26],"tags":[108,41,53,33,228],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1637"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1637"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1637\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1637"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1637"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1637"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
