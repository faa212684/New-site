Their new identity, designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/blokdesign.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Blok Design<\/a> is a tight system that gives all the very different products a consistent shelf presence. It&#8217;s a super simple aesthetic of thin lines and a geometric sans serif (with a sprinkling of serif here and there) but all the proportions are just right with clear information and product names and a lovely, soft color palette. There are plenty more variations at the link that show what a nice, comprehensive system this is, ranging from rectangular to circular labels, blank to textured backgrounds, and a set of labels and tape for the prepared food packaging. I also like how they can turn up the volume on the coffee packaging and still maintain the look. <a href=\"http:\/\/blokdesign.com\/#\/client\/summerhill-market\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Villa Antoinette by Matthias Kronfuss<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_villaantoinette.jpg\" alt=\"Villa Antoinette by Matthias Kronfuss\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.villa-antoinette.at\/en\/main.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Villa Antoinette<\/a> is a luxury chalet in the Semmering region of Austria available for rent for a cool \u20ac1,500 a night because go look at it. The rental\/hotel&#8217;s identity has been designed by Vienna-based <a href=\"http:\/\/matthiaskronfuss.at\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Matthias Kronfuss<\/a>, all in a very pleasant and elegant Art Nouveau style that echoes the richness of the chalet and its environment. The identity could have maybe used a little extra push to not just be a rehashing of a style but everything is so nicely executed that I&#8217;ll hang my hat on it. <a href=\"http:\/\/matthiaskronfuss.at\/work\/villa-antoinette\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Candela by Infinito<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_candela.jpg\" alt=\"Candela by Infinito\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.candelaperu.net\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Candela<\/a> produces and retails sustainable, ethically-sourced products that highlight Peru&#8217;s offerings and honor the workers behind them &#8212; a value visualized by the new packaging designed by Lima-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.infinito.pe\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Infinito<\/a>. All the illustrations feature a pair of hands &#8212; the growers&#8217; and workers&#8217; &#8212; interacting with the ingredients of each product. The two-color illustrations work great against the consistent brown background and the gritty shading gives the packaging an earthy aesthetic, that provide a nice contrast for the minimalist, candle-shaped logo. I&#8217;m not sure the Art Deco font works in this context but it&#8217;s still nice enough. The illustrations win the day tho. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/51734233\/Candela\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"From minimalist to exuberant, we cover a satisfying range with work from Toronto, Vienna, and Lima&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[69,11,73,26],"tags":[663,633,39,53],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5418"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=5418"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5418\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=5418"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=5418"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=5418"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
