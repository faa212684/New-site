The last time <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/missing_person_benny_the_bellm.php\">we talked about Hotels.com<\/a> was in 2008 when two separate logos, one for the U.S. market and the other one for international sites, were introduced. Since then, Hotels.com has completely abandoned the bellhop mascot and adopted &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/media\/set\/?set=a.141706349204449.21610.112577918783959&#038;type=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SMART<\/a>&#8220;, a soul-patched claymation spokesperson that is not as annoying as he may seem at first glance. This month, Hotels.com has introduced a new logo.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>Colorful and bold, the new logo is a visually striking way of showcasing the hotels.com expertise and presence in the travel and hotel industries. The new &#8220;H&#8221; logo represents the abundance of choices hotels.com provides in destinations, hotel types, and price points.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/press.hotels.com\/en-us\/2012-02-14\/reinvigorating-the-hotels-com-brand\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press Release<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hotels_com_2012_logo_wordmark.png\" alt=\"Hotels.com\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hotels_com_2012_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"Hotels.com\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The previous logo seemed like a good concept &mdash; most hotels have an elevator with buttons for Up and Down &mdash; but the execution was as lackluster as it gets. The new logo strives for more points in the execution department trying to pull off a handful of visual tricks. Unfortunately they add up to a big mess. The layered &#8220;H&#8221; icon could have been interesting in a flat color rendition and some smart maneuvering of placement and overlays but instead we just get a literal stacking of &#8220;H&#8221;s with cheap rendering. The colors are pretty, though. The typography&hellip; oy vey. Why on earth would a &#8220;t&#8221; and &#8220;e&#8221; ever connect like that? The &#8220;c&#8221; and &#8220;o&#8221;, maybe, but when you look at it up close it&#8217;s not even resolved properly. The &#8220;c&#8221; just sticks itself into the &#8220;o&#8221;. It&#8217;s either a sans serif or it&#8217;s a script, but you can&#8217;t have it both ways, especially when it&#8217;s only less than 25% of the characters that are joined. Good execution can sometimes save misguided ideas &mdash; not the case here.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to Christian Peck for the tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_120215_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_120215_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_120215_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_120215_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,73,26],"tags":[491,40,42,54],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1838"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1838"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1838\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1838"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1838"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1838"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
