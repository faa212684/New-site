Quantcast offers a free analytics service, Quantcast Measure, that is used by over 100 million websites (which gives them a lot of data for their own service) and has built 17 data centers to process up to 30 petabytes of data a day. Earlier this month, Quantcast introduced a new logo designed by New York, NY-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jaegersloan.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">JaegerSloan<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>The new brand mark is both a Q and a measuring tape, to pay homage to our focus on measuring and understanding the full scope of what we do online. It now also becomes a clearer representation of the window we provide onto commerce and culture, captured in a series of custom-made animated patterns, which will unveil themselves through the year.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.quantcast.com\/blog\/the-art-and-science-of-quantcast\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Quantcast blog post<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/quantcast_logo_explanation.png\" alt=\"New Logo for Quantcast by JaegerSloan\" \/>\n<figcaption>Further logo explanation from their <a href=\"http:\/\/brand.quantcast.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">brand microsite<\/a>.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/quantcast_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo for Quantcast by JaegerSloan\" \/>\n<figcaption>Wordmark detail. Designed in collaboration with <a href=\"http:\/\/log.samarskaya.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ksenya Samarskaya<\/a><\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The previous logo was decent &mdash; very corporate &mdash; with one of the &#8220;a&#8221;s in the name replace by a &#8220;proportional to&#8221; (&#8733;) symbol which made it a nerdy reference. Even if you didn&#8217;t know what it meant (as was my case before I Googled it) it made the logo look like it was associated with formulas and maths. The new logo reflects Quantcast&#8217;s growth into relationships with popular web destinations like BuzzFeed, Gawker, TMZ, and Yelp, so its identity has to be more accessible and more consumer-friendly even as a B2B service. The primary logo is the wordmark and it doesn&#8217;t seem like it&#8217;s meant to be regularly locked up with the Q monogram. On its own, it&#8217;s a basic wordmark that is quite forgettable and has some dubious moves like the crossbar on the &#8220;t&#8221; being cut off on the first one but not the second one, the strange counterspace of the &#8220;q&#8221;, and the extra slope-y &#8220;a&#8221;s. So I guess that&#8217;s one too many grievances with it.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/quantcast_logo_animated_cars.gif\" alt=\"New Logo for Quantcast by JaegerSloan\" \/>\n<figcaption>Cars.

It makes for a good social media icon and I like the idea that it&#8217;s an analog measuring tape. The logo-as-window approach here is taken one step up by populating it with animated GIFs that are cool to look at even if sometimes the meaning isn&#8217;t quite clear. Overall, a good move to make Quantcast a more recognizable brand and bring it forward from behind the scenes&hellip; and maybe they can analyze the small data in our comments to figure out that non-matching &#8220;t&#8221;s aren&#8217;t cool.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 2006, Quantcast is a &quot;digital advertising company specialized in audience measurement and real-time advertising&quot; allowing marketers and advertisers to be highly targeted and specific in online advertising.
