Aside from its consumer retail operation, Staples works directly with companies through dedicated account teams to fulfill their office needs &#8212; something they have been building on more strongly since 2017 when private equity firm Sycamore Partners bought the company. Over the weekend, at its 2019 Sales Conference, Staples introduced a new identity.

It looks old now, though, maybe more so by its association to the struggling concept of brick-and-mortar retailers. The new logo takes the old staple, opens it up, and turns into a table, or at least that&#8217;s my interpretation based on the chair graphic used in multiple other places. It&#8217;s not&#8230; bad. It&#8217;s not great either but it gives them an icon to work with, something they didn&#8217;t have before. I find the logo more endearing if I think about it as a giant staple, which sometimes it still looks as such as long as there isn&#8217;t a chair behind it. The wordmark is decent, with a wider structure than the default geometric sans and relatively eccentric spur on the &#8220;a&#8221;. Combined, they make for a really wide logo but, again, it&#8217;s not bad.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/staples_usa_logo_with_canada.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Staples\" \/>\n<figcaption>U.S. and Canada versions.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>There is no real reason to bring up to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/new_logo_for_staples_canada.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Staples Canada<\/a> except that I want to because I find this so troubling. They are separate companies in separate countries but us and Canada are pretty close to each other that we sometimes go into the other&#8217;s territory and it&#8217;s just so weird to see the same company name executed in similar but different ways. Before each country&#8217;s Staples redesign at least they shared the same logo. I doubt customers in either country will be confused by this but it&#8217;s the kind of thing that jolts me awake at night from a nightmare, drenched in sweat, screaming &#8220;STAPLES HAS TWO LOGOS&#8221;.

I guess by now you can deduct that I was expecting this to all look bad &#8212; I should have just titled this review &#8220;Not bad&#8221;. I&#8217;m pleasantly surprised how well things look. It&#8217;s all, like, one round shy of being really good but it&#8217;s definitely not bombing &#8212; for the most part. The video below is a reminder that large corporations have a really bizarre understanding of what &#8220;cool&#8221; is.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/embed\/feed\/update\/urn:li:ugcPost:6517765629125156864\" height=\"475\" width=\"504\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo reveal video at the 2019 Sales Conference.

Old and out of date. This will help infuse their brand, and likely their stores, with a relatively fresh coat of paint. As with the Best Buy redesign, I question how effective it is to redesign with so many stores having a sign outside that will take years and thousands of dollars to replace. Still, with Staples placing more emphasis on its B2B operation, the redesign will have its biggest impact there.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1986, Staples is an office supply retailing corporation with more than 1,500 stores in North America.
