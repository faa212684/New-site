From their release:<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>Embracing the power and familiarity of the classic &#8220;R&#8221; (born in 1965), the new logo presents a strong, simple message: &#8220;This is made by Rossignol.&#8221; We want to emphasize that Rossignol&#8217;s products are made by people committed to perfection, and who have a deep understanding of the mountain lifestyle and environment. The &#8220;R&#8221; represents a unification of purpose, of direction and of reason.<\/blockquote>\n<p>The only lasting Rossignol logo I can remember involved a french colored rooster (unofficial logo below), which shows where the new &#8220;R&#8221; came from. I have no recollection of even seeing this previous drab &#8220;R&#8221; Rossignol logo in the marketplace &mdash; likely due to its generic, sports-logo-in-five-minutes approach. This was a much needed redesign, and while not perfect, cleans up its act and tips its hat to its own skiing heritage.
