Dieline is committed to supporting the advancement of the package design industry in all its forms.

Our platform grew to include Dieline Awards, our global package design competition, and Dieline Conference, our annual package design event. Dieline is the world&#8217;s most visited packaging design website, and it highlights the importance and value of packaging design for brands in today&#8217;s world.
