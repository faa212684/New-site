For many generations of kids, M&oacute;ra books have been part of their upbringing. Without a traditional logo, M&oacute;ra has simply been typesetting the company name in the same title typeface as whichever book or series its on. Budapest-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.zwoelf.hu\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Made by Zwoelf<\/a> has just finished a new identity for the publisher and a logo that will be emblazoned on 76,000 book covers yearly.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>The new identity is a strong mark that changes from book cover to book cover, from business card to business card. The idea behind the emblem was to present Mora&#8217;s &#8220;M&#8221; letter as two triangles, with a size and position that can be vary but only inside strict rules. We created a large number of variations for the M\ufffdra emblem, with each a little different, although always the same.<br \/>&mdash; Provided Materials<\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mora_publishing_01_all.jpg\" alt=\"M&oacute;ra Publishing Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mora_publishing_02_stationery.jpg\" alt=\"M&oacute;ra Publishing Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mora_publishing_03_catalog.jpg\" alt=\"M&oacute;ra Publishing Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mora_publishing_04_catalog.jpg\" alt=\"M&oacute;ra Publishing Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This identity strikes a nice balance of cutesy (with its primary colors and rounded forms) and edgy (with its OCR-A-ish monospace typeface). The logo is very simple and efficient with an icon that, deployed on so many books, is bound to become easily recognizable, even with all its permutations as they are not drastically different where they might create confusion. I think the general populace will just recognize the overall shape and lock-up of it and probably never realize there are a dozen different versions. The &#8220;M&#8221; abstraction on its own may be a little hard to infer, but since the name is right underneath, it&#8217;s a pretty easy read. I like the typeface quite a bit, as it adds some seriousness to the identity, avoiding the whole thing becoming totally childish with all that red-blue-yellow. I actually like the single-color version of the logo, as seen below, but I definitely appreciate the overall effort and result.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mora_publishing_05_book.jpg\" alt=\"M&oacute;ra Publishing Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mora_publishing_06_book.jpg\" alt=\"M&oacute;ra Publishing Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mora_publishing_07_book.jpg\" alt=\"M&oacute;ra Publishing Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mora_publishing_08_all.jpg\" alt=\"M&oacute;ra Publishing Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_120719_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_120719_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"285\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_120719_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_120719_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"285\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_120719_config_03.xml&#038;xyz=poll_120719_votes_03.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"285\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv3\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv3\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[63,12,26],"tags":[617,179,755,756],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2055"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2055"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2055\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2055"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2055"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2055"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
