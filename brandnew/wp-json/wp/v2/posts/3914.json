(Talk about an under-exploited range of businesses in need of design work!). The logo is set in a groovy mono typeface and the ampersand has a fish hiding in it &mdash; cute. But the real showstopper here is the wave pattern and color palette combination. The pattern is almost annoyingly simple but it&#8217;s use is really perfect, always applied in the same size regardless of object so that the pattern always connects. The dark gray and salmon color work very well together, making this the most sophisticated sushi joint on deck. <a href=\"http:\/\/bond-agency.com\/project\/sushi-co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project here<\/strong><\/a><\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Greg Sorensen by DIA<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_gregsorensen.gif\" alt=\"Greg Sorensen by DIA\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">Brooklyn, NY-based Fashion photographer <a href=\"http:\/\/gregsorensenphoto.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Greg Sorensen<\/a> now has a logo as chic as the subjects he photographs. Designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/dia.tv\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DIA<\/a>, the logo is an abstraction of the f-stop markers in a camera lens, one of the key mechanisms for any photographer. Without the animation, the concept is a little lost but the subtle rotating lines are animated on his website which are the main point of contact. I wish the type were something else than Helvetica (or something so close to it &mdash; that &#8220;R&#8221; is not quite Helvetica) but I know I&#8217;m in the minority here. Another great move in the identity (not shown in the images above but yes at the project link) is the grid used in the photo layouts that follows the vertical guides generated by the logo, tying everything neatly together with perfect exposure. (Sorry, photo puns are not my fort&eacute;). <strong><a href=\"http:\/\/dia.tv\/greg-sorensen\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Salvador Coffee by Co Partnership<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_salvadorcoffee.jpg\" alt=\"Salvador Coffee by Co Partnership\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.salvadorcoffee.com.au\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Salvador Coffee Roasters<\/a> is a coffee shop and roaster in Sydney, Australia, and their packaging used to look like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.urbanspoon.com\/rph\/70\/1604433\/947577\/sydney-salvador-coffee-espresso-bar-salvador-coffee-espresso-bar-photo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this<\/a>. Local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/co-partnership.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Co Partnership<\/a> took the existing structure of a basic craft bag and sticker with the specific roast to a whole new level. The kraft-colored bags are printed in one color with the roaster&#8217;s name, set in a chunky sans, and then each roast gets its own unique label rendered in a menagerie of slightly low-brow, slightly traditional, slightly quirky typographic styles, all tied together by the physical format. The result is a fun, flexible, affordable system that looks as tasty as I&#8217;m sure the coffee is. <a href=\"http:\/\/co-partnership.com\/project\/salvador\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"A broad range of styles and approaches this week, with work from Helsinki, New York, and Sydney&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[597,737,564],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3914"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3914"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3914\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3914"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3914"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3914"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
