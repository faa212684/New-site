I kind of liked the &#8220;morph&#8221; blob version as a static logo but I <em>really<\/em> liked the crazy stuff <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/follow-up_science_channel.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Imaginary Forces did for it in animation<\/a>. I don&#8217;t watch the Science channel so no idea how long that stuff lasted or if it had been sustainable for the past 5 years but what was clear was that it was science, maybe with a heavier hint of sci-fi than the programming supported, which is something the new logo addresses.<\/p>\n<p>Removing the sci-fi vibe helps differentiate it from competing channel SyFy (which does have the programming to support the name and said sci-fi vibe) and setting it up as more of a knowledge channel. Unfortunately, in the process, they have also stripped the logo off of any personality, leaving behind a cube silhouette with horsy typography. It&#8217;s not a bad logo in the sense that it has tremendous screen presence with a bold and clear imprint but it&#8217;s not a good logo in the sense that, well, it looks&#8230; bad. That &#8220;S&#8221; is somehow unpleasant and the wide opening of the &#8220;C&#8221; creates an odd counterspace. It&#8217;s a serviceable logo but kind of a bland bastion for science.<\/p>\n<blockquote>We&#8217;ve introduced four buckets into our Promo Package system. Each bucket is genre specific and includes two unique color palettes.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/siblingrivalrystudio.com\/science-channel-rebrand\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sibling Rivarly Studio project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/science_channel_2017_color_palette.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and On-air Look for Science by Sibling Rivalry Studio\" \/>\n<figcaption>Color palette.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>We&#8217;ve designed a set of science-inspired graphic elements and patterns based on the shape of the new logo. The patterns are used subtly over footage or solid backgrounds as an added layer of texture. They&#8217;re used as compositional details creating a rich graphic world where every shape relates back to the form of the logo.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/siblingrivalrystudio.com\/science-channel-rebrand\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sibling Rivarly Studio project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/science_channel_2017_graphic_element.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and On-air Look for Science by Sibling Rivalry Studio\" \/>\n<figcaption>Graphic elements.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/science_channel_2017_graphic_element.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and On-air Look for Science by Sibling Rivalry Studio\" \/>\n<figcaption>Graphic elements in use.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/science_channel_2017_type_system.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and On-air Look for Science by Sibling Rivalry Studio\" \/>\n<figcaption>Type system.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The visual language gets a slight boost from corner-y graphic elements but is not necessarily inspiring. The main typography &#8212; Avenir, I think &#8212; doesn&#8217;t help in making things any more interesting, looking out of place amidst all the science-y imagery. It almost looks like a college textbook cover.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/196529021?title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>New on-air look.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">In motion things get a tiny bit better (mostly because you can add motion to watching paint dry and it will be better), especially with the frosted effect when the logo takes on the imagery below it but distorts it ever so slightly. All the growing and repositioning cube effects feel obvious and expected. Like the logo, they are not bad but they are also not great. The one cool effect might be at the very end of the video, with the logo rotating into visibility, but that&#8217;s about it. Overall, with &#8220;science&#8221; as the backdrop for an identity &#8212; an identity that benefits from motion &#8212; this falls way short of the potential coolness it could achieve; if this were C-SPAN, it would be perfect but for a science channel it hardly blows my mind.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Launched in 1996, Science is a cable television channel owned by Discovery Communications that focuses, as its name implies, on science including but not limited to ufology, manufacturing, construction, technology, space, prehistory, and animal science.
