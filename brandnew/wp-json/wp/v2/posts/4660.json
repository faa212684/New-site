This week, Appy Fizz introduced new packaging and brand campaign designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sagmeisterwalsh.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sagmeister &amp; Walsh<\/a> featuring Bollywood star (and current protagonist in ABC&#8217;s <em>Quantico<\/em>) <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Priyanka_Chopra\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Priyanka Chopra<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/appy_fizz_existing.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging and Brand Campaign for Appy Fizz by Sagmeister &amp; Walsh\" \/>\n<figcaption>Old packaging line-up.

For an old TV spot, especially if you are curious about what an anthropomorphous soda bottle would look like, see <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Z94ndsaO8Jo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a><\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old look was barely okay but mostly it lacked refinement, although I&#8217;m not sure the expectations of a fizzy apple drink whose mascot is a talking\/walking bottle of its own product should be too high. The strangest thing perhaps is the relatively elegant black label that envelopes the bottle that gives a brief peek into the product coupled with an apple-slash-speech bubble graphic. It&#8217;s almost as if the company had designed the bottle and label for a line of entry-level champagne but then they changed their mind and did the fizzy apple. Anyway, the old look is out and in its place is an explosion of color, balls, and fizz.<\/p>\n<blockquote>The new Appy Fizz identity visualizes carbonated bubbles through a dynamic graphic language of 3d spheres and circles. From the print campaign to the television commercial, this circular language in the bold red\/white\/black color palette unites the various mediums with a distinct look and feel. We worked with brand ambassador &amp; Bollywood star Priyanka Chopra for the TVC to create a bold film for Appy Fizz. In the film Priyanka &#8220;sheds&#8221; the sweeter tone of the brand&#8217;s past for a strong, bold, sexier tone that will continue for future campaigns.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.sagmeisterwalsh.com\/work\/project\/appy-fizz\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sagmeister &amp; Walsh project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/appy_fizz_new_lineup.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging and Brand Campaign for Appy Fizz by Sagmeister &amp; Walsh\" \/>\n<figcaption>New packaging line-up.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/appy_fizz_packaging_detail.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging and Brand Campaign for Appy Fizz by Sagmeister &amp; Walsh\" \/>\n<figcaption>Packaging detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The new packaging keeps the same bottles and cans but the graphics now have the refinement I was yearning for in the second paragraph. The main &#8220;FIZZ&#8221; lettering is basically the same as the old one but without all the extraneous shading and just a little bit wider spacing between the letters for better readability. The apple has been reduced to a lovely accent on top of the FIZZ lettering and &#8220;APPY&#8221; has gone from a cartoon-like font to a more charming hand-written approach. It&#8217;s amazing how the perceived value of the product changes with the right design. Paired with the large black label, it feels like a premium product.<\/p>\n<p>For the brand campaign, there is A TON of images and videos on Sagmeister &amp; Walsh&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sagmeisterwalsh.com\/work\/project\/appy-fizz\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">project page<\/a> and I&#8217;ve only posted a few of them here, so if you feel like you want or need to see more, there is more.

Oh, and Priyanka Chopra. Lots and lots of Priyanka Chopra. The combination of elements and the graphic interpretation of apples and fizz as red balls with polka dots is insanely fun and a visual treat that breaks with convention. Nothing on the market (in India or Europe or the U.S.) has, pardon the pun, this <a href=\"http:\/\/www.urbandictionary.com\/define.php?term=Balls%20out\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">balls out<\/a> approach. It&#8217;s a more-is-more-is-more approach that establishes an unmistakeable identity for the product while weirdly and abstractly communicating the essence of what the product is. I could do without the testicle innuendo (in the spot, where she says &#8220;You guys need more balls&#8221; and the &#8220;The Drink with Balls&#8221; video on S&amp;W&#8217;s page) as it really doesn&#8217;t need to go there but that may be a kind of sass that remains from the old campaign. Overall, this is a fantastic, fun, effervescent brand world that S&amp;W have created for Appy Fizz that elevates its presence and appeal. Also, Priyanka Chopra.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Introduced in 2005, Appy Fizz is a sparkling apple juice drink available in India.
