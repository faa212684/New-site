With 155,000 employees working in 77 countries, ThyssenKrupp is organized in six business areas: Components Technology, Elevator Technology, Industrial Solutions, Materials Services, Steel Europe and Steel Americas. Late last year, the company introduced a new identity, <strike>most likely designed in-house<\/strike> designed by Hamburg, Germany-based <a href=\"http:\/\/loved.de\/de\/content\/thyssenkrupp\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Loved<\/a>*, and insists on being referred to in all lowercase as thyssenkrupp. A very thorough <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thyssenkrupp.com\/brand\/en\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">microsite<\/a> explains the rebranding.<\/p>\n<p>* Additional credits include: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thjnk.de\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">thjnk<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mckinsey.de\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">McKinsey&amp;Company<\/a>, and thyssenkrupp in-house design team.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>The new signet brings together the Krupp rings and the Thyssen arch.

In other words, the logo and claim embody our corporate identity.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thyssenkrupp.com\/brand\/en\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brand microsite<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/thyssenkrupp_logos_original.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for thyssenkrupp by Loved\" \/>\n<figcaption>For reference: the individual logos before the companies merged.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/thyssenkrupp_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for thyssenkrupp by Loved\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>It may be hard to believe but, yes, the old logo was officially the refrigerator-badge looking thing on the left of the header image. When your logo has two holding shapes inside one holding shape, you know it&#8217;s time to redesign. If there was any benefit to the old logo it&#8217;s that it hinted at steel with its texture. The new logo maintains the equity of the arch and rings from the original companies but now integrates them in a much more interesting way and they are metaphorically in sync whereas before the arches simple sat over the rings and you could argue it wasn&#8217;t a <em>true<\/em> merger of logos.<\/p>\n<p>The new logo&#8217;s minimal approach is fitting for the times, dropping extraneous graphic baggage picked up during the late 1990s and early 2000s. The drawing is simple and to the point, yielding a space-age-like symbol that looks like serious engineering stuff takes place there. The wordmark uses a lighter version (or maybe a custom modification for this use) of its proprietary typeface, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.swisstypedesign.ch\/schriftfamilie\/415\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TKType<\/a>, designed by Dalton Maag in 1999. Going to an all lowercase approach doesn&#8217;t seem right for such a massive company but I guess it helps signal that this is not a merged company anymore but a unified one and, hey, it looks cool. Bonus points for matching the thickness of the letters and the icon, making it feel connected.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/thyssenkrupp_livery.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for thyssenkrupp by Loved\" \/>\n<figcaption>Truck livery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/thyssenkrupp_grill.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for thyssenkrupp by Loved\" \/>\n<figcaption>Some kind of grill.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/thyssenkrupp_escalator.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for thyssenkrupp by Loved\" \/>\n<figcaption>Just, you know, an electric escalator being hurtled through the air.

Just swaths of blue and the custom font repeating the tagline, also force-fed in lowercase despite the existence of periods in it. (Side rant: tag lines following the Word-period-Word-period-Word-period structure are as clich\u00e9&eacute; as swooshes &mdash; it&#8217;s like no one could figure out how to write a complete sentence and just threw the key words in there.) Overall, this is a very positive redesign, simply because it takes the logo from a trite execution to a possibly timeless one, but ThyssenKru&hellip; er, thyssenkrupp went maybe one step too far in making the company feel approachable and friendly, when a good uppercase letter here and there would have helped establish some clarity on who&#8217;s the boss when it comes to steelin&#8217;.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1999 after the merger of Thyssen AG and Krupp (but with roots as far back as the early 1800s), thyssenkrupp is a multinational, diversified industrial group that, in essence makes massive, complicated stuff with steel (including steel itself)&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,36,26],"tags":[292,683,133,1231],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4441"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4441"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4441\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4441"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4441"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4441"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
