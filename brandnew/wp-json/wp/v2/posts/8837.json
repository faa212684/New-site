It will tell their stories on the desire to succeed, the peaks and valleys and being more than a visible minority in one of the largest industries in the world &#8211; Design. We&#8217;re wanting to speak with creatives from Graphic Design, Industrial Design, Interior Design, Architecture, Fashion, Advertising, Illustration or Photography. Those who are willing to share their stories and their insights on how and what it took to continue to do what they enjoy as a profession.<\/p>\n<p>If you, or know someone who would like to share their story, please get in touch:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:michael@brainmetaldesign.com\">Email<\/a><br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/brainmetaldesign\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Instagram<\/a><br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/michael-sinanan-3336a86\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LinkedIn<\/a><br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/profile.php?id=100007225607306\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Facebook<\/a><\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/All_Color_Is_01.jpg\" alt=\"&lt;em&gt;All Colour Is&lt;\/em&gt;\" \/>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>From the moment we were tearing through our first set of crayons, we knew we were creative and we knew we were different. Our challenges are and have been both both internal and external. From looking to be taken seriously and seen with respect to how we worked our way through design school, jobs and our relationships with superiors, colleagues, friends and even family. However, how would the world be able to see us if we couldn&#8217;t even see ourselves in the world? What we BIPOC Creatives also share is the unique experience of not having certain opportunities and not occupying certain creative spaces because we have what the majority of individuals in creative industries do not &#8211; a darker shade of pale. Yet in spite of this uphill battle we continue to find the joy and purpose as Creatives.<\/blockquote><h3>Michael Sinanan, director<\/h3>\n<p><strong>To learn about how this project came to be, you can read <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/pulse\/fade-black-michael-sinanan\/?trackingId=LtTsJk1LQZqQkAvl2uuORg%3D%3D\" target=\"_blank\" onclick=\"ga('send', 'event', 'Click', 'Sponsored', 'Post', '0');\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this post<\/a>.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>Ed.&#8217;s Note:<\/em> This post (and the banner ad you will see on Brand New) are being provided free of charge to the initiative.
