The name, identity, and user interface were designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.movingbrands.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Moving Brands<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/io_me_world_graphic.png\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for iO by Moving Brands\" \/>\n<figcaption>Meaning behind the name.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The service principles immediately guided the naming process. iO is taken from the name of Jupiter&#8217;s closest moon. The i represents the individual and the O the individual&#8217;s world &mdash; and together they suggest the close proximity of the two.<br \/><br \/>As with the name, the mark expresses simplicity, with the individual symbolised by the i, and the individual&#8217;s world by the O. The i is taken from the Swisscom wordmark, with the use of the Swisscom serif typeface strengthening the relationship between master brand and service brand. The agile, vibrant character of the O animates intelligently to bring life, motion and vibrancy to the mark.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.movingbrands.com\/work\/keeping-your-world-simple-secure-and-close\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Moving Brands case study<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/io_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for iO by Moving Brands\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>We built generative design into the heart of the project, experimenting and sketching in code from the outset. The outcome was bespoke software to generate an endless array of vibrant imagery to be used in applications across the brand. This supporting graphic language utilises crops of the colour gradients found within the O symbol, offering rich visual textures ideal for screen and print platforms.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.movingbrands.com\/work\/keeping-your-world-simple-secure-and-close\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Moving Brands case study<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/io_patterns.png\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for iO by Moving Brands\" \/>\n<figcaption>Color gradient crops.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/io_system.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for iO by Moving Brands\" \/>\n<figcaption>Identity elements.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">The only thing that keeps me from fully liking the name is its proximity to &#8220;iOS&#8221; which  is too much in the same airspace as the app. Other than that, it&#8217;s a short, simple name with a good concept and story behind it. The logo is okay, there is nothing transcendental about it and it&#8217;s well justified with the use of Swisscom&#8217;s &#8220;i&#8221; and a loading-y, swoopy &#8220;O&#8221;. As usual, with Moving Brands projects, the fun is in the applications and supporting elements. This time, it&#8217;s a party of concentric gradients that reveal their banded color transitions, making it all a little more lively than just regular gradients would do. The system is colorful, saturated, and springy in application. More interesting about this is the amount of branding firepower put into an app &mdash; you can&#8217;t just design rounded-edge icon and call it a day.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/io_iphone_screens.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for iO by Moving Brands\" \/>\n<figcaption>The iO app.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"http:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/71439343?portrait=0&amp;color=ffff01\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Video summarizing the project, from concept to completion.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"http:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/71438677?portrait=0&amp;color=ffff01\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Introduction to iO.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"http:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/71438278?portrait=0&amp;color=ffff01\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Brand film.
