The Hall is a Grade I Listed building; it has been in continuous use since it was opened in March 1871. It was always conceived as a multipurpose building to host not only concerts but exhibitions, public meetings, scientific conversations and award ceremonies. It is a registered charity held in trust for the nation but is financially self-sufficient: it receives no funding from central or local government.&#8221;<\/p><!--more--><figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/120169320?title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo introduction and animation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/royal_albert_hall_tote.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Royal Albert Hall by BrandPie\" \/>\n<figcaption>Tote.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/royal_albert_hall_ticket.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Royal Albert Hall by BrandPie\" \/>\n<figcaption>Ticket.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/royal_albert_hall_champagne.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Royal Albert Hall by BrandPie\" \/>\n<figcaption>Champagne bucket and flute.
