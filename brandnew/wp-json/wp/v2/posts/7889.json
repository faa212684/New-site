All typeset in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.myfonts.com\/fonts\/parachute\/pf-handbook-pro\/regular\/?refby=ucllc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PF Handbook Pro<\/a> and printed on red paper flooded with a lot of black, the applications are absolutely striking.

The packaging, designed by Sydney, Australia-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.squadink.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Squad Ink<\/a>, isn&#8217;t revolutionary but it hits all the right notes for a feel-good brewery and is a nice respite from the super-weird-aesthetic of recent microbreweries. Wordmark is nice, pattern is nice, little badge is nice, color palette is nice. It&#8217;s simply a pleasant packaging system with enough nice details to make you long for a nice cold beer this Friday.
