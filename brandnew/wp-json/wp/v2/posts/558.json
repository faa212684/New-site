As a designer, it&#8217;s one of the few products I think of when I hear &#8220;consumerism.&#8221; I have this picture in my head of all the products looking the same up and down the aisles &mdash; it&#8217;s quite terrifying. Oh wait, it&#8217;s no picture in my head, it&#8217;s reality.<\/p><!--more--><p><img alt=\"cheer.gif\" src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cheer_asile.jpg\" alt=\"Cheer Aisle\" \/>\n<span class=\"small\"><strong>The Detergent Aisle, aka The Land of Conformity.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Add another to the pile of ambiguity. Cheer tried to update its image but produced a half-baked attempt, with a logo that is not distinct enough from the old and much less, well, distinct at all. They updated the logo on their <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cheer.com\">website<\/a> but apparently couldn&#8217;t photograph their new packaging. The new look keeps the rainbow colors of the old but gets rid of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.myfonts.com\/fonts\/fontbureau\/bodega-sans\/\">bodega sans-like<\/a> type treatment. The new extended type is still highly forgettable.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cheer_bottles.jpg\" alt=\"Cheer Bottles, Before and After\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cheer_new_bottles.jpg\" alt=\"Bottles on the aisle\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>New bottles.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t quite get why Cheer took such a lateral (almost backwards) move when redesigning their packaging. Ultimately the packaging should stand out yet keep some brand equity. When I walk up and down the aisle, I know exactly what to grab based on the shape of the package and color. I wish Cheer would have taken a bolder step and branched out beyond the standard &#8220;clean&#8221; look.<\/p>\n<p>I still am stunned as to why stores don&#8217;t operate more like the <a href=\"http:\/\/wdw.com\/werks\/index.asp?brand=Mrs+Meyer%27s+Clean+Day&#038;id=40\">Mrs. Meyer&#8217;s brand<\/a>, by <a href=\"http:\/\/wdw.com\/\">Werner Design Werks<\/a>. Such a novel concept to lump all your needs into one area. It would save me a good thirty minutes walking up and down each aisle in the store.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":15,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,51,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/558"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/15"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=558"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/558\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=558"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=558"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=558"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
