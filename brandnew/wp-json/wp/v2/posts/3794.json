Headquartered in Vernier, Switzerland, Givaudan employs over 9,000 people across 88 locations and 34 production sites worldwide. Recently, the company introduced a new identity designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/interbrand.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Interbrand<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/givaudan_old_logo.png\" alt=\"New Identity for Givaudan by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Old logo. The elements are the same now, they&#8217;ve just been broken up.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>Without us knowing it, Givaudan (leader of the flavor and fragrance industry) touches us every day through our favorite perfumes, soaps, and snacks. Ubiquitous but invisible, Givaudan&#8217;s presence needed to be recognized and better defined. Since the brand&#8217;s competitors tend to focus on innovations in the lab, we felt Givaudan had an opportunity to differentiate by emphasizing emotional connection over technical know-how. Stressing the importance of special scents and tastes in enhancing self-expression and personal experiences, we developed a new proposition that captures the sensuousness and creative spirit behind the Givaudan brand: &#8220;Enjoy the essence. Express yourself.&#8221; Putting the sensory experience front and center, we conveyed this sentiment across all brand touchpoints.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/interbrand.com\/en\/work\/70\/making-the-invisible-visible\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Interbrand project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/givaudan_design_elements.jpg\" alt=\"New Identity for Givaudan by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Design elements.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The icon and wormdark remain the same as before but have been separated in order to make the &#8220;G&#8221; monogram the star of the show by isolating it against fields of black and using it as a window for all kinds of allusive imagery. It&#8217;s nothing we haven&#8217;t seen before but it certainly transforms Givaudan into much more of a lifestyle brand and name that consumers should be aware of. The images inside the logo aren&#8217;t the most imaginative or offer much new in the logo-as-window approach but it&#8217;s a tried-and-true approach.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/givaudan_launch_event.jpg\" alt=\"New Identity for Givaudan by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>New logo launch event.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/givaudan_ad.jpg\" alt=\"New Identity for Givaudan by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Ad.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/givaudan_online.jpg\" alt=\"New Identity for Givaudan by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Online presence.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/givaudan_shopping_bags.jpg\" alt=\"New Identity for Givaudan by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Shopping bags.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/118023599\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>New identity introduction.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/118106909?color=4b9265&#038;title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Some process on the making of the new identity.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">Google-Images-ing &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=givaudan&#038;lr=lang_en&#038;biw=1339&#038;bih=866&#038;tbs=lr:lang_1en&#038;source=lnms&#038;tbm=isch&#038;sa=X&#038;ei=8RTrVN_SLrT_sASHioC4CA&#038;sqi=2&#038;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Givaudan<\/a>&#8221; displays a very clinical and corporate aesthetic in its ads and banners.
