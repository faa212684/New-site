Zinc is provided by WorldPay, a UK alternative to PayPal that has been around since 1994, and is trying to compete with the latter&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.paypal.com\/webapps\/mpp\/credit-card-reader\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Here<\/a> device that also entered the UK market this year.

It&#8217;s clever, graphic, and completely unexpected for the device and the online payment industry. The question is: how long can this last? At what point does the exploding pigment visual become too much or too much of the same in application? Right now, at launch, it looks and feels great but my guess is that it will have to evolve or change dramatically in the next two to three years to stay interesting. The other thing that struck me is how more graphically sophisticated the identity is to the actual device, which looks like an old calculator and is as attractive as a 1997 Nokia phone.
