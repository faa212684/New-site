Gone is the barber-stripe-clad moire mouthful, &#8220;New Museum of Contemporary Art.&#8221;<\/p><!--more--><p>An informant from the design team articulated the organizing principle. <blockquote>&#8220;&#8230;we have taken the concept of what a museum is, in a sense a platform\/container of art and applied that idea to the identity using language.&#8221;<\/blockquote> <\/p>\n<p>Message is the medium in the program created by Wolff Olins and friends*. With the brand principle &#8220;New Art, New Ideas,&#8221; informative, entertaining, and provocative messages serve to cohesively expose and build on the mission of the institution with a rigorous brevity. For a museum with no permanent collection, all this interchangeable newness makes a lot of sense. The museum&#8217;s imperative is to scream &#8220;come one come all&#8221; to this new art high-rise on the historically gritty Bowery; home of flooring, ramekins, Julia Stiles&#8217; condo, and the remnants of CBGB&#8217;s awning.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"new_0a.jpg\" src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/new_0a.jpg\" width=\"470\" height=\"120\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"new_1.jpg\" src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/new_1.jpg\" width=\"470\" height=\"301\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The 235 Bowery message is used as the default logo as a practical ends to incessantly remind the uninitiated where the new art and ideas are. Sadly, an address number is an abstract thing in a city whose colloquial directional logic operates first in cross-streets, and second in building numbers. Regardless, one can&#8217;t argue with the new brick and mortar, as it were. Speaking of, <a href=\"http:\/\/nymag.com\/arts\/architecture\/reviews\/41267\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>New York<\/em> Magazine<\/a> has a solid review of the architecture by the Tokyo firm, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.designboom.com\/eng\/interview\/sanaa.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SANAA<\/a>, and <a href=\"http:\/\/gothamist.com\/2007\/11\/29\/a_preview_of_th.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gothamist<\/a> has some hot detail shots of the lovely bathrooms and exterior wall details. Particularly welcoming is the sign installation on the exterior by Ugo Rondinone which shouts a rainbowed &#8220;Hell Yes&#8221; to the Bowery.<\/p>\n<p>Besides giving the requisite what and where, non-sequitur quips pop up now and then to remind us that it&#8217;s a cool, accessible place with a newly self-aware personality. My favorites are &#8220;New Forget It Museum&#8221;, &#8220;New Celebrity Museum&#8221; and the &#8220;New I Could&#8217;ve Done This Museum&#8221;. As a whole, the system conveniently bundles the concept of curatorial, cultural, and interpretive flexibility with the museum&#8217;s angsty, anti-bourgeois, punky downtown heritage. At times though, the sentiment becomes ambivalent and sarcastic&hellip; from a tired hand at a dry-erase board in a brainstorming session on Madison avenue.<\/p>\n<p>Poster-sniping throughout the city for the launch campaign was prolifc and memorable, second only to <a href=\"http:\/\/select.nytimes.com\/2006\/01\/18\/nyregion\/18about.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dr. Zizmor&#8217;s<\/a> ongoing-takeover of New York subway adspace. Curiously, recent Radiohead snipings for &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/flickr.com\/search\/?q=inrainbows%20posters&#038;w=all\">In Rainbows<\/a>&#8221; are pretty darn similar.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"new_2.jpg\" src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/new_2.jpg\" width=\"470\" height=\"301\" \/>       <\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"new_x.jpg\" src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/new_x.jpg\" width=\"470\" height=\"301\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Type is employed at a scale which softens the belligerent all caps house-style between fields of flat black. The post-Eurostile\/Microgramma typeface, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fontshop.com\/fonts\/singles\/monotype\/neographik\/\">Neographik<\/a>, lends a touch of sci-fi, high-tech irony. Thankfully, it is less sober than MoMA&#8217;s Gothic, and somehow feels more timeless. Custom typography results in the museum&#8217;s collateral materials passing the &#8220;glance and you know where&#8217;s it from&#8221; test. Moreover, the type is dressed in eclectic colors that collapse the sophisticated palettes of Paul Rand in the mid 50s and Esprit in the late 80s. Besides forging a tight appearance, the stacked and varied arrangements of type create pleasantly haphazard rags which feel very similar to the asymmetrical shape of the building. <\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"new_4.jpg\" src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/new_4.jpg\" width=\"470\" height=\"301\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"new_5.jpg\" src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/new_5.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"320\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"new_6.jpg\" src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/new_6.jpg\" width=\"470\" height=\"301\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Aesthetic merits of the architecture will be experienced by visitors in context; as a metaphor for containers, galleries, and tenements; however, silhouettes of the building awkwardly decorate some materials. When the jagged rectangular shape is hijacked for use on banners and posters, it loses all scale and subtlety, feeling like a poorly conceived retail product &mdash; an unborn <a href=\"http:\/\/www.zune.net:80\/en-US\/products\/accessories\/default.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Zune<\/a> accessory or the cousin to Amazon&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Kindle-Amazons-Wireless-Reading-Device\/dp\/B000FI73MA\/uc-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kindle<\/a>. But in contrast to all this forced logic, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_17_sides_of_a_cultural_ide.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Casa Da Musica<\/a> successfully utilizes its container shape to offer a visual equivalent of the audio experience by way of using the impermeable concert hall&#8217;s silhouette as a vehicle for describing events with multifaceted experiences. The much hyped CK <a href=\"http:\/\/youtube.com\/watch?v=nIW-ElJzm0w<br \/>\n&#8221; target=&#8221;_blank&#8221;>graf billiboard takeover video<\/a> in advance of the opening, feels overdone. A street-cred stunt like this would only be required if the New Museum was misplaced in Murray Hill. The new language system is not an entirely new idea&hellip; flash back to 2005 when Seigel &#038; Gale got there first with their naming system for the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.commarts.com\/CA\/exhibit\/082905\/<br \/>\n&#8221; target=&#8221;_blank&#8221;>Parsons the New School for Design<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>So far, the expressions of the New Museum identity are striking and distinctive in achieving a coherence between mission, building, and identity. Modularity and user-controlled elements have transcended fashion and now appear as a requirement of identity design in contrast to the slick and straight-faced management style modernism of yore. Yet, unlike the flexibility of the seizure-inducing pizzazz of the the 2012 logo, this brutal program demonstrates a measured and seductive pragmatism. We can surely look forward to even newer flexible identities in 2008.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"new_led.jpg\" src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/new_led.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"320\" \/><\/p>\n<p>*Expanded credits for the identity program are:<br \/>\nIdentity concept: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wolffolins.com\/\">Wolff Olins<\/a>\nDesign development: Wolff Olins, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.omnivorous.org\/\">Omnivore<\/a>, <br \/>\nand the New Museum in-house design department<br \/>\nAdvertising: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.droga5.com\/\">Droga 5<\/a><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":8,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,63,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/574"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/8"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=574"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/574\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=574"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=574"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=574"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
