(A little confusing, I know). This comes at a time when &#8220;the business of sports is finally being taken seriously&#8221; as venturethree writes <a href=\"http:\/\/www.venturethree.com\/blog\/article\/a-golden-future-for-sports\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">in a great blog post<\/a> explaining the current state of professional sports in India and the opportunities for companies to be involved in a meaningful way. Yesterday Star Sports launched its new unified brand designed by London-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.venturethree.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">venturethree<\/a> who worked with Why Projects on the brand positioning and with Los Angeles, CA-based <a href=\"http:\/\/capacity.tv\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Capacity<\/a> to help develop the on-screen packaging for all five channels.<\/p><!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/StarSports_Previous_star_logos.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and On-air Look for Star Sports by venturethree\" \/>\n<figcaption>Other logos done by venturethree for Star TV including Star India, Star Jalsha, and Star Plus.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The philosophy of the new Star Sports brand is to inspire the hero in every sports fan. Brand strategist and venturethree partner Verity Evans said &#8220;Star Sports will deliver on this promise by changing the TV and sports landscape in India. Aiming to socialize new sports in India, to bring India high-quality local language coverage and commentary and to raise the quality of sports broadcasting in the region. It&#8217;s the start of a sports revolution.&#8221;<br \/><br \/>&#8220;In creating the new brand we were not looking to position Star Sports in relation to other sports broadcasters, but to place it firmly in the world of the greatest sports brands.&#8221; said Stuart Jane, creative director and partner at venturethree.<\/blockquote><h3>Provided press release<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/StarSports_Logo_detail.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and On-air Look for Star Sports by venturethree\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/StarSports_Logos_all.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and On-air Look for Star Sports by venturethree\" \/>\n<figcaption>Family of logos for each channel.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Out of context and just reading the name, <em>Star<\/em> Sports, you might think &#8220;Yeah, it&#8217;s called Star Sports and it has a star, what&#8217;s the big whoop?&#8221; but as part of the larger Star TV family of logos this fits nicely in with them but with a much more energetic and flamboyant aesthetic. The static logo isn&#8217;t that impressive either without looking at how it animates and how the trails of light in the shooting star structure are used in the on-air package. Obviously, this logo lives on TV and constantly animated, which is where it really stands out and serves as a striking signature to the channel.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/78645179?portrait=0&amp;color=ffffff\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Tease of on-air look.

The black backgrounds add a good sense of drama that goes very well with the new network&#8217;s ambitions to create new heroes for the people of India. Overall, the new identity has a good balance of showmanship graphics and hardcore sports attitude.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Broadcasting under slightly different guises in India since 1993 and managed by Star Sports (itself managed by Star TV), Star Sports India is now launching as a unified network of sports channels that will see popular channels like Star Cricket&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,66,26],"tags":[386,290,121,429,537],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2841"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2841"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2841\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2841"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2841"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2841"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
