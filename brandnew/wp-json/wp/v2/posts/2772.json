The curves represent the permanent link we want to create between people, organizations. They include and highlight POST name. Visually dynamic, the emblem also represents the diversity of our converged solutions. In perpetual motion, it recalls the opening, another core value of our Group. The typography is resolutely modern, while remaining consistent with our traditions. This specific design is typography specially chosen. The imposing characters were chosen to support our commitment to serve our clients without discrimination, but also to achieve our goals remain the leading telecom and postal operator in Luxembourg and become a leading player in the financial sector.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www2.post.lu\/fr\/notre_nouvelle_identite\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Identity explanation mini site (Google-translated)<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/post_luxembourg_logo_divisions.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Name for POST Luxembourg by Minale Design Strategy\" \/>\n<figcaption>POST divisions.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/post_luxembourg_image_thing.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Name for POST Luxembourg by Minale Design Strategy\" \/>\n<figcaption>Um, a thing.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/68473126?portrait=0&amp;color=ffffff\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Identity presentation. Most of the work can be seen in this video that shows a lot of prototypes and the visual language (static and animated).<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Neither of the two previous logos inspired much awe. P&amp;T used the horn typically associated with European postal services and a retina-challenging color palette. LuxGSM had an almost-interesting techno vibe going for it, but the triple bubble icon was a bit too weird. The new logo is something that we are all probably supposed to hate at first glance. I mean, it&#8217;s a giant yellow swoosh cradling two ovals and featuring some trendy overlays and a very slight gradient. But, either I&#8217;m getting soft, or this is actually not <em>that<\/em> bad. There is a certain dynamism achieved quite well that is always the failing point of most swoosh- and overlay-based logos but this one pulls it off &mdash; specially in application where, the identity elements by themselves seem equally ill fitted to work but come together quite competently.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/post_luxembourg_livery.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Name for POST Luxembourg by Minale Design Strategy\" \/>\n<figcaption>Livery.
