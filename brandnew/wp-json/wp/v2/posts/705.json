And it recently unveiled a new identity designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/thebrandunion.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Brand Union<\/a> that is as much about moving the service provider forward as it is about mimicking what other brands have already done: Kodak, Xerox, AT&amp;T, Ericsson, blah, blah, blah.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>The new symbol depicts a world that is calm and confident on the outside, whilst warm and vibrant on the inside. In creating a symbol that is separated from the brand name, the new logo works better online and on some emerging payment tools such as mobile phones.<br \/><br \/>Rhidian Taylor, Barclaycard&#8217;s head of brand management, added: &#8220;Our current logo and look have worked well for us as a UK credit card company, but they do not reflect the global payments company we have become. We needed to create a modern and distinctive look which signals where we are going as opposed to where we have been.&#8221;<\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/barclaycard_ball.gif\" alt=\"Barclaycard Icon\" \/><\/p>\n<p>It really is dispiriting to see such a derivative design from a design trend that is already poor to begin with. The &#8220;global&#8221; icon goes into a slightly different direction with its orange peel approach and could almost be interesting if it didn&#8217;t look just like all those other globes. And the typography is amazingly clunky and trying too hard to be friendly and approachable and, again, it&#8217;s just one more bad imitation of the bubblylowercase trend. Hopefully we&#8217;ve reached rock bottom with this combination of globes and overworked lowercases, it sure feels that way.
