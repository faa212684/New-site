Recently, the city introduced a revised and unified identity designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/esseninternational.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Essen International<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>Our rebranding for Stockholms stad was initiated by the need to coherently communicate a wide range of offerings, everything from world museums to scavenging. Stockholm is taking a giant leap forward, fueling its progress with the help of one strong vision, identity and statement.

While his portrait remains the same from the previous version, everything around him has changed. Gone is the antiquated serif previously surrounding him (literally) and in its place is a new, custom sans serif with the look and feel of contemporary design. A heavily geometric typeface that looks like a lot of others of its kind but with a couple of interesting hints of unique flavor like the lowercase &#8220;a&#8221;, &#8220;b&#8221;, &#8220;d&#8221;, etc. where the stem cuts directly through the circle. It&#8217;s not groundbreaking typography but it&#8217;s nice, clean, and modern, which is way more than could be said about the previous logo.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/stockholms_stad_logo_detail_posters.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for the City of Stockholm by Essen International\" \/>\n<figcaption>Posters.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/stockholms_stad_posters.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for the City of Stockholm by Essen International\" \/>\n<figcaption>Outdoor ads.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/stockholms_stad_typeface.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for the City of Stockholm by Essen International\" \/>\n<figcaption>Proprietary type family.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/stockholms_stad_icons.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for the City of Stockholm by Essen International\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icons.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/stockholms_stad_application_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for the City of Stockholm by Essen International\" \/>\n<figcaption>Extending the application into different city institutions like the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.stadsmuseet.stockholm.se\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Stockholm City Museum<\/a>&hellip;<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/stockholms_stad_application_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for the City of Stockholm by Essen International\" \/>\n<figcaption>&hellip; or the <a href=\"http:\/\/kulturfestivalen.stockholm.se\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Stockholm Kulturfestival<\/a>.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/stockholms_stad_online.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for the City of Stockholm by Essen International\" \/>\n<figcaption>Online presence.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/stockholms_stad_balloons.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for the City of Stockholm by Essen International\" \/>\n<figcaption>Adorable blond girl with balloons against magnificent sunset. If you hate this image there is something dead inside of you.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">Removing the blue and yellow color palette that dominated the previous logo has opened up the identity to embrace a number of other, more vibrant colors and the St. Erik portrait works equally well in its white version on blocks of color or in black against white backgrounds. The identity isn&#8217;t so much about visual fireworks but about establishing a clear and expansive communication system for a city that, well, communicates a lot in different instances. The single typeface approach for city branding may not be the most exciting but it can be efficient and when it comes to the successful management of cities, efficiency is king.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Stockholm, capital of Sweden, is a very well regarded city with a strong economy, extensive public transportation, environmental proclivity, vast culture, and a growing population.
