He won the French Open three times (1997, 2000, and 2001), and was the Tennis Masters Cup champion in 2000, becoming the only player to defeat Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi in the same major tournament. Kuerten suffered many problems with injuries which led him to miss a number of tournaments between 2002 and 2005. After a few failed attempts of comebacks, he retired from top-level tennis in May 2008. Kuerten is commonly known as Guga, an affectionate nickname which is a common abbreviation of the name Gustavo in Portuguese-speaking countries.&#8221; (<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gustavo_Kuerten\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wikipedia<\/a>)<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/guga_kuerten_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo for Guga Kuerten by LDC\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/guga_kuerten_proud.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Guga Kuerten by LDC\" \/>\n<figcaption>Guga Kuerten with Jose Augusto &#8220;Guga&#8221; Ketzer, president and partner of LDC.
