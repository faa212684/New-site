Evergy is their first foray into their own product selling it on a B2B level (so you can&#8217;t go to a store and get it yourself) and they are offering everything from traditional dumbbells to crossfit kettle bells and more. The new naming, logo, and identity have been created by Madrid-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.weimark.es\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Weimark Branding<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>The strategic work previously done by the team of Thomas Wellness Group, allowed us to directly address the creation phase of the brand name. The premises pointed to a naming for functional and cross training products, targeted activities and fitness room, which is marketed in a B2B environment will have on the quality and innovation its main promises of value. The exercise of verbal identity also explored a territory of expression with concepts such as motion, energy, Exceeding, Collective, Vitality or functionality. Finally the naming evergy leads us to a brand that is forever, evoking the continuous work done fitness enthusiasts. In addition implies movement, vitality, energy &#8230; an energy that is forever.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.weimark.es\/trabajos\/evergy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Weimark Branding project page (Google-translated)<\/a><\/h3>\n<p>The name Evergy is awkward. I totally get it that it&#8217;s a combination of &#8220;Ever&#8221; and &#8220;Energy&#8221; but it doesn&#8217;t feel like they belong truncated with each other. You could maybe argue that in Spanish the name sounds better. As a Spanish speaker I can attest that it doesn&#8217;t. Nonetheless, even if it doesn&#8217;t sound as poetic as Gatorade, or whatever, it does connote&#8230; well, energy, which is what this brand is about.<\/p>\n<blockquote>The next milestone of the project was to give a visual identity, a brand that empapase graphical attributes of name and enriqueciese graphically. We did an exercise figure background with infinite shape to create a symbol that would cater to the vitality of the brand superlative form and explosive. We also needed to have elements (for group classes) and breathed a formal equilibrium (by responding to disciplines such as yoga or pilates). Together we sought a dynamic, functional, quality and especially vital identity; so the look and feel is a stroke, ie, is the result of the expression of movement on all evergy products.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.weimark.es\/trabajos\/evergy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Weimark Branding project page (Google-translated)<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/evergy_logo_concept.png\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Evergy by Weimark Branding\" \/>\n<figcaption>Concept behind logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/evergy_logo.png\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Evergy by Weimark Branding\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>I wish I didn&#8217;t dislike &#8220;r&#8221;s like the one used in this project so much because it&#8217;s the one element in this logo that stops me from being more positively effusive about it, but we&#8217;ll get to that shortly. For being a new brand in the market this is a highly confident, minimal logo that&#8217;s fairly ambiguous as to what it may mean or stand for but that packs a kind of restrained energy in it, with the four individual arrows looking as if they are coming together or exploding outward. The implied X works nicely for those looking for an x-treme vibe but I also find that it strikes a rare balance between being a feminine and masculine icon and in the context of gym equipment this is a great attribute so that everyone feels confident (and not intimidated) to pump some iron.<\/p>\n<p>The wordmark is, in principle, pretty good and the &#8220;G&#8221;, more than the personally-grating &#8220;r&#8221;, is what stands out and works well in tandem with the &#8220;y&#8221;. I feel like the top curve of the &#8220;G&#8221; could have been extended just a tiny bit more so that it wouldn&#8217;t feel so chopped although it lines up well with its own crossbar. But, yeah, not to beat a dead horse, that &#8220;r&#8221; kills it for me in terms of how it abruptly breaks the rhythm of the wordmark by being so slender and lacking more real estate to throw a real curve off of its stem.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/evergy_products_alll.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Evergy by Weimark Branding\" \/>\n<figcaption>A few of the products.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/evergy_hero_weight_pink.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Evergy by Weimark Branding\" \/>\n<figcaption>Dumbbells.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/evergy_hero_kettlebell.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Evergy by Weimark Branding\" \/>\n<figcaption>Kettlebells.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/evergy_hero_benchpress.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Evergy by Weimark Branding\" \/>\n<figcaption>Barbell.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/evergy_hero_rope.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Evergy by Weimark Branding\" \/>\n<figcaption>Battle rope (I just learned the name of these after Googling them).<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/evergy_hero_medicine_ball.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Evergy by Weimark Branding\" \/>\n<figcaption>Medicine balls.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/evergy_hero_box.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Evergy by Weimark Branding\" \/>\n<figcaption>And a box for good measure.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">The true testament of how good the icon is is how well it can adapt to any of these crazy products and be rendered in all kinds of sizes, bevels, reliefs, materials, and colors. The barbell disks or plates or whatever that dude is bench-pressing are the absolute best example of the logo literally expanding to adapt to its surface and still clearly communicating the company it belongs to. Now, if someone could whip that &#8220;r&#8221; into shape, I would greatly appreciate it.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Launched earlier this year, Evergy is a new range of fitness products and equipment designed and produced by Spanish company Thomas Wellness Group, that specializes in outfitting gyms, fitness centers, hotels, and corporate offices with athletic equipment from other brands&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[12,26,87],"tags":[108,1125,395,979,1316,404],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4933"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4933"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4933\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4933"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4933"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4933"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
