Being a B2B product, the bottles could have gotten a mediocre design with the thinking that consumers didn&#8217;t have to choose it from the shelf but, instead, the design by local firm <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sweetsneak.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sweet Sneak<\/a>, is better than much of the stuff you can buy off the proverbial shelf. A lovely high-contrast sans serif logo accentuates the labels that come in a variety of unexpected color combinations and simple but effective information for each flavor. Bonus points for the Renaissance-still-life-painting-like photos for the case study. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sweetsneak.com\/portfolio-item\/the-syrup-company\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Four Spa by Nice People<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_fourspa.jpg\" alt=\"Four Spa by Nice People\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/four.com.sa\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Four Spa<\/a> is a luxury nail salon and spa with three locations in Saudi Arabia. The identity, designed by Los Angeles, CA-based <a href=\"https:\/\/nicepeopleco.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nice People<\/a>, features an elegant wordmark in a tightly-set Art Deco-ish sans serif that appears in gold or pink on a sea of light pink and white applications. It&#8217;s so soothing you don&#8217;t even have to go to the spa to relieve some stress. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/nicepeopleco.com\/Four-Spa\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Granger by Mildred &amp; Duck<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_granger.jpg\" alt=\"Granger by Mildred &amp; Duck\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/granger.cafe\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Granger<\/a> is a cafe and restaurant in Caulfield East, a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, that serves some <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/granger.cafe\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">delicious-looking food<\/a>. The identity, designed by Fitzroy, Victoria-based <a href=\"https:\/\/mildredandduck.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mildred &amp; Duck<\/a>, follows the cues of the interior design with a color palette of grays accentuated by a muted green and an overall contemporary but relaxing aesthetic. The extra round &#8220;G&#8221;s (and their itty bitty crossbar) in the wordmark contrast nicely with the rest of the condensed letters &#8212; when a logo looks that good on a receipt, you know you got something good going. All the applications have a great, airy feeling and the color palette works great. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mildredandduck.com\/granger\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Some elegant and nicely colored projects this week, with work from Copenhagen, Los Angeles, and Fitzroy&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[69,11,73,85,26],"tags":[294,53,369,564,1176],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7508"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=7508"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7508\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=7508"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=7508"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=7508"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
