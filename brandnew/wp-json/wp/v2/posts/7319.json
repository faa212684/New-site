(It used to look <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/Bh77lWZANkh\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">like this<\/a>.) The new packaging, designed by St. Petersburg, FL-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.breakmaiden.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Break Maiden<\/a> (no relationship to Iron), has a fun mix of elements in the clean sans serif logo on a curve &#8212; that, in some applications breaks from the curve and goes whacky &#8212; the lovely set of flavor illustrations, and the on-trend <a href=\"https:\/\/www.myfonts.com\/fonts\/urw\/windsor\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Windsor<\/a>, all in a lovely color palette tied in by the dark green color. Not only will you poop good but you will look good in preparation for doing so while drinking this. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.breakmaiden.co\/olipop\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Keel Surf &amp; Supply by Chaptr<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_keelsurf.jpg\" alt=\"Keel Surf &amp; Supply by Chaptr\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.keelsurfsupply.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Keel Surf &amp; Supply<\/a> is, as its name implies, a surf shop for boards and accessories, located in Freshwater, a suburb of Sydney, Australia. The identity, designed by Miami, Queensland-based <a href=\"https:\/\/wearechaptr.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Chaptr<\/a>, is pretty straightforward and unsurprisingly surf-shop-y but it&#8217;s somehow super pleasing. The combination of decorative serif with the slightly quirky sans serif works great and I like how the main lock-up used in most applications includes the address. All the little graphic doodads are a fun addition. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/wearechaptr.com\/keel\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">The Brass Onion by Carpenter Collective<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_brassonion.jpg\" alt=\"The Brass Onion by Carpenter Collective\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/thebrassonion.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Brass Onion<\/a> is a restaurant on Overland Park, KS, serving a contemporary and refined take on comfort food. The identity, designed by Kansas City, MO-based <a href=\"https:\/\/carpentercollective.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Carpenter Collective<\/a>, has a comforting feel all its own with some great illustrations that all charmingly revolve around onions while the typography in the logo provides a refined accent for the system. The brass\/gold and blue combo is surprisingly nice but what is not surprising is that I want that fried chicken. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/carpentercollective.com\/project\/the-brass-onion\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Some fun, lighthearted fare this week, with projects from St. Petersburg, Miami (Australia), and Kansas City&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[51,11,75,85,26],"tags":[294,1039,564,1666],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7319"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=7319"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7319\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=7319"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=7319"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=7319"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
