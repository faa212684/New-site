I love that it can be rotated 180 degrees and it reads the exact same way. It has the right angle, the right spacing, the right abstraction&#8230; just, very right.&#8221;<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video controls><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mural_arts_philadelphia_followup_variations_wide.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Some of the variations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Here is an interesting point of discussion: how come the variations for Mural Arts feel and look so good and appropriate but <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/new_logo_and_identity_for_pandora.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the variations for Pandora<\/a> did not feel nor look so good, even though it&#8217;s arguably the same concept and approach? The question is somewhat rhetorical as the variations for Mural Arts feel more genuine and relevant, further establishing a link between the variety of artists and styles that the organization collaborates with and, although you could say the same thing about Pandora, the link they are trying to establish is more abstract by attempting to give a visual representation to different music genres and it feels more like a veneer rather than an integral part of the project.

(By the way, those are some dense information business cards!). The combination of the logo broken apart, the blocks of typography, the fields of color, and the mural artwork in the backgrounds strike a strong balance of all those elements and yield very convincing brochures.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mural_arts_philadelphia_followup_program_mural_month_01.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Logo and Identity for Mural Arts Philadelphia by J2 Design\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mural_arts_philadelphia_followup_program_mural_month_02.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Logo and Identity for Mural Arts Philadelphia by J2 Design\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mural_arts_philadelphia_followup_mural_month_branding.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Logo and Identity for Mural Arts Philadelphia by J2 Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Mural Arts Month program and specific branding.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>For Mural Arts Month &#8212; and possibly for other events and initiatives &#8212; there is a nice introduction of a serif that in other cases would be far too many things but here, and not to keep adding praise for praise&#8217;s sake, it&#8217;s the right dose and right way of mixing the ingredients.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mural_arts_philadelphia_followup_event_fresh_look.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Logo and Identity for Mural Arts Philadelphia by J2 Design\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mural_arts_philadelphia_followup_event_fresh_look_02.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Logo and Identity for Mural Arts Philadelphia by J2 Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>This and all images below are from an event that took place last week, &#8220;Mural Arts &amp; J2 Design | A First Look at a Fresh Look&#8221;.
