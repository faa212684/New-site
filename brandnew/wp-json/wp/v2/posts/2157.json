Recently, BC Film + Media introduced its new name and identity designed by Vancouver-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.smashlab.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">smashLAB<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>The new BCFM mark utilizes two key blocks that both cluster information and play off one another to create a little visual tension. The grouping of these forms is echoed throughout all of the organization&#8217;s materials, creating a sense of energy and movement.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.smashlab.com\/results\/bcfm\/bcfm-brand\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">smashLAB Case Study<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bcfm_01.gif\" alt=\"British Columbia Film Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bcfm_02.jpg\" alt=\"British Columbia Film Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bcfm_03.jpg\" alt=\"British Columbia Film Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<blockquote>BCFM&#8217;s identity system is based on the notion of new forms. Similar to the way the organization helps facilitate the creation of new forms of content, they also help explore the future of media. This is brought to life here, through a number of moving, organic forms that mutate to take on new characteristics in varying settings. [&hellip;] Printed elements in the BCFM identity tend to utilize rich blotches of colour on light backgrounds, whereas their digital counterparts are generally more like light sources in dark settings. In all areas, a rich, broad spectrum of color helps convey the energy found in the industry and the work it creates.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.smashlab.com\/results\/bcfm\/bcfm-brand\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">smashLAB Case Study<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bcfm_04.jpg\" alt=\"British Columbia Film Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bcfm_05.jpg\" alt=\"British Columbia Film Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bcfm_06.jpg\" alt=\"British Columbia Film Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bcfm_07.jpg\" alt=\"British Columbia Film Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The previous logo was a bit of a bore and far from imaginative with its literal depiction of film through a film lens &mdash; we have certainly seen worse &#8220;before&#8221; logos so I won&#8217;t be too hard on this one. The new logo isn&#8217;t that much more imaginative by itself: it&#8217;s a simple monogram in a robotic-ish, monospaced font set in a crosshair that does manage to establish a contemporary and edgy flavor to the identity. The name of the organization is nicely locked-up on the diagonal, creating good tension. But, again, nothing too out of the ordinary to see here. The real joy of this identity kicks in with amorphous blotches of color that remind me of that cool (but sad) moment when old-school film burns and you just see these blobs of yellow light eat at the image. So, this is like that, but less destructive and with happier, cheerier colors. The simple logo now looks and works great against these backdrops, be it on dark or light. I do have to wonder how long this &#8220;heavy&#8221; look can last and if the organization might grow tired of it, but I would guess there is a way to eventually dial down the intensity and still keep the same effect. Now, if you&#8217;ll excuse me I&#8217;m going to stare the rest of the day at those blotches. They are deliciously hypnotic.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bcfm_08.jpg\" alt=\"British Columbia Film Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bcfm_09.jpg\" alt=\"British Columbia Film Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bcfm_10.jpg\" alt=\"British Columbia Film Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_121009_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_121009_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_121009_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_121009_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,79,26],"tags":[292,617,335,570],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2157"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2157"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2157\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2157"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2157"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2157"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
