A part of renewable energy firm, Fotowatio, POWEN also aims to become a source of information and education about solar energy as well as drive renewable energy forward in the country. The identity for the new company has been designed by <a href=\"https:\/\/saffron-consultants.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Saffron<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>From the idea of &#8216;give power to the people&#8217; we created POWEN. A name to convey the strength of the principles and mission of the company that simultaneously sounds strong in every market.<br \/><br \/>To create a visual identity based on the defined strategy, Saffron&#8217;s design studio brought the logotype to life. The identity was designed to mirror the smart control panels that the company provides to empower their customers&#8217; usage.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/saffron-consultants.com\/projects\/powen\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Saffron project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<p>One important thing to consider about the name is that it&#8217;s not pronounced like &#8220;Power&#8221; in English &#8212; even though that&#8217;s a very evident source for the name &#8212; but rather as &#8220;Paw-gwen&#8221; (more or less in phonetic English), which turns it into a relatively random\/made-up word (a la Xerox) for most Spanish-speaking people. I&#8217;m not a big naming connoisseur but in whichever way you pronounce it, there is something slightly odd about the name.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/powen_logo.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for POWEN by Saffron\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>To reflect the brand&#8217;s role as an engaged educator, communicating in real time we crafted a set of malleable graphic emotions to illustrate the ever-changing state of energy. These states are enhanced by a powerful colour palette inspired in the changing colours of light throughout the day.<br \/><br \/>This was accompanied by clear typography and a system of pictograms that adapt to the needs of the business to communicate complex information in a simple way.<br \/><br \/>The combination of these elements allows the brand a visual expression that represents its mission and brand purpose, creating an open interaction between the company and the user.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/saffron-consultants.com\/projects\/powen\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Saffron project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/powen_icons.png\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for POWEN by Saffron\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icons.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/powen_color_spectrum.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for POWEN by Saffron\" \/>\n<figcaption>Color spectrum.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Powen_Logo_Morphing.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<hr \/>\n<div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/powen_logo_variations.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo variations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The logo uses a simple, nondescript sans serif to deliver a range of abstract icons in place of the &#8220;O&#8221;. It&#8217;s a bold move given that it&#8217;s a new name being introduced to the market but since most of the icons are round\/square it&#8217;s not that difficult to decipher them as &#8220;O&#8221;s. Even though each icon means something I doubt anyone will be able to decipher <em>that<\/em>. Still, they activate the logo in an interesting and memorable way that makes it demand some extra attention. The shapes are interesting and, colored in gradients, they stand out nicely from the all-black typography. As far as how the logo might be interpreted by someone interacting with this brand for the first time and without the backstory of the icons and colors, I think there is something visually positive about the colorful shapes inside the more corporate-like typography&#8230; almost like a flower growing in a harsh environment, which is a nice metaphor for renewable energy&#8230; a bright spot in an otherwise gloomy climate outlook. But if that&#8217;s too metaphorical, the shapes with gradients look happy.<\/p>\n<blockquote>Using the &#8220;o&#8221; of Powen as the container we adapted its shapes to contain different messages, moods and symbols. No longer housed as a signature in a corner, it becomes central to the message across all communications. It provides a reminder of the ubiquitous presence of energy in the lives of customers, powering everything they do, reminding them of its power.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/saffron-consultants.com\/projects\/powen\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Saffron project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/powen_logo_pattern.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for POWEN by Saffron\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logos with messaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video controls controlsList=\"nodownload\" poster=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/powen_logo_icon_size.jpg\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/powen_logo_icon_size.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Icon size variations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video controls controlsList=\"nodownload\" poster=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/powen_logo_various_shapes.jpg\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/powen_logo_various_shapes.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Multiple icons in logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The icons in the logo can increase in size or quantity as well as include messaging within them.

The posters are a little extreme in their gradient waterfalls so maybe stick with the layouts that have stronger use of white space and tension. Overall, this feels like a 1960s flower power aesthetic crossed with a utility provider corporate aesthetic, which is a funky but interesting intersection.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 2017, POWEN is a new solar energy service in Spain, focusing on solar panel installations for people&apos;s homes and small-to-medium-sized companies&apos; places of business.
