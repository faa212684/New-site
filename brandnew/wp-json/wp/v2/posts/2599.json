As long as they keep producing crap like this, no updated logo will ever make a difference.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo &mdash; traced from an illustration found on a dictionary, according to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/money\/business\/2013\/07\/17\/hooters-hootie-owl-breastaurant\/2529073\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this USA Today story<\/a> &mdash; has always helped give Hooters that cheap, cheesy, smarmy vibe that one would associate with a highly successful chain of restaurants whose main attraction is women&#8217;s cleavage. In terms of juvenile humor of using an owl (or hooter) and its big eyes as the &#8220;O&#8221;s in the name that also look like a pair of breasts is relatively ingenious. That, plus the giggle from anyone who sees the logo for the first time, is what has made this logo so iconic. The new logo keeps the boob equity of the original with a less, creepy taxidermic look by going with a more cartoonish approach. It&#8217;s no more better than it&#8217;s worse. It still exudes the same cheap, cheesy, smarmy vibe but with more bezier points than before. The typography appears to be slightly improved, but that&#8217;s not saying much. Overall, it&#8217;s a redesign that makes sense but one that doesn&#8217;t lift the brand beyond what it already is.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1983 when it opened its first location in Clearwater, FL, Hooters is the original and still one of the leading &quot;breastaurants&quot; with 412 restaurants in 44 states of the U.S. and 27 countries around the world.
