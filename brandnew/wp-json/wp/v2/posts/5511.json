Now, as a regular scheduled airline, Nordwind has a fleet of 20 planes flying to 33 destinations within Russia and 10 in different cities in Europe. In March, Nordwind introduced a new identity and livery designed by Lisbon, Portugal-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.uma-studio.com\/work\/nordwind-airlines\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">UMA<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nordwind_airlines_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Livery for Nordwind Airlines by UMA\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nordwind_airlines_guidelines.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Livery for Nordwind Airlines by UMA\" \/>\n<figcaption>Guidelines.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo, were it not for it being in the shape of an airplane&#8217;s tail, could have easily been for a chartered bus company not for a company that puts giant metal tubes in the air. The star, the default-looking type, the brick and yellow colors&#8230; none of it was very exciting or confidence-inducing. The new logo looks confidently and strikingly like an airline logo. The &#8220;N&#8221; monogram is great with a bold combination of round corners and sharp angles and the extra wide structure is very airline-ish, as is the italic bent. It reminds me a lot, in spirit, of <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/File:Northwest_Airlines_1989-2003.svg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the old Northwest Airlines logo<\/a>, although there is no &#8220;W&#8221; hidden in this one. The wordmark is nice and not a geometric sans serif so that&#8217;s awesome to start with. The lock-ups, though, are somehow not fully pleasing; neither the stacked or horizontal versions work seamlessly. I mean, they are good, but given how good the monogram is, I wish the lock-ups were locked-down.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nordwind_airlines_flag.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Livery for Nordwind Airlines by UMA\" \/>\n<figcaption>Flag.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nordwind_airlines_signage.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Livery for Nordwind Airlines by UMA\" \/>\n<figcaption>Signage.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Seeing the signage&#8230; maybe there is something pleasing about this other lock-up where each element gets smaller, almost like a Russian nested doll.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nordwind_airlines_livery_before_after_a.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Livery for Nordwind Airlines by UMA\" \/>\n<figcaption>Livery, before and after.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old livery matched the logo: very ho-hum, not a press-your-nose-against-the-glass-to-see-it-on-the-runway kind of design. The new livery gets closer to that feeling:<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nordwind_airlines_livery_plans.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Livery for Nordwind Airlines by UMA\" \/>\n<figcaption>Livery blueprint.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nordwind_airlines_livery_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Livery for Nordwind Airlines by UMA\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nordwind_airlines_livery_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Livery for Nordwind Airlines by UMA\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nordwind_airlines_livery_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Livery for Nordwind Airlines by UMA\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nordwind_airlines_livery_04.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Livery for Nordwind Airlines by UMA\" \/>\n<figcaption>Livery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">Other than yet another oddly resolved lock-up near the door of the airplane, this is a wonderful livery. The monogram looks great on the tail but even better as a white knockout on the light gray fuselage that gives that area of the plane a big, bold graphic treatment. I also like that they didn&#8217;t flip the logo on the side of the tail where the angle is opposite. The best detail, though, are the dark gray turbines&#8230; they really make the airplane. Overall, this is a fantastic change that makes Nordwind look like a legitimate, world-class airline.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 2008 and headquartered in Moscow, Russia, Nordwind Airlines began as a charter airline with only three planes flying to six destinations.
