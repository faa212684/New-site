The identity, designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/garbett.com.au\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Garbett Design<\/a>, takes the minimalist approach you would expect for an architecture bookstore but manages to imbue it with plenty of personality through the oddball wordmark in a monospace font &#8212; Klim Type Foundry&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.futurefonts.xyz\/klim\/the-future-mono\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Future Mono<\/a> &#8212; that is half futuristic, half Art Deco, and has handy &#8220;h&#8221;s that look like chairs that have been neatly lined up. The oversize apostrophe is particularly fun too. Additionally, a chevron\/arrow device serves as a recurring icon and can become its own bookmark. The subtle red and blue color palette is unexpected and a pleasant surprise. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/garbett.com.au\/design\/the-architects-bookshop#gallery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Drav by Wedge<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_drav.jpg\" alt=\"Drav by Wedge\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/drav.ca\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Drav<\/a> is a brewery that launched last year in Clermont, Qu\u00e9bec, to produce beers for &#8220;those whose left hand gets cold, but never get cold feet&#8221;, whatever that may mean. The packaging, designed by Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wedge.work\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wedge<\/a>, has a hipster aesthetic that, to be honest, I&#8217;m not sure I like yet I can&#8217;t look away. The cans combine the name in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.myfonts.com\/fonts\/urw\/windsor\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Windsor<\/a>, naturally; some odd holding shape; and a deadpan sans serif, all in a retro color palette and photographed as if they were models being photographed by Terry Richardson with the bright flashes. I don&#8217;t want to like it, but I do. I&#8217;m weak. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wedge.work\/project\/drav-fr\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Objet Particulier by atipo<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_object_particulier.jpg\" alt=\"Objet Particulier by atipo\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/objetparticulier.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Objet Particulier<\/a> is a studio in Gij\u00f3n, Spain, that produces furniture and interior design elements using galuchet, a special kind of leather made of manta ray skin. The identity, designed by local firm <a href=\"https:\/\/atipo.es\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">atipo<\/a>, features a lovely icon of a manta ray that forms an abstract &#8220;op&#8221; monogram. As I write this, I shed a tear for the manta rays, but I digress. Paired with a slightly quirky sans serif and in another blue and red color palette, the icon works as its own particular object, looking elegant and a little eccentric in the applications. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/atipo.es\/projects\/objet-particulier\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"A range of minimalist projects this week, with work from Sydney, Montr\u00e9al, and Gij\u00f3n&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[51,11,86,26],"tags":[1672,184,1673],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7389"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=7389"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7389\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=7389"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=7389"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=7389"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
