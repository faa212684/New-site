Thank you for your patience this week with the limited amount of posting. The workload for the Brand New Conference is at its peak, so time is short. I&#8217;ll try to post a few things next week as well.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">John &amp; Jane by Skinn<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_johnandjane.gif\" alt=\"John &amp; Jane by Skinn\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.johnandjane.be\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">John &amp; Jane<\/a> is a company in Ruiselede, Belgium, providing event technical support, including light, video, sound, and decor for corporate events, performances, weddings, and more. Although named after only two people, the company has a staff of over 40 and it&#8217;s all about collaboration as exemplified by their playful identity and copywriting by Brugge, Belgium-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.skinn.be\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Skinn<\/a>. The highlight is an ampersand monogram created by the intersection of two &#8220;J&#8221;s. How genius this is, is the stuff Friday Like envy is made of. Without the animation it would not be so evident but it&#8217;s a great secret to reveal. I tend to knock on geometric sans fonts but this is one case where it&#8217;s the perfect choice and delivery mechanism for the name to highlight the ampersand. The complementary monospace font is nice and trendy &#8212; along with <em>that<\/em> blue (holla Vealchop!). Another element that makes this identity great are the comparisons to other popular ampersand-ed couples that are not just cute for cute&#8217;s sake but actually cover the capabilities and value of hiring them &#8212; my favorite being &#8220;Peaceful like Yin &amp; Yang&#8221; because when technical issues happen you want the team to keep it together. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.skinn.be\/werk\/detail\/john-and-jane\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Rico Rico Paelleria by And A Half<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_ricorico.jpg\" alt=\"Rico Rico Paelleria by And A Half\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pg\/ricoricoph\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rico Rico<\/a> is fast-casual restaurant in Taguig, Philippines, flinging paella and a few other Spanish treats. Designed by Pasig, Philippines-based <a href=\"http:\/\/and-a-half.ph\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">And a Half<\/a>, the identity is a funky mix of typography, patterns, and illustrations that while not necessarily fully fused as good paella, they do convey a colorful, cheerful vibrancy. The highlight, to me, is the wordmark that rather than just repeating &#8220;RICO&#8221; the same way twice, makes the effort and shifts the widths of the &#8220;CO&#8221; in each for a design with more rhythm and interest. The illustrations have nothing to do stylistically with anything else but I do enjoy a bullfighting pig and mustachioed squid and shrimp as much as the next person. There are bonus faux cans of produce that make for great decor that look like vintage grocery store items. With a little more time to simmer, this could all take on a lot more flavor. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/and-a-half.ph\/projects\/ricorico\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">101 by 101<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_101company.jpg\" alt=\"101 by 101\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/101.at\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">101<\/a> is a graphic design and coding company in Vienna, Austria. They recently redesigned their own identity with a relatively trendy and safe sans serif and Brutalist-light aesthetic, which is not all that interesting, to be honest. But the &#8220;101&#8221; logo, especially as used foil stamped on a sweet range of color stock, is extra super nice. The smaller, quieter typography in the business cards is quite good too and would have been more than enough to complement the logo without all the angled Arial-esque typography. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/101.at\/project\/101\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Some playful, colorful, and blue-accented project today, with work from Brugge, Pasig, and Vienna&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[36,11,85,26],"tags":[662,292,39,564],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5794"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=5794"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5794\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=5794"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=5794"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=5794"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
