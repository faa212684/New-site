Not to mention that the available images look like roadkill. As many of you may have caught, Chrysler announced a bunch of things this past week in relation to their emerging from the bottom of the auto industry barrel &mdash; our blogging colleagues at idsgn <a href=\"http:\/\/www.idsgn.org\/posts\/new-wings-for-chrysler\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">have put together something more comprehensive<\/a> than I was willing to on this Friday morning. On their web site, Chrysler has made available <a href=\"http:\/\/www.chryslergroupllc.com\/business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a lot of PDFs covering their Plan<\/a>, among them is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.chryslergroupllc.com\/pdf\/business\/chrysler_brand.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a PDF on the brand going forward<\/a>, showing a new logo. First, my god, what an abominate design on those PDFs, really embarrassing. Second, the new logo might just as well say &#8220;CHOCOLATE&#8221; in there because the ratio of wings to type is ridiculously high. And I really don&#8217;t foresee these wings, which look average at best, building enough graphic equity to come to signify Chrysler, especially in an industry where the big players have some of the most instantly recognizable logos. Good luck fellas!<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.squarelogo.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">David Holm<\/a> for first tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/964"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=964"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/964\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=964"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=964"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=964"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
