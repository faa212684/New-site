Starting with the logo, every thin line of each character is perfectly in place and in rhythm creating a subtle optical illusion of movement. At smaller sizes and on straight-up black (see business cards lower in the post) it starts to get messy and jarring so to keep things elegant, I guess, just avoid small sizes and black. The contracting approach for negative words and expanding for positive words might get lost on the casual viewer but it&#8217;s also the kind of visual message that passes unperceived at first glance yet still triggers something in the subconscious. I&#8217;m not trying to get too metaphysical here! Just really enjoying the idea.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mlinda_words_bad.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Mlinda by johnson banks\" \/>\n<figcaption>Words + Images = Negative.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mlinda_words_good.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Mlinda by johnson banks\" \/>\n<figcaption>Words + Images = Positive.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mlinda_icons.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Mlinda by johnson banks\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icons.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mlinda_business_cards.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Mlinda by johnson banks\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mlinda_bellyband.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Mlinda by johnson banks\" \/>\n<figcaption>Belly-band for a plan to give out second-hand books of relevance.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">In application there is not a lot to see yet. It&#8217;s mostly the different positive and negative words on images meant to stir consciences &mdash; I&#8217;m not convinced that full color photos are the best backdrop for the words as it starts to look too much like an ad campaign. Perhaps some moody duotones and adding a color to the words might add some drama. Regardless, this is a smart concept that elegantly illustrates the mission of the foundation.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Loosely established in Paris in 2005, while its founders juggled other full-time activities, the Mlinda focuses on &quot;the impact that economic growth has on the environment&quot; working on &quot;shifting mindsets from short-term attitudes to long-term values&quot; and targeting &quot;individual behaviour&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[67,12,26],"tags":[296,1064,873,42],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3356"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3356"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3356\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3356"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3356"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3356"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
