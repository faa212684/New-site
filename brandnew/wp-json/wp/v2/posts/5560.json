Sometimes, they change the world.<br \/><br \/>The Earth&#8217;s axis, for example, is tilted at an angle of 23.5 degrees. Which brings different parts of the planet closer to the sun at different times. That&#8217;s why, as the year goes on, you can bask in summer sun, sink your boots into fresh winter snow, savour the flowering of spring, and glory in the blaze of autumn. All because of one detail.<br \/><br \/>That critical angle also reminds us how interconnected we all are. Even when sometimes we feel more separate than ever.<br \/><br \/>The shifting seasons remind us that we&#8217;re all fellow citizens of Earth, affected by the same elemental forces.<br \/><br \/>That&#8217;s why we&#8217;ve chosen the 23.5-degree tilt of the Earth&#8217;s axis as the key to the World Design Weeks identity.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/wearemucho.com\/project\/world-design-weeks\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mucho project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video controls><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/world_design_weeks_intro.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Introduction.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/world_design_weeks_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for World Design Weeks by Mucho\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/world_design_weeks_logo_colors.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for World Design Weeks by Mucho\" \/>\n<figcaption>Color options.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/world_design_weeks_lockups_a.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for World Design Weeks by Mucho\" \/>\n<figcaption>Lock-up with other Design Weeks.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/world_design_weeks_logo_summit.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for World Design Weeks by Mucho\" \/>\n<figcaption>Summit 2017 logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The concept for the logo might be a little self-aggrandizing in terms of equating the tilt of the Earth with that of the logo for an organization for Design Weeks &#8212; we can survive without the latter but certainly not without the former. Nevertheless, it&#8217;s an appropriate concept and one that&#8217;s been executed perfectly. The tilt is literally visualized as a slash at the angle of the Earth and has just the right length to become more than just an accent slash. The wordmark, in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.myfonts.com\/fonts\/fontfont\/mark\/?refby=ucllc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FF Mark<\/a>, stacks along the angle in a straightforward but pleasing way, in part because the &#8220;W&#8221;s have been altered to be more parallel to the axis. The length of the slash, when paired with the word mark, also looks like a flag, which continues the global-ish theme. The slash also makes for a great segue or glue with member logos or to define hierarchy as in the Summit logo. As simple and basic as it is, it&#8217;s all about the execution. Haters of reflex blue gonna hate and, to a degree, I might side with you this time as this probably deserved something less default or design-y.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/world_design_weeks_colors_a.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for World Design Weeks by Mucho\" \/>\n<figcaption>Color palette.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/world_design_weeks_typography_a.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for World Design Weeks by Mucho\" \/>\n<figcaption>Typography.
