With offices in five cities, M Capital has \u20ac500 million of assets under management, a portfolio of over 160 SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises), and since 2015, has been growing its venture portfolio  with Seed Series A and B funding. Later this Summer, M Capital is introducing a new identity designed by Paris, France-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.brandbrothers.fr\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brand Brothers<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>From the outset, we wanted to avoid conforming to the classic aesthetics of financial companies, while developing a solid and serious visual base. Our focus is on the mantra &#8220;Amplifying the extraordinary&#8221;, an emphatic and deliberately oversized promise, we have built a typographic identity imbued with clarity and radicality. The logo, a stable and structured typographical design, reveals some oddities that bring the right dose of singularity. A palette of bright colours makes it possible to offer strong contrasts on the different variations.<br \/><br \/>The visual imprint is then built around the monogram &#8220;M-&#8220;, which, through a play of scales, illustrates the promise of growth and progress. A construction game that allows you to create infinite graphic patterns and unify the various materials.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.brandbrothers.fr\/en\/m-capital-visual-identity-branding-editorial-design\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brand Brothers project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/m_capital_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for M Capital by Brand Brothers\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/m_capital_logo_construction.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for M Capital by Brand Brothers\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo construction.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/m_capital_logo_subbrands.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for M Capital by Brand Brothers\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sub-brands.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo was bland and lacking any kind of personality but was mostly inoffensive (other than perhaps the random sizing and alignment of &#8220;PARTNERS&#8221;). The new logo definitely demands attention with a strong repeating upward angle among most of its characters that yield a very unique typographic result. It operates within the Brutalist aesthetic but there is some refinement to it that makes it move beyond the trend. I love the construction of the &#8220;A&#8221;s &#8212; they are kind of rebellious but still within the corporate realm. The &#8220;P&#8221; and the &#8220;L&#8221;, under other circumstances, I probably wouldn&#8217;t like but their angles support the premise of the logo. The one difficult character is the &#8220;C&#8221; but I think they integrated it as good as possible. I know I&#8217;ve been saying this a lot lately but anything that&#8217;s NOT a generic sans serif wordmark feels like a major win and this one excels at avoiding the safety of generic sans serifs.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/m_capital_monogram_composition_animation.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/m_capital_monogram_composition.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for M Capital by Brand Brothers\" \/>\n<figcaption>&#8220;M-&#8221; monogram.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The &#8220;M-&#8221; device could have easily just been the monogram, once, and I&#8217;m sure it will possibly be used as such on social media, but its repetition at different sizes and angled compositions creates a wonderfully dynamic visual for both motion and static applications.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/m_capital_guidelines.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for M Capital by Brand Brothers\" \/>\n<figcaption>Guidelines.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/m_capital_business_cards.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for M Capital by Brand Brothers\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/m_capital_letterhead.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for M Capital by Brand Brothers\" \/>\n<figcaption>Letterhead.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/m_capital_annual_report.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for M Capital by Brand Brothers\" \/>\n<figcaption>Annual report.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The institutional materials are bold and and confident, using the wordmark, monogram, and pattern as large as the layouts will hold.

It&#8217;s very straightforward but effective. The color palette seems somewhat aleatory and disconnected&#8230; I&#8217;m thinking of that light pink and tan, not sure why they are in there.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/m_capital_funner_things_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for M Capital by Brand Brothers\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/m_capital_funner_things_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for M Capital by Brand Brothers\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/m_capital_funner_things_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for M Capital by Brand Brothers\" \/>\n<figcaption>Another style of layouts, with photography.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Another approach builds in photography into the layout and all of a sudden the supporting typography is doing odd things too so things start to get a little hectic. If the photography were way less busy and the typography trying less hard this would be a nice bonus of application as I really like how they integrate a single &#8220;M-&#8221; in the corner but it gets lost amidst the chaos.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/m_capital_tshirt.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for M Capital by Brand Brothers\" \/>\n<figcaption>T-shirt.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/m_capital_tote.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for M Capital by Brand Brothers\" \/>\n<figcaption>Totes.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">Overall, I feel like this identity has some swagger to it but without the arrogance associated with that word.
