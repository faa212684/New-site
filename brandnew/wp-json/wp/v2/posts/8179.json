The official language is Dutch, but a secondary official language in the province of Friesland is West Frisian. In the northern parts of the country, Low Saxon is also spoken. The five largest cities in the Netherlands are Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, Utrecht, and Eindhoven. Amsterdam is the country&#8217;s capital, while The Hague holds the seat of the States General, Cabinet and Supreme Court. The Port of Rotterdam is the largest port in Europe, and the largest in any country outside Asia. The country is a founding member of the EU, Eurozone, G10, NATO, OECD and WTO, as well as a part of the Schengen Area and the trilateral Benelux Union. It hosts several intergovernmental organisations and international courts, many of which are centered in The Hague, which is consequently dubbed &#8216;the world&#8217;s legal capital&#8217;. Its mixed-market advanced economy had the thirteenth-highest per capita income globally. The Netherlands ranks among the highest in international indexes of press freedom,[19] economic freedom,[20] human development, and quality of life, as well as happiness.&#8221; (<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Netherlands\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wikipedia<\/a>)<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/netherlands_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo for Netherlands by Studio Dumbar\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"&quot;The Netherlands, informally Holland, is a country in Northwestern Europe with some overseas territories in the Caribbean.
