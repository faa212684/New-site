Given that it&#8217;s a new program, not much more information is available. The school&#8217;s new name, identity, and online presence have been created by London-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.studiokoto.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Koto<\/a> (also launched this year).<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/debroc_business_school_name.png\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for DeBroc Business School by Koto\" \/>\n<figcaption>On the new school name.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The resulting identity was born from the knowledge that direction is required for success in life, therefore our logo uses an inherent feeling of movement and connection &mdash; a lasting impact that reflects the experience had by the students.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.studiokoto.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Koto project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/debroc_business_school_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for DeBroc Business School by Koto\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/debroc_business_school_logo_detail_circle.png\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for DeBroc Business School by Koto\" \/>\n<figcaption>Circle version.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/debroc_business_school_logo_grid.png\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for DeBroc Business School by Koto\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/debroc_business_school_logo_lockup.png\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for DeBroc Business School by Koto\" \/>\n<figcaption>Grid and lock-up.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Starting with a nice name &mdash; it sounds important and meaningful, like a rich man&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.devry.edu\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DeVry<\/a> &mdash; the monogram looks like it could be a combination of a &#8220;D&#8221; and &#8220;B&#8221; (or is simply just a &#8220;B&#8221; with a few lines in it for fun) and feels like a wax seal a Master of Coin would put on a bank statement to certify it. It&#8217;s simple and straightforward and although it may not be the most creative monogram in the world, it works quite nicely here for a business school. The wordmark has that sexy ugly sans serif aesthetic that&#8217;s all the rage in Europe &mdash; it&#8217;s hard to describe but the straight-up wordmark here is Exhibit A. (That poor &#8220;r&#8221; is so sad). The type-in-a-circle version is much nicer, particularly because of the numerals that are really pretty.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/debroc_business_school_photography_logo.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for DeBroc Business School by Koto\" \/>\n<figcaption>Photography integration.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/debroc_business_school_prospectus.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for DeBroc Business School by Koto\" \/>\n<figcaption>Prospectus.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">In application, the hook is that fields of color emanate from the diagonals in the monogram, supporting the concept quoted above of direction and connection. It&#8217;s another simple visual device and, with its the business-y color palette, looks both youthful and serious. The website is quite nice too and worth poking around to get a sense of the identity. Overall, a convincing and solid launch that makes it look like this business school has been around longer than never.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Launched this year, De Broc is the new business school at The University of Law &mdash; a private university in the UK, established in 1962 &mdash; and offers bachelors degrees in Business Management, Business &amp; Marketing, and Business &amp; Finance&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[29,12,26],"tags":[292,1172,40,42,1079,228],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4087"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4087"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4087\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4087"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4087"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4087"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
