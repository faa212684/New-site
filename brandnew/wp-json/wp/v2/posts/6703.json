Typeset in the otherwise not-exactly-elegant-looking <a href=\"https:\/\/www.myfonts.com\/fonts\/alias\/cactus\/?refby=ucllc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cactus<\/a> font, the logo is both elegant and contemporary yet classic. The &#8220;1848&#8221; numerals look like they were customized and it&#8217;s a detail that creates a lot of the personality in this project. The logo is then enlarged, cropped, and wrapped around a beautiful set of stark-white packaging with flashes of a muted orange color. The combination of materials, management of color, and playfulness of scale make for a vibrant and luxurious identity that also feels youthful and energetic, ready for the eighth generation. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/basedesign.com\/haute-joaillerie-with-a-downtown-attitude\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Noelle by Peck &amp; Company<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_noelle.jpg\" alt=\"Noelle by Peck &amp; Company\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/noelle-nashville.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Noelle<\/a> is a new boutique hotel in downtown Nashville, TN, occupying a building from the 1930s that has been beautifully restored to house 224 rooms, a restaurant, a coffee shop, a rooftop bar, and even a portrait and print studio. The identity, designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/peckandco.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Peck &amp; Company<\/a> adds to the nostalgic luxuriousness of the space with a stunning set of elements that include beautiful line-drawings of herons, custom numerals for the rooms, elegant typographic treatments, and sophisticated print production. The six pictures above barely begin to make the project justice. Definitely check out the full project link or, better yet, stay a night or two at Noelle if you can. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/peckandco.com\/noelle\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Bell by Matchstic<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_bellcabinets.jpg\" alt=\"Bell by Matchstic\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bellcabinetry.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bell<\/a> is a cabinetry and design company based in Georgia, making and installing cabinets for those who have outgrown (and out-salaried) the IKEA options.

The cabinetry-like layouts in the applications are a nice tie-in to the product. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/matchstic.com\/work\/bell\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"A stylish, elegant, and luxurious set of projects this week, with work from Brussels, Nashville, and Atlanta&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,73,86,26],"tags":[767,30,633,965,1592,1419],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6703"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=6703"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6703\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=6703"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=6703"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=6703"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
