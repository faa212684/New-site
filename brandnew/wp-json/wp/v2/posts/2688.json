Appropriately, the look is a mix of Victorian typography and ornamentation with a requisite hipster vibe, resulting in a positively Brooklynesque identity. My favorite part of this project is what seems to be the full range of explorations shown on the left image above. That would make for a great wallpaper. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/Daily-Press-Identity\/9935753\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Gentlemen&#8217;s Beans by Inject Design<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_gentlemensbeans.jpg\" alt=\"Gentlemen's Beans by Inject Design\"\/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">Located in Wellington, New Zealand, Gentlemen&#8217;s Beans is a boutique coffee shop featuring micro roasting and burly identity designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.inject.co.nz\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Inject Design<\/a>. The identity consists of three main elements: (1) a woodcut of a man resting on some coffee bean sacks, which is my least favorite part; (2) some very nice, hand-drawn typography sitting on a curve, where the length of &#8220;GENTLEMEN&#8217;S&#8221; really helps it lay nicely and its wobbliness looks great blown up as a sign; and (3) my favorite, the use of the color copper, it just looks hot. Like the beverage inside it is meant to be. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/Gentlemens-Beans\/10250205\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Koultoura Coffee by FullFill<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_koultura.jpg\" alt=\"Koultoura Coffee by FullFill\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">For <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Koultoura-Coffee\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Koultura Coffee<\/a>, a new independent coffee shop in West Jakarta, local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fullfillisme.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FullFill<\/a> created modest identity in terms of logo and typography but what got my attention was the introduction of four characters &mdash; a fox, a bear, a cat, and a rabbit &mdash; that take on a number of different aesthetic styles, from minimalist vectors to painterly portraits, to tie everything together inside the shop, help tell its story, and get local customers informed about coffee. Not a typical solution and not necessarily the most graphic of Friday Likes but definitely an interesting approach. <a href=\"http:\/\/identitydesigned.com\/koultoura-coffee\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"A triple macchiato of coffee-house identities with work from New York, New Zealand, and Jakarta&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[597],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2688"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2688"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2688\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2688"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2688"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2688"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
