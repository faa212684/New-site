It has a lowbrow vibe but with a strong grid holding it all together. The logo is cool and by being solid, bold shapes it stands out from all the stuff around it and helps anchor all the wackiness. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/40825433\/Boru\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Torafuku by Brief<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_torafuku.jpg\" alt=\"Torafuku by Brief\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.torafuku.ca\/\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Torafuku<\/a> is a pan Asian restaurant in Vancouver with a contemporary farm-to-table approach. The identity by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.brief-studio.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brief<\/a> reflects the contrast of traditional and contemporary with a range of classic patterns designed in thick lines and and presented in a vibrant palette of primary colors with a pastel hue. The patterns get emblazoned with a gold foil logo and are used as liners throughout the materials. My favorite aspect of this project, however, is the use of the colors in various elements of the restaurant, from the trays to the rubber bands in the menus to decorations like the water bottles and picture frames shown above. It&#8217;s a great way to extend an identity through physical objects. Another bonus is the restaurant&#8217;s website, which is remarkably simple, nice, and integrates all the elements perfectly. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.brief-studio.com\/filter\/all\/Torafuku\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Kimski by Franklyn<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_kimski.jpg\" alt=\"Kimski by Franklyn\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/kimskichicago.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kimski<\/a> is a fusion restaurant in Chicago, IL, serving Polish and Korean street food and the result looks a little something like <a href=\"http:\/\/static1.squarespace.com\/static\/576c29d3ff7c50b7fcb68bdf\/576c30e2d1758ee67ecb69d2\/576c4466579fb30cbde9cea0\/1466805433840\/Screen+Shot+2016-06-23+at+3.15.41+PM.png?format=2500w\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this<\/a>.

The logo is set in a monospace typeface to offset everything else and it makes sense in not making much sense but when it all looks this much fun, what&#8217;s sense got to do it? <a href=\"http:\/\/quitefranklyn.com\/project\/kimski\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Without a premeditated desire to choose only Asian restaurants, we have three Asian restaurant identities this week with work from Chihuahua, Vancouver, and Brooklyn&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[784,564],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4869"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4869"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4869\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4869"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4869"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4869"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
