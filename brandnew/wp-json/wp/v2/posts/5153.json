Like Warby Parker in the U.S., they aim to keep its prices accessible and its frames hiply designed, making it a point to own more than one pair of glasses to mix and match with your OOTD and mood. This month, Kaibosh is introducing a new identity &#8212; while retaining its existing logo &#8212; designed by Stockholm, Sweden-based <a href=\"http:\/\/snask.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Snask<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>We got contacted by the Norwegian eyewear company Kaibosh. They felt that they had become too boring as opposed to what they should be, a trendy and bold eyewear brand. They felt their identity was too clean and they wanted to be more expressive and outgoing. The fashionable contender would finally get a fitting dress as well as a lovely new voice. We got the assignment to start out with keeping their existing logotype and from that develop their new brand ranging from signs, ads, packaging, bags, posters as well as create their entire flagship store.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/46841523\/Kaibosh\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Snask project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kaibosh_01_identity_elements.jpg\" alt=\"New Identity for Kaibosh by Snask\" \/>\n<figcaption>Identity elements.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>We started out writing their brand platform and tonality where they would use much more copywriting in their communication, from promotion material to walls in their stores. The brand and tonality was translated into visual form and matched with a custom-made display typeface, named Sentrum, made to suit the in-store signage. We added two eyelashes as a symbol to distinguish the identity as well as use as graphic elements for many different scenarios. We created the entire flagship store with shelving systems, signage, colors, murals, etc. The project ranged from typeface and still life photos to campaigns, fashion-photography, notebooks and towels.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/46841523\/Kaibosh\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Snask project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kaibosh_04_coffee_cup.jpg\" alt=\"New Identity for Kaibosh by Snask\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kaibosh_05_sweater.jpg\" alt=\"New Identity for Kaibosh by Snask\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kaibosh_11_towel.jpg\" alt=\"New Identity for Kaibosh by Snask\" \/>\n<figcaption>Promo items.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>While the logo remains &#8212; it&#8217;s the pointy wordmark at the bottom of the towel in the image directly above &#8212; it has been demoted quite a few ranks in favor of the more graphic device of the pair of eyelashes, which is bound to become more recognizable than the wordmark. Eye pupils tend to look creepy in logos or when minimized and they usually go better with optometrists so the choice to show two closed eyes, while counterintuitive to a company that sells glasses to use specifically when your eyes are in the open position, shifts the emphasis from clinical to fashionable by focusing on the eyelashes. The extra thick lines help the eyelashes feel genderless and make it a cool icon for both men and women. Plus, it&#8217;s amazing how many things you can put eyelashes on, like googly eyes.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kaibosh_06_tote-bag.jpg\" alt=\"New Identity for Kaibosh by Snask\" \/>\n<figcaption>Tote bag.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kaibosh_07_pile-of-letters.jpg\" alt=\"New Identity for Kaibosh by Snask\" \/>\n<figcaption>Pile of letters.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kaibosh_08_windowblinds-typography_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Identity for Kaibosh by Snask\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kaibosh_08_windowblinds-typography_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Identity for Kaibosh by Snask\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kaibosh_08_windowblinds-typography_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Identity for Kaibosh by Snask\" \/>\n<figcaption>Prop window blinds with type.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The other element in the identity is a custom font in a heavy weight and condensed style that feels both industrious and cool and, in typical Snask fashion, takes on dimensionality and plays with unexpected props in enchanting ways. Blue blinds? Yeah, that&#8217;s not an idea that comes naturally, yet makes perfect sense when seen through the Snask distortion filter.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kaibosh_animation_shades-grades.gif\" alt=\"New Identity for Kaibosh by Snask\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kaibosh_animation_eyes-guys.gif\" alt=\"New Identity for Kaibosh by Snask\" \/>\n<figcaption>Type animations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>More of these, please!<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kaibosh_02_various_materials.jpg\" alt=\"New Identity for Kaibosh by Snask\" \/>\n<figcaption>Various materials.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kaibosh_03_notebooks.jpg\" alt=\"New Identity for Kaibosh by Snask\" \/>\n<figcaption>Notebooks.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kaibosh_20_coffee-mugs.jpg\" alt=\"New Identity for Kaibosh by Snask\" \/>\n<figcaption>Coffee cups.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>In application, the typography takes over most canvases in playful ways with copywriting leading the way &#8212; &#8220;It&#8217;s a wrap&#8221; wrapping tape?
