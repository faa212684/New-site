Financial pundits saw this as a quick route for Bloomberg, the successful, finance-oriented media outlet started by the mayor of New York, to a strong presence in print. More to the point, it was viewed as an opportunity to make Bloomberg, the unseen hand behind so many news feeds and stock tickers, more of a household name. And so it came to be. Their name now graces the living rooms and reception areas of millions of homes and businesses across the world, announcing its debut by turning a new page in <em>BusinessWeek<\/em>&#8216;s 80-year history.<\/p><!--more--><p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bloomberg-businessweek-before-after.gif\" width=\"574\" height=\"260\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">The new logo for Bloomberg <em>BusinessWeek<\/em>, featuring their custom drawing of Helvetica, represents a small piece of the overall redesign<\/p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/2010\/04\/22\/news\/companies\/bloomberg_businessweek.fortune\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fortune<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote>The magazine&#8217;s 4.5 million readers were a big draw for Bloomberg. That&#8217;s 4.5 million more impressions of Bloomberg as a brand name provider of business content. Its own Bloomberg Markets print title is distributed to only its roughly 300,000 terminal users. And while 80 million people may read Bloomberg wire copy, most read it syndicated in newspapers worldwide.<\/blockquote>\n<p><em>BusinessWeek<\/em> is one of the few magazines that I subscribe to at home. I am as guilty as the next person of lazily consuming most of my news online and I have always felt that <em>BusinessWeek<\/em> made for a nice exception to this routine. Their content fits snuggly within the cross-section of business and design, two topics indispensable to a branding employee. Unlike so many magazines these days, <em>BusinessWeek<\/em> still seemed worth the time to read and the money to subscribe to (i.e., relevant).<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bloomberg-businessweek-spreads-before.jpg\" width=\"574\" height=\"430\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Select spreads from the previous <em>BusinessWeek<\/em> magazine&mdash;simple typography, bold use of red and austere layouts helped create a strong voice and compelling hierarchy<\/p>\n<p>This is the  second major redesign for <em>BusinessWeek<\/em> in less than three years. It was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/<em>BusinessWeek<\/em>_drops_the_serifs.php&#8221;>last covered<\/a> by Brand New in October of 2007 to generally positive reviews. My overall impression of the past design was that it was strong, streamlined and deliberate. It made unreserved use of the (brand) color red. The hierarchy was as flat as possible. The editors didn&#8217;t let the organization or sectioning of the publication interfere with their no-nonsense journalism.<\/p>\n<p>The overview of the new magazine tells a very different story.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bloomberg-businessweek-spreads-after.jpg\" width=\"574\" height=\"430\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Select spreads from the redesigned Bloomberg <em>BusinessWeek<\/em>, which trades focus for flexibility, diversity and a general robustness of content<\/p>\n<p>The new design makes room for more content, more sections and more advertising. The creators have introduced a new palette of typefaces (trading Akzidenz for Helvetica) along with rigorous &mdash; and sometimes obtrusive &mdash; color-coding. Red is hardly used at all and Bloomberg&#8217;s orange is curiously absent (except, of course, for color-coding).  The new logo is beautifully set, but seems to miss some of the warmth and ownability of the last mark.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bloomberg-businessweek-cover-detail.jpg\" width=\"574\" height=\"220\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">The redesigned cover does a better job of exposing the contents through a sneak peak section running along the top<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s hard for me to be critical of the new design, very capably executed by Richard Turley of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.markporter.com\/notebook\/?p=768\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Guardian<\/em> fame<\/a>. As a designer I really appreciate a lot of the craft and nuance that went into this new design. I mean, who doesn&#8217;t appreciate a gorgeous, soup-to-nuts <a href=\"http:\/\/christianschwartz.com\/haasgrotesk.shtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">redrawing<\/a> of Helvetica? The new type features better kerning, balance, capitals that line up with numerals and great character alternates like this capital &#8216;R.&#8217;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bloomberg-businessweek-typography.gif\" width=\"569\" height=\"130\" alt=\"Opening Remarks\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Haas Helvetica, drawn by Christian Schwarz (on top), compared to Helvetica Neue LT (on bottom)<\/p>\n<p>But as a reader, I was  a little disappointed.  What I really liked about the previous design was its strong point of view in a sea of similar publications. It seemed like a magazine for the internet age: expedient and timely. Now, of course, the redesign has been hailed as a new magazine for a web-savvy, post-print world. Paradoxically, this design is supposed to be better because of the longer engagement it encourages (or requires, depending on how you look at it) by delving deeper. The previous design was a fast read and I appreciated it.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bloomberg-businessweek-section-detail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"574\" height=\"388\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><em>Bloomberg BusinessWeek<\/em> detail spread of their technology section is crowded and hard to follow<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bloomberg-businessweek-section-openers.jpg\" width=\"574\" height=\"261\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">The section openers provide some brief respites of calm<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bloomberg-businessweek-section-etc.jpg\" width=\"574\" height=\"261\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">The final department at the end of each issue is called &#8220;Etc.&#8221; and it contains some odds and ends meant to add a little levity (and many levels of hierarchy)<\/p>\n<p>Critiquing a magazine is tricky (especially over the lo-res web) because it&#8217;s difficult to separate the design decisions from the editorial ones. Given the amount of content and space on each page, the design team has done an admirable job organizing information and ensuring that it&#8217;s all scannable, legible and interesting. My issue, if I have one, is the jack-of-all-trades, overstuffed nature of this new incarnation. It might be that this is simply their maiden issue, which will be refined over time, but the whole thing reads a little too much like a catalogue right now. And the tone, brand, point of view, whatever you call it, seems to be a little watered down.<\/p>\n<p>Defining the future of print is a fool&#8217;s errand and I&#8217;ll be curious to see how this particular vision pans out. The sad fact is that we will have fewer and fewer magazines. It&#8217;s a crowded space of shrinking relevance and there will really be only a handful of spots for singularly great publications.  While <em>Bloomberg BusinessWeek<\/em> is well-designed and backed by the strength and prowess of Bloomberg Media, I wonder if it is unique enough in purpose and point of view to survive. Of course, the only way to appreciate the new design will be to go to an actual store and check it out.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_100610_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_100610_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"285\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_100610_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_100610_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"285\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_100610_config_03.xml&#038;xyz=poll_100610_votes_03.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"285\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv3\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv3\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":6,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[12,82,26],"tags":[193,194,195,196,197],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1118"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/6"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1118"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1118\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1118"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1118"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1118"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
