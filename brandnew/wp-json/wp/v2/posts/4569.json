The identity, designed by Yerevan, Armenia-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.backbonebranding.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Backbone Branding<\/a>, channels both of these traits through a set of minimal, abstract icons representing elements from nature like sun, water, fruit, tree, elk, fish, and birds. These can then be used in three ways: as a single large element, in a straight step-and-repeat pattern, or a freeform composition where the icons break away. In either configuration, the icons look beautiful in their black and white applications against all this good-looking food and containers. The minimal M\u00d8S logo in a thick and thin sans serif is a perfect accent point for all the patterns. Definitely click through the link to see the rest of the applications.  <a href=\"http:\/\/www.backbonebranding.com\/#\/mos-gastronomic-smartcasual\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Bombay Electric by Michael Thorsby<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_bombay_electric.jpg\" alt=\"Bombay Electric by Michael Thorsby\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bombayelectric.in\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bombay Electric<\/a> is a curated fashion and design store in the heart of Mumbai, bringing together products from around the country. Its new identity and packaging have been designed by Paris, France-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.michaelthorsby.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Michael Thorsby<\/a> who put the electric in, well, Bombay Electric. Because the packaging looks so surreal (and almost unreal) I had to confirm with him that these were actually produced &#8212; I mean, what client approves <em>and<\/em> produces gorgeous stuff like this?! &#8212; and, indeed, they are. The gradients are achieved through Illustrator&#8217;s mesh tool and printed offset (or litho) in a pearlescent paper which make it even more electric. The assault of color from the packaging is tempered by a minimal, generously letterspaced sans serif with a vibrating &#8220;I&#8221; that &#8220;represents the restless curiosity that Bombay Electric stands for&#8221;. Shockingly good! <a href=\"http:\/\/www.michaelthorsby.com\/Bombay-Electric-Identity-5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Harvard xDesign by Pentagram<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_failure.jpg\" alt=\"Harvard xDesign Conference by Pentagram\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.harvardxdesign.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Harvard xDesign<\/a> is an annual conference hosted by the Harvard Graduate School of Design, Harvard Business School, and Harvard College, revolving around the theme of, yes, design and this year&#8217;s conference identity by New York, NY-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pentagram.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pentagram<\/a> partner Natasha Jen is a total, utter failure. That&#8217;s a compliment, btw. The theme of this year&#8217;s event is failure and the the logo shows the word failing to stay straight and do as letters do. You could almost see the logo appear on <a href=\"http:\/\/youhadonejob.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">You had one job!<\/a> The logo or typographic hero image is used mostly as seven repeating lines of the word &#8220;FAILURE&#8221; (one line for each letter) and I like how that represents failing seven times and not being able to get it right in the first, second, or seventh try. The logo also works nicely as a single line (as seen on the pencil).
