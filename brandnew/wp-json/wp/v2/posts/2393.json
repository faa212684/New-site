The organization funds research, sets standards of CF care, and provides information and advice to people with CF and their families. But the main challenge with CF remains: explaining what it is and raising awareness. &#8220;Cystic fibrosis,&#8221; explains the Trust &#8220;is chronically misunderstood, kills thousands worldwide and is carried unknowingly in the genes of millions. It&#8217;s often invisible to the naked eye yet destroys lives, stopping them short, inflicting hardship and distress on patients, their families and carers. Cystic fibrosis directly affects around 10,000 people in the UK.&#8221; Today, the Cystic Fibrosis Trust has launched a new identity-slash-campaign designed by London-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.johnsonbanks.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">johnson banks<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cystic_fibrosis_old_stuff.jpg\" alt=\"Cystic Fibrosis Trust Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Sample of old look. Not designed by johnson banks.<\/p>\n<blockquote>We discovered that supporters of the charity feel that the general awareness and understanding of cystic fibrosis among the general public is very low.

Mid-way through the research stage we had a breakthrough when we noticed the &#8216;is&#8217; at the end of &#8216;fibrosis&#8217;. So we suggested the charity should activate the &#8216;is&#8217; in their name with a series of statements, effectively forcing it to always explain what it is, does, and why they are here.<br \/>&mdash; johnson banks project description<\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cystic_fibrosis_message_01.gif\" alt=\"Cystic Fibrosis Trust Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cystic_fibrosis_message_02.gif\" alt=\"Cystic Fibrosis Trust Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cystic_fibrosis_message_03.gif\" alt=\"Cystic Fibrosis Trust Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Custom handwritten font by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.g-type.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nick Cooke<\/a>.<\/p>\n<blockquote>Some are simple: &#8216;cystic fibrosis why we&#8217;re here&#8217;, some uplifting &#8216;cystic fibrosis a battle we must win&#8217;, some hard-hitting &#8211; &#8216;cystic fibrosis a life sentence&#8217;. The Trust now has at least 40 sentences they can use, and we are adding to them continually.

It almost goes without saying but this is truly smart and fantastic work &mdash; on its own and even more so in contrast with the old look and feel. All of a sudden, the Cystic Fibrosis Trust brand is a walking, talking educational tool that is as simple as it gets, explaining in the own terms and words of people affected by the disease why they should pay attention. Almost annoyingly simple the logo takes a few tired clich&eacute;s &mdash; Helvetica, highlighter bars, and handwritten elements &mdash; to serve as the foundation for a striking identity that is both serious and playful; with the wrong execution these same elements could have turned out cloying and childish.
