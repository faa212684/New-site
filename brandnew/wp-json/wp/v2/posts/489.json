Hell, you may have even voted for Sanjaya Malakar. Kids, futures, democracy&hellip; it&#8217;s all serious business worth voting for. Behold\ufffdthe winning entry (designed free) among more than 275 designs submitted by district students and staff members.<\/p><!--more--><p>The new blue logo,\ufffd<a href=\"http:\/\/www.dallasnews.com\/sharedcontent\/dws\/dn\/latestnews\/stories\/020907dnmetdisdlogo.647e4ea8.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">according to a report in the <em>Dallas Morning News<\/em><\/a>, was to help brand the school district as a &#8220;reinvigorated, progressive organization&#8221;. What came out, though, was &#8220;dull, busy and marred by student figures reminiscent of Pillsbury Doughboys,&#8221; according to some trustees at DISD&#8217;s board briefing.<\/p>\n<p>District administrators had hoped the recommended logo &mdash; three student figures in red, white and blue beneath five stars in the frame of a big blue &#8220;D&#8221; &mdash; would bolster their efforts to improve the Dallas Independent School District&#8217;s image.\ufffdBut some trustees were upset they weren&#8217;t consulted about the design. One trustee thought it looked &#8220;real busy.&#8221; Another thought the figures of the students looked a &#8220;little goofy&#8221; and, eventually, came the Pillsbury Doughboy comparison. Laslty, another said the design did not represent Dallas&#8217; &#8220;macho&#8221; image.\ufffd<\/p>\n<p>In the end, Superintendent Michael Hinojosa took the blame for the unpopular design.\ufffd&#8221;It was me that moved this thing forward,&#8221; Dr. Hinojosa said. He added that the logo was shown to executive staff members and that they had approved it.\ufffd<\/p>\n<p>What stuck in my craw in this scenario wasn&#8217;t the fact that Mr. Hinojosa had gone to his students and staff members to seek entries or that someone had found a loophole (Partiot Act-style) and skirted the board. Rather, the logo being replaced is a classic, timeless mark created by the legendary identity firm\ufffd<a href=\"http:\/\/www.rbmm.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">RBMM<\/a>. In the end, however all sanity may be restored as Hinojosa&#8217;s Sanjaya is laid to rest for the time being, with a new presentation <em>with<\/em> the board happening soon.
