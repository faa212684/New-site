Last time I was in Toronto I walked for a good 15 minutes to get to some distant terminal &mdash; that thing is huge. It&#8217;s not often that we cover airport identity here on Brand New, we&#8217;ve done <a href=\"http:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/mt_bn\/mt-search.cgi?IncludeBlogs=9&#038;search=airport\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">three in the last five years<\/a>, and that&#8217;s because it&#8217;s not a typically exciting niche in identity design but Pearson is certainly making a big deal of it. And I&#8217;m not saying that in a mocking way, it&#8217;s just interesting that they are very consciously branding their airport and trying to do so in a consumer-friendly way. Yesterday, as many of our Canadian readers alerted me, Toronto Pearson International Airport introduced a new identity.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>&#8220;The logo&#8217;s multiple, vibrant colours represent the cultural diversity of Toronto and the world we provide access to.  Together, the lines create a human figure that is embracing and reaching out to the world,&#8221; says Pamela Griffith-Jones.  &#8220;For You. The World&#8221; puts our customers at the centre of it all, conveying our commitment to being the ultimate host while reminding them of our global reach.&#8221;<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.torontopearson.com\/pearson_leftNavOneColumnWF.aspx?pageid=78&#038;id=6442452175\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press Release<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pearson_airport_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"Toronto Pearson International Airport\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pearson_airport_livery.jpg\" alt=\"Toronto Pearson International Airport\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pearson_airport_banner.jpg\" alt=\"Toronto Pearson International Airport\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pearson_airport_kiosks.jpg\" alt=\"Toronto Pearson International Airport\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Nothing much to say about the old logo, as it was just the combination of the GTAA&#8217;s (Greater Toronto Airports Authority) logo and some serif type. My initial reaction to the new logo is that it isn&#8217;t very good, it&#8217;s a kind of &#8220;primitive&#8221; idea &mdash; arrows making a human figure, you know, bringing people to one destination &mdash; as well as an almost primitive drawing that you might find etched on a cave next to the depiction of a buffalo. It&#8217;s not necessarily well done, it isn&#8217;t clear whether the lines are arrows or just random triangles that sometimes sprout a middle stick, the colors are a very strange combination, and the stick figure is a male (which could or could not be an issue for some or none). But for an airport identity I think it&#8217;s one of the most memorable ones (perhaps not for the right reasons), it stands out and for the millions of less-than-visually-discerning passengers that go through there it will probably come across as a friendly, colorful welcome mat.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to Umar Shahzad for first tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_110608_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_110608_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_110608_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_110608_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[60,9,26],"tags":[150,105,42,556],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1492"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1492"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1492\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1492"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1492"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1492"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
