Headquartered in Bras\u00edlia, Wixx&#8217;s network is available in 45 cities across Brazil and they have recently started offering residential services as well. Earlier this year, Wixx introduced a new identity designed by S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil-based <a href=\"http:\/\/brbauen.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BR\/BAUEN<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>[We] looked into understanding the verbal and visual language necessary to ensure that Wixx graduated from being a &#8220;small generic telecom&#8221; to a corporate service &#8220;specialist telecom&#8221;. The first step was to define through brand archetypes, the persona whose personality would guide the process: The Governor, whom with technical mastery, expresses his expertise objectively through a direct tone of voice and total control.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/brbauen.com\/en\/projects\/wixx-telecom-branding\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BR\/BAUEN project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/wixx_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Wixx by BR\/BAUEN\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>To support this discourse, we created the visual identity and its elements for maximum objectivity and identification: Wixx wordmark and short signature &#8220;W.&#8221;, a graphic compositions language (inspired by transmission and responsiveness) which is extended to all printed material randomly. The chromatic palette was reduced to 3 colors, where black and copper predominate and with a tone of voice adjustment that establishes their perception at the desired balancing level: Wixx are experts, &#8220;for today or forever&#8221;, where &#8216;today&#8217; = events and &#8216;forever&#8217; = fixed networks &#8211; which become the brand&#8217;s tagline.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/brbauen.com\/en\/projects\/wixx-telecom-branding\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BR\/BAUEN project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/wixx_logo_animation.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Wixx by BR\/BAUEN\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo animation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo could have been passable without the big blue circle and some more convincing Wi-Fi signal graphics but, in the end, it looked like it belonged to an internet caf\u00e9 more than a business-to-business organization. The new logo, to be perfectly honest, I have no idea why it looks the way it does but I kind of love it for that same reason. It&#8217;s like grungy and <em>Matrix<\/em>-y but somehow manages to look corporate. I would have liked it more without the thin lines connecting each letter &#8212; which I get that they convey connectivity &#8212; so as to let the funky letterforms shine. I also don&#8217;t think the period is necessary but if they wanted something at the end of the word, rotating the tittle of the &#8220;i&#8221; 90 degrees to create more of an underscore graphic could have been interesting&#8230; which they sort of do in the animation. I realize I have a lot of &#8220;but&#8221;s about the logo <em>but<\/em> I do really like it simply for being so weird and breaking with 2019 conventions (2019 the year; not 2,019 the quantity).<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/wixx_logo_info_lockups.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Wixx by BR\/BAUEN\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo lock-ups with supporting information.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>Considering the importance of the typographic voice for conveying corporate messages, we created a custom typographic family. An alphabet inspired by monospaced fonts, widely used in contexts perceived as technological, typography of code lines, a visual language that with coherent institutional brand messaging &#8211; enables us to develop all brand touchpoints necessary for the positioning shift.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/brbauen.com\/en\/projects\/wixx-telecom-branding\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BR\/BAUEN project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/wixx_custom_type_01.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Wixx by BR\/BAUEN\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/wixx_custom_type_02.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Wixx by BR\/BAUEN\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/wixx_custom_type_03.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Wixx by BR\/BAUEN\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/wixx_custom_type_04.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Wixx by BR\/BAUEN\" \/>\n<figcaption>Custom typeface.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The custom typeface is pretty nice, offering a relatively fresh take on monospace fonts in a thin weight with some extreme ink trap-slash-notches. (For those of you that know, you know I love me some ink traps.) As I stare at the images above, though, I just realized there are at least two different styles, one with and one without notches. Inspecting their website does indeed confirm two different variations, one for small text and one for headlines.
