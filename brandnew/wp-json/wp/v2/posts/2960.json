The restaurant was launched by Mark Unger, partner and director of interactive of local design firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pushhere.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Push<\/a> and his father-in-law, George (of Nazareth, Israel provenance), the man behind the falafels. The identity was, obviously, designed by Push, who estimate that 40% of their own clients are restaurants so getting involved in a restaurant of their own was like setting up an R&amp;D lab and an opportunity to learn the business from the inside out.<\/p><!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hubbly_bubbly_01_logo.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Hubbly Bubbly by Push\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail and color variations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hubbly_bubbly_02_falafel_1.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Hubbly Bubbly by Push\" \/>\n<figcaption>Falafel cup.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hubbly_bubbly_03_beer.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Hubbly Bubbly by Push\" \/>\n<figcaption>Beer cup!<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hubbly_bubbly_04_shirt.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Hubbly Bubbly by Push\" \/>\n<figcaption>T-shirt<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hubbly_bubbly_05_magnet.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Hubbly Bubbly by Push\" \/>\n<figcaption>Magnets and carry-out bag.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The main logo is an attractive, wobbly bubble with a hand-drawn name that, to me, is a fun metaphor for the imperfect and snowflake quality of falafel balls: they are all unique and not two of them are the same (unless you count deliciousness as being the same). It&#8217;s a fun logo and it&#8217;s been well done &mdash; someone lazier or clumsier would have repeated characters but here it&#8217;s clearly a piece of lettering and not a stock font. The color is a bit unexpected but I guess the bright choices were to make it look more restaurant-y than falafel-y. My main complaint would be the choice of Neutraface Inline as the secondary typeface; it feels too much out of place against the logo and brings in a completely different flavor (pun!) from what&#8217;s being presented.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hubbly_bubbly_06_stickers.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Hubbly Bubbly by Push\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stickers<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hubbly_bubbly_07_georgie.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Hubbly Bubbly by Push\" \/>\n<figcaption>The character is modeled after the owner and main falafel man, George.

He looks like quite the lady-killer and his hair matches the thickness and texture of the main logo. In application, the main logo looks great blown up big on the wall and smack in the center of the disposable dinnerware. And the exterior sign alone is worth a Brand New Review.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Launched in September of 2013, Hubbly Bubbly &mdash; named after a colloquial name for hookah in some places &mdash; is a fast-casual restaurant in Orlando, FL, serving up falafels and shawarma-style chicken and lamb and steak pita pocket sandwiches.
