Its online counterpart, launched in the mid 1990s, receives over 14 million unique visitors a month, with five of those millions being from outside Spain. Like other newspapers online, video has become an integral part of its content, and <em>El Pa\u00eds<\/em> recently introduced a comprehensive identity and approach to <a href=\"http:\/\/epv.elpais.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">El Pa\u00eds Video<\/a> designed by Madrid-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.erretres.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Erretres<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>The goal was to open a new active window to the world with a dynamic and versatile identity that serves as the base of numerous animated resources such as identified themes, signs, graphics, covers, credits, signatures, locations, etc. which a project of these characteristics requires.<br \/><br \/>A window from which El Pa\u00eds, in its most synthetic form, is converted into the brand-curator of reality, thus a window from which it observes the world and shows to the world.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.erretres.com\/?portfolio=el-pais-video\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Erretres project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/150183213?title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo explanation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/el_pais_video_logo.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Online Look for El Pa\u00eds Video by Erretres\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo on imagery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The <em>El Pa\u00eds<\/em> logo is one of the most well-known and recognized logos in Spain, which makes you wonder if all those blackletter newspaper logos have got it wrong in going for the same approach instead of choosing something as basic as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.myfonts.com\/fonts\/bitstream\/clarendon\/?refby=ucllc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Clarendon<\/a>, which is all that the <em>El Pa\u00eds<\/em> logo is. The familiarity with the &#8220;E&#8221; is almost the same as <em>The New York Times<\/em> &#8220;T&#8221; &mdash; who also built <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/new_logo_and_mnemonic_for_times_video_by_work-order.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a concise video platform identity back in 2014<\/a> &mdash; and serves as the basis for the logo along with the ubiquitous play button. There is nothing special about the El Pa\u00eds Video logo; it&#8217;s very simple and basic but it works: You can spot it easily amidst the editorial density of the newspaper&#8217;s website and its two circles, reminiscent of buttons, pack good functionality and subtle cues about the videos.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/el_pais_video_logo_functionality.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Online Look for El Pa\u00eds Video by Erretres\" \/>\n<figcaption>Functionality.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/el_pais_video_logo_bug.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Online Look for El Pa\u00eds Video by Erretres\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo as bug.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/150395773?title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo animation at the beginning of videos.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The main animation that plays at the beginning of the videos is 1 or 2 seconds long and it&#8217;s also simple and to the point, with a brief whoosh-and-boop mnemonic sound that gets you in the mood to watch a video. It does <a href=\"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/93248882\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">look and sound similar to the NYT video logo<\/a>, so to each his own on whether it&#8217;s a coincidence or not.

The second circle of the logo plays a nice role indicating the time expired on the video or introducing the video&#8217;s host.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/el_pais_video_business_card.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Online Look for El Pa\u00eds Video by Erretres\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/el_pais_video_ad.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Online Look for El Pa\u00eds Video by Erretres\" \/>\n<figcaption>Ad.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">The print applications are &#8212; not to sound like a broken record &#8212; simple and effective, if a little dry, but on something like ad directly above, the transparency of the logo works great on top of the photo. The use of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.myfonts.com\/fonts\/fontbureau\/benton-sans\/?refby=ucllc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Benton Sans<\/a> (also on the videos) rounds out the identity quite well.
