Based on a two-year program, Teach First trains first-time teachers through a five-week intensive program before school starts and continues their development in the school where they evolve from an &#8220;unqualified teacher&#8221; to gaining Qualified Teacher Status then becoming a Newly Qualified Teacher and, in the end, gaining a Postgraduate Diploma in Education. The charity has now recruited over 14,000 teachers and leaders, 60 of which have become head teachers, supporting over a million students in the last 17 years. This month, Teach First introduced a new identity designed by London, UK-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonbanks.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Johnson Banks<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/teach_first_before.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Teach First by Johnson Banks\" \/>\n<figcaption>Samples of the previous identity.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>[The] task was to find a bold and differentiating new brand approach which used the new narrative as a springboard, tackled preconceptions and would be digitally led. It needed to reflect their evolution from a charity known just for teacher training, to one offering a range of school leadership programmes, supporting schools and helping teachers to thrive. And finally it had to be adaptable across a bewildering array of target audiences: graduates; teachers; professionals considering &#8216;switching&#8217; to teaching; headmasters; government departments; philanthropists; corporate sponsors, and so on.<br \/><br \/>After extensive design stages and multiple rounds of audience testing, a clear winner emerged that is simple and bold, yet enables Teach First to move in a new direction. The idea begins with a simple T\/F monogram that echoes &#8216;building a fair education for all&#8217; and allows them to clearly identify themselves, from the smallest space on a social post to the largest billboard site.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonbanks.co.uk\/work\/teach-first\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Johnson Banks project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/teach_first_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Teach First by Johnson Banks\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/teach_first_logo_stacked.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Teach First by Johnson Banks\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stacked version.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/teach_first_logo_animation.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo animation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo, clearly, was not very interesting and that same lackluster-ness seeped into the rest of their materials and communications, yielding a fairly bland and unattractive identity. The new logo features a bold monogram that blends a &#8220;T&#8221; and an &#8220;F&#8221; into a strong identifier for the organization. An easy visual puzzle where triangles help define the letters, the monogram has a nice geometric basis to it that ties it to primary education. The wordmark, in a bold, spiky serif looks good and serves as a matching complement to the shapes of the monogram. The stacked version gets a little disproportionate with the huge monogram but it does work in cementing it as the clear mark for the organization.<\/p>\n<blockquote>[We] oversaw photoshoots across the UK featuring school children who were encouraged to be themselves &#8211; real, sometimes cheeky, always human &#8211; rather than fall back on the clich\u00e9d classroom shots that have become the industry standard. We also shot a whole tranche of teachers in a similar style.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonbanks.co.uk\/work\/teach-first\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Johnson Banks project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/teach_first_photo_approach_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Teach First by Johnson Banks\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/teach_first_photo_approach_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Teach First by Johnson Banks\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/teach_first_photo_approach_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Teach First by Johnson Banks\" \/>\n<figcaption>Photography approach.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The design approach continues with a new typographic language, punchy colour palette, bold graphic style and a revised art direction approach. We also introduced a snappier and bolder new tone of voice. Together with a newly developed messaging framework, this encourages Teach First to say less, not more, using straightforward communication in an increasingly jargon-heavy sector.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonbanks.co.uk\/work\/teach-first\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Johnson Banks project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/teach_first_social_squares.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Teach First by Johnson Banks\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/teach_first_social.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Teach First by Johnson Banks\" \/>\n<figcaption>Social media posts.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The identity revolves around some uplifting photography of kids mixed with equally uplifting copywriting that communicates the organization&#8217;s goal of changing the outlook of kids&#8217; futures from a state of apathy to a state of optimism. Visually there are a number of things going on, some better than others. I like the crossed out, lame words replaced with positive words and the cut-corner holding shape for words (the ones that say &#8220;pauses&#8221; or &#8220;rise&#8221; below) but I&#8217;m not as much of a fan of the silhouetted photos with shapes or the combination of the serif with the light sans serif. As a whole, though, it&#8217;s a versatile and varied system to adapt to multiple uses.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/teach_first_brochures.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Teach First by Johnson Banks\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/teach_first_brochures_wide.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Teach First by Johnson Banks\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brochures.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/teach_first_report_cover.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Teach First by Johnson Banks\" \/>\n<figcaption>Report cover.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>Key to this relaunch, their ongoing teacher recruitment and the growth of their schools network is a multi-faceted, multi-channel advertising campaign. We have developed this based upon the idea of the choices that their many target audiences face &#8211; and that by joining or supporting Teach First, you can &#8216;alter the outcome&#8217;. Here are some examples.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonbanks.co.uk\/work\/teach-first\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Johnson Banks project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/teach_first_ab_campaign_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Teach First by Johnson Banks\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/teach_first_ab_campaign_02a.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Teach First by Johnson Banks\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/teach_first_ab_campaign_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Teach First by Johnson Banks\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/teach_first_ab_campaign_04.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Teach First by Johnson Banks\" \/>\n<figcaption>Campaign.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>In the campaign, the silhouetted photos start to look a little cheesy &#8212; it might just be the unnatural bright yellow and blue backgrounds because when they are on black it does look great. The A\/B concept is good and decently executed but I wonder if the ads are relatively &#8220;complex&#8221; to be read on the fly &#8212; I don&#8217;t know if this is just me assuming that people don&#8217;t have the attention span anymore to take 5 seconds to decode an ad because phones. Again, I like the overall tone of how the A and B options point out the attitude of just letting things be vs. the way things could be.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/teach_first_swag.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Teach First by Johnson Banks\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/teach_first_notebook_lanyard_a.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Teach First by Johnson Banks\" \/>\n<figcaption>Various applications.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/teach_first_patches.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Teach First by Johnson Banks\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/teach_first_backpack.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Teach First by Johnson Banks\" \/>\n<figcaption>Patches.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">Overall, this has an interesting aesthetic that feels academic and school-related while managing to also feel career-oriented for young professionals.
