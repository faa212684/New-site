We moved from our 7-Eleven performance space on the outskirts of town to the historic Federal Building located in the cultural heart of the city, historic downtown Gainesville.  We have created an adventurous combination of works, including World, U.S. and East coast premieres. From Tennessee Williams to Paula Vogel, the theatre unites our audiences with the nation&#8217;s most prominent playwrights on our Mainstage. Our Cinema Program presents first-run artistic films, independent films, film festivals and introduces film lovers to the world&#8217;s best filmmakers. Our educational initiatives take theatre into the classroom and bring students into the theatre. Student matinees, talkbacks, observerships, teacher workshops and playgoers guides connect our audiences with the powerful stories on the stage. Our classes and camps inspire creative thinking, teamwork, self expression and personal and academic growth. Our Visual Art Gallery features Florida artists in twelve exhibitions annually and is featured monthly in Art Walk. [&hellip;]The theatre, which is open for public performances 340 days a year, attracts as many as 1,000 people to the downtown area each day. The Hipp provides the most extensive cultural programming in the region with 8 plays, 300 film screenings, 10 festivals, 16 Guest Artists Talkbacks, 12 visual arts exhibitions and hundreds of other programs annually.&#8221;<\/p><!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hippodrome_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Hippodrome Theater by 160over90\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hippodrome_logo_variations.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Hippodrome Theater by 160over90\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sub-logos.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hippodrome_posters.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Hippodrome Theater by 160over90\" \/>\n<figcaption>Posters.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"&quot;The Hippodrome has grown from a tiny theatre group to the only professional theatre in the region.
