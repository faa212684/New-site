With their scope of services growing beyond just tax preparation and into overall financial advising, the organization recently changed their name to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.prepareandprosper.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Prepare + Prosper<\/a> with the help of Minneapolis-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.zeusjones.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Zeus Jones<\/a>, who also designed the new identity.<\/p><!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/prepare_prosper_old_stationery.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Prepare + Prosper by Zeus Jones\" \/>\n<figcaption>Old stationery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/prepare_prosper_old_guidelines.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Prepare + Prosper by Zeus Jones\" \/>\n<figcaption>Old brand guidelines.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>Prepare + Prosper is a clear reflection of the organization: aspirational, but grounded in action. The word &#8220;prepare&#8221; hints at tax preparation while the word &#8220;prosper&#8221; feels financial without being too literal. The name can also be read more broadly, as an idea that points toward a future of financial growth, for individuals and the community as a whole.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.zeusjones.com\/work\/prepare-and-prosper\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Zeus Jones project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<p>As you might be able to tell, this project falls under the not-well-known-brand-yet-good-story category of Reviews. Like any good nonprofit doing valuable work, AccountAbility Minnesota had a bland name with a bland, dated logo and identity to go with it. For the individuals and families it was helping it most likely didn&#8217;t make a difference &mdash; after all, they were getting a service they really needed. A redesign like this helps empower the organization and the volunteers while presenting a more put together appearance to the media, donors, board members, and volunteers. The new name moves from simply stating what it does, &#8220;AccountAbility&#8221;, and where it operates, &#8220;Minnesota&#8221;, to a rallying cry and a goal: Prepare! Prosper! It&#8217;s engaging and energetic.<\/p>\n<blockquote>The surrounding frame and condensed type are inspired by elements found in tax forms, but softened by the round terminals in the lines and letterforms. Carefully applied interchangeable color adds modest energy to the logo. Both logo lockups are balanced by the plus sign, which is another nod to their work in tax preparation. The two primary logos were created using the exact same elements, but arranged in two orientations for a flexible logo system. <\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.zeusjones.com\/work\/prepare-and-prosper\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Zeus Jones project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/prepare_prosper_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Prepare + Prosper by Zeus Jones\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/prepare_prosper_logo_variations.png\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Prepare + Prosper by Zeus Jones\" \/>\n<figcaption>Alternate stacked version (and how the spacing relates in both versions)<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The new logo is a simple wordmark with a thin frame around it. There is probably dozens like it around the world but that&#8217;s fine. It&#8217;s the proper approach for the slightly long name and the execution with the plus sign is relevant. It&#8217;s simple, it&#8217;s elegant, it&#8217;s clean, it&#8217;s well spaced. While they mention that the plus sign references tax preparation I saw it like a <a href=\"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/5\/5b\/Plastic-model-F18.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">plastic model kit<\/a> where the name and plus sign are a neat metaphor for putting your life together.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/prepare_prosper_icons.png\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Prepare + Prosper by Zeus Jones\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icons.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/prepare_prosper_stationery.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Prepare + Prosper by Zeus Jones\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stationery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/prepare_prosper_business_cards.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Prepare + Prosper by Zeus Jones\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/prepare_prosper_guidelines.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Prepare + Prosper by Zeus Jones\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sample guideline pages.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/prepare_prosper_speech_bubble.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Prepare + Prosper by Zeus Jones\" \/>\n<figcaption>Speech bubble device.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/prepare_prosper_brochure.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Prepare + Prosper by Zeus Jones\" \/>\n<figcaption>Print ads.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/prepare_prosper_totebags.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Prepare + Prosper by Zeus Jones\" \/>\n<figcaption>Tote bags.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">In application, the identity is colorful and optimistic with a sprinkling of patterns, icons, and colors that make taxes not feel like total doom. The speech bubble device further expands the use of the plus sign and I like how the bubbles are broken up when going behind the photos of the people. Overall, a great evolution for a well-deserving nonprofit organization and their audience.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1971 by a small group of tax professionals, AccountAbility Minnesota is a community-based nonprofit organization that provides free tax and financial services to low and moderate-income taxpayers in the metro areas of Minneapolis and Saint Paul through the&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,79,26],"tags":[843,769,627,282],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3366"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3366"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3366\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3366"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3366"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3366"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
