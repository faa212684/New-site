Their name comes from their address, 111 Marble Ave. Late last year, Marble started to roll out a new identity and packaging designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ripeinc.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ripe<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/marble_brewery_old_look.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, Packaging for Marble by Ripe\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sampling of the old look.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The Maverick represents our fun-loving, funky, bold, daring, and ever-evolving brand. It holds the marble in its mouth as a symbol of how Albuquerque has embraced Marble. We want to emphasize that we live, brew, and work in Albuquerque, which influences us in unique ways, from the food we eat, to the music we love, to the beer we drink.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.beeradvocate.com\/community\/threads\/albuquerques-marble-brewery-changes-up-logo.206828\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Beer Advocate story<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/marble_brewery_logo_explanation.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, Packaging for Marble by Ripe\" \/>\n<figcaption>The explanation behind the new logo, The Maverick, as displayed on the back of the new growler.

This one was both literal and ugly with some poorly rasterized hops inside a puke-green marble accompanied by a whatever style of typography that thing could be categorized in. The new logo starts with a fun mythical story of a bird that holds a marble in its mouth with an execution that looks decidedly New-Mexico-ish-slash-folk-art. It may not be the best graphic reduction of a bird ever, but it stands as a solid icon and the spark of the blue marble provides a cool contrast to the heaviness of the Maverick. The wordmark is set in House Industries&#8217; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.houseind.com\/fonts\/chaletcomprime\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Chalet Comprim&eacute;<\/a>, which complements the icon quite well.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/marble_brewery_cans.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, Packaging for Marble by Ripe\" \/>\n<figcaption>Cans.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/marble_brewery_bottles.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, Packaging for Marble by Ripe\" \/>\n<figcaption>Bottles.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/marble_brewery_6packs.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, Packaging for Marble by Ripe\" \/>\n<figcaption>Six-packs.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/marble_brewery_boxes.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, Packaging for Marble by Ripe\" \/>\n<figcaption>Boxes.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/marble_brewery_growlers.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, Packaging for Marble by Ripe\" \/>\n<figcaption>Growler.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The packaging is such a vast improvement. Going from the drab cans and bottles (that I think had some parchment paper backgrounds to make them look extra dowdy) to a much more energetic and graphic look with The Maverick as the anchor. A secondary typeface with flared serifs extends the unicase &mdash; *shivers* &mdash; and condensed approach of the logo and looks bold and striking. The cans and bottles are topped with a posterized photographic image that, while it adds an urban feel to the packaging, seems very out of place with the rest of the look. In the bottles, the die-cut of the label follows the image, which is a nice touch.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/marble_brewery_tap_handles.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, Packaging for Marble by Ripe\" \/>\n<figcaption>Tap handles. (These would benefit so much from a good photo). (And I would cut the &#8220;m&#8221;s as feet idea as the bird starts to look like a parrot).<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/marble_brewery_sign.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, Packaging for Marble by Ripe\" \/>\n<figcaption>New sign.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">Overall, this is a great before-and-after case study; mostly due to how bad the old was. The new packaging could use some tightening (and perhaps dropping of the photographic stuff) but it definitely achieves the look of a small, local, cherished brewery.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 2008, Marble is a microbrewery in Albuquerque, New Mexico, that offers six &quot;classics&quot; like pilsner, IPA, and stout, as well as a range of specials, and it operates two tap rooms in the city.
