It&#8217;s like a coffee machine on steroids and a little bit space-age-y with its little packets of powder that you lock into the machine and let it whir. Tassimo&#8217;s system allows different brands to create T Discs of their products and they also produce their own varieties. Since the latter half of last year Tassimo has been introducing its new look in Europe and it seems like this June it started to make its way into the U.S. and other markets around the world full steam ahead. The new look has been designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.turnerduckworth.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Turner Duckworth<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tassimo_package.jpg\" alt=\"Tassimo\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tassimo_package_all.jpg\" alt=\"Tassimo\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tassimo_shapes.jpg\" alt=\"Tassimo\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tassimo_pos.jpg\" alt=\"Tassimo\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Point of Sale kit.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tassimo_boxes.jpg\" alt=\"Tassimo\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The old logo was terrible, with scaled type and a bad rendering of a coffee cup from above. The gold on black color palette was probably conceived with the idea of looking like a luxury product, but it just looked like a cheap highway topless bar. Not that I would know what those look like or anything. The new logo is signature Turner Duckworth. Or is it signature Duffy and Partners? Either way, the new look has that white, airy, colorful, consumer friendly feel that always pleases and that looks great on the shelves at Target. The new logo takes the shape of the T-Discs &mdash; circle with one pointy corner &mdash; to create the icon as well as the &#8220;a&#8221; in the wordmark. The icon is pretty and looks good on the packaging. The wordmark has that annoying is-it-uppercase-is-it-lowercase? combination that I&#8217;ve always found bothersome. The packaging is a giant improvement, and even though it loses some of the colorful-on-white approach what it does extremely well is combining the Tassimo brand with the brands for each beverage, so that it&#8217;s very easy to select a Gevalia, a Tazo, or a Maxwell House. Overall I&#8217;m not a complete fan but it&#8217;s a definite improvement, especially at the consumer level (as opposed to the snotty designer level, a k a me).<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.logotecture.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Logotecture<\/a> for first tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_110706_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_110706_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_110706_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_110706_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_110706_config_03.xml&#038;xyz=poll_110706_votes_03.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv3\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv3\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,51,26],"tags":[170,53,594],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1533"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1533"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1533\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1533"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1533"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1533"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
