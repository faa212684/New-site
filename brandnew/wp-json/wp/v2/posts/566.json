The &#8216;mirror&#8217; effect emphasizes the complexity and diversity of the fund. Their target group is large from classic concerts to concept theater, amateurs and professionals.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/NFPK_image_3.gif\" alt=\"Old Logos\" \/><\/p>\n<p>While the marks for the previous initiatives had their merits &mdash; most notably the the kitsch light-bulb-laden marketing signage and the restrained Olivetti Multiservices-esque usage of an &#8220;O&#8221; &mdash; the new identity for The Netherlands Fund for Performing Arts successfully finds a solution for creating an energetic and contemporary wordmark. What could have easily been a stale mirroring effect is avoided through intelligent choices in not mirroring, or not fully mirroring, certain letters. The &#8220;T \/ +&#8221; and overlapping E letterforms for example, even the squirrly &#8220;S&#8221; seem to work effortlessly at imposing a more asymmetrical visual rhythm. Criticism could be given to the over-emphasis of the &#8220;P&#8221; and &#8220;N&#8221; which abruptly cap the form at either end. In addition, while the logo is large and visually complex it could have difficulty reducing to fit smaller contexts, however this is countered through its keen ability to be oriented both horizontally and vertically. While the applications seen thus far are not groundbreaking, they do a good job of working with the typography and bringing bright colors to a government handled corporate brand. In regards to the readability of &#8220;Podiumkunsten&#8221; perhaps some of our readers fluent in Dutch would have more valued insight.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/NFPK_image_2.gif\" alt=\"Samples\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/NFPK_image_1.jpg\" alt=\"Samples\" \/><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":4,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,63,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/566"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/4"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=566"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/566\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=566"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=566"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=566"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
