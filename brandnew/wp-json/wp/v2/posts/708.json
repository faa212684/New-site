At <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jasonnessa.com\/blog\/?p=117\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">JasonNessa.com<\/a> where I got the logo from, clearly states &#8220;The replicated logo above will give you a very close look of what the new logo looks like, but NOT the exact look.&#8221; which was my oversight. Nonetheless there <em>is<\/em> something odd going on as the logo on the backdrop and the store sign are indeed different.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Founded in 1966 as Sound of Music and renamed to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bestbuy.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Best Buy<\/a> in 1983, the consumer electronics giant is one of the largest and most ubiquitous retailers of its kind with its low prices, khaki-and-blue-polo employee uniforms and slightly deafening store experience. With more than 1,000 locations worldwide Best Buy opened a 45,000-square-foot in Minneapolis&#8217; Mall of America on August 6 and, more thrilling (at least for me) than the August 8th performance and autograph signing by New Kids on the Block, is the new logo that adorns the entrance to the store.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/best_buy_nkotb.jpg\" alt=\"New Kids on the Block at Mall of America\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>New Kids on the Mall.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The yellow tag logo that has become so easily identifiable (thanks in part to being rendered as Yao Ming-sized on the front of their stores) is amazingly almost twenty years old, introduced in 1989, and as recognizable as it is, it probably was time for a reassessment. There is no information anywhere about the new logo, and there is no acknowledgment of the change anywhere on Best Buy&#8217;s web site, so we go by with what we know about design and the brand.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/best_buy_old_logos.gif\" alt=\"Best Buy Old Logos\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>1966 and 1983 logos.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/best_buy_logo_detail_02.gif\" alt=\"Best Buy Logo, Detail\" \/><\/p>\n<p>To me, the move was very explicitly done to soften the look of the old logo and make it feel a little more upscale &mdash; specially in light of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.startribune.com\/business\/30243494.html?elr=KArksLckD8EQDUoaEyqyP4O:DW3ckUiD3aPc:_Yyc:aU7EaDiaMDCiUT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">recent news<\/a> that the latest Best Buy to open in Aurora, Colorado was designed to be more friendly and accessible for women. The old logo definitely felt like it belonged in the $1 bin, perhaps appropriately. The new logo, <strike>set in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.myfonts.com\/fonts\/agfa\/neo-sans\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Neo Sans<\/a><\/strike> <strike>in a modern sans serif<\/strike> set in a modified version of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.processtypefoundry.com\/typefaces\/klavika\/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Klavika<\/a> and with a refined tag, feels contemporary and fresh, I wonder though if it&#8217;s too big of a departure from the original but it may have been hard to achieve a softer look working within the tag. I do like the new logo, even more so as I never quite liked the old one. Hopefully we will eventually learn more about the new identity. In the meantime here are some Flickr-pulled images from the new store at the Mall of America.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/best_buy_moa_01.jpg\" alt=\"Best Buy at the Mall of America\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/djcn0te\/2832431984\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Photo by djcn0te<\/a>.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/best_buy_moa_02.jpg\" alt=\"Best Buy at the Mall of America\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/trypnotic\/2744640386\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Photo by trypnotic<\/a>.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/best_buy_moa_03.jpg\" alt=\"Best Buy at the Mall of America\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/ronaldhennessy\/2759967671\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Photo by ronaldhennessy<\/a>.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Thanks to Nick Oelke for first tip.
