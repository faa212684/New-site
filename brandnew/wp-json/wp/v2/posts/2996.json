Although the models alone manage to make this often-laughable clothing choice look cool (and kinda hot), the identity and packaging designed by Saint Petersburg, Russia-based <a href=\"http:\/\/eskimodesign.ru\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Eskimo<\/a> make it clear that these sweaters are no laughing matter. Designed around a great, minimal abstraction of a deer using the shape of a stitch, the identity feels contemporary, earthy, and hip while letting the sweaters take all the lavish attention they deserve. <a href=\"http:\/\/eskimodesign.ru\/projects\/deerz\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Allsorts by Bond<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_allsorts.jpg\" alt=\"Allsorts by Bond\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">I&#8217;m still not a 100% positive on the brand architecture and where the &#8220;Allsorts&#8221; licorice product falls but from what I understand and so that we can move on to talk about how tasty the boxes above are I&#8217;ll summarize by assuming that Malaco is one of the brand names from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cloetta.fi\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cloetta<\/a>, a Finnish confectioner, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cloetta.fi\/tuotteet\/tuote\/malaco-allsorts-1kg\/132815\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">under which this line of licorice is sold<\/a>. Regardless, all that matters is: Finnish, licorice, packaging, pretty. Designed by Helsinki-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bond.fi\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bond<\/a>, the boxes and bags for Allsorts take cross-sections of the shapes and colors of each piece of licorice and abstract them to be rendered huge. And they look superbly fun, specially in contrast to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.netanttila.com\/images\/catalog\/zoom\/Malaco-Englannin_lakritsi-8193864_malli.jpg target=\"_blank\">the old design<\/a>. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bond.fi\/allsorts\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Visualaz by Re:<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_visualaz.jpg\" alt=\"Visualaz by Re:\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">Specializing in short film production for weddings and corporate clients, Brooklyn-based <a href=\"http:\/\/visualaz.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Visualaz<\/a> now has its own pithy, three-arc story to tell with an identity designed by Sydney-based <a href=\"http:\/\/re-sydney.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Re:<\/a>. With a beginning, middle and end as the basis, the identity is visually and verbally playful, turning everything from a pencil to a mug into a Shakesperean tale. Sort of. A nice reminder that words can play an important role in identity and that it&#8217;s not just about flexible doodads and graphic gizmos.
