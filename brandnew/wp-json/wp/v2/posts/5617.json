Vertical Latin typography for Asian subjects is not entirely novel, but the execution in this instance, by Austin, TX-based <a href=\"http:\/\/fodastudio.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">F\u00d6DA<\/a>, offers a fresh take with a thin, wispy, condensed font set tightly between vertical lines that echo the facade of the restaurant. Additionally, a beautiful combination of textures &#8212; newspaper scans and other Illustrator-y patterns in red and blue hues are used generously throughout the restaurant&#8217;s materials. It&#8217;s too bad not so many people smoke anymore because those matchbooks are lit&#8230; and may be never be actually lit. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/fodastudio.com\/projects\/top-knot\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Eight Elements by Made Somewhere <\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_eightelements.jpg\" alt=\"Eight Elements by Made Somewhere\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/eight_elements\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Eight Elements<\/a> is a ceramic and sculpture studio in Sydney, Australia. Dunno why eight, but that&#8217;s the key element for the logo by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.madesomewhere.com.au\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Made Somewhere<\/a> that arranges three circles to form a lovely, simple icon that is almost too annoyingly simple and annoyingly lovely. The wordmark is nicely spaced and it&#8217;s so satisfying that it&#8217;s the same thickness as the icon. The &#8220;8&#8221; masked inside the circle also looks like it could be a piece of jewelery or its own sculpture. Maybe it&#8217;s already done but I would love to see the logo as an actual brand to mark each sculpture. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/53725837\/Eight-Elements\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Rr\u00eby by Firmalt<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_rrey.jpg\" alt=\"Rr\u00eby by Firmalt\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.cervezarrey.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rr\u00eby<\/a> is a craft beer brewed in Monterrey, Mexico, with attitude to spare. The name is a play on words where &#8220;rey&#8221; means king but is also the last part of Monte<em>rrey<\/em> while the umlauts are taken from K\u00f6lsch, which is their signature beer style. The wordmark is a bold, irreverent serif with a great presence and somewhat awkward forms that add to the overall confidence of the brand. The supporting typography could be a little bit better (or at least given more space to breathe) but the packaging and other materials strike a convincing balance of traditional beer aesthetics with craft beer quirkiness. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.firmalt.com\/project\/rrey\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Thin lines and fun typography come together in this week&apos;s selections with work from Austin, Sydney, and Monterrey&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[51,69,11,85,26],"tags":[184,53,564],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5617"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=5617"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5617\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=5617"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=5617"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=5617"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
