Chronicling all things technology, creative and sometimes just plain bizarre, <a href=\"http:\/\/boingboing.net\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Boing Boing<\/a> has been an assured time waster for its thousands of readers for what seems like a blogging eternity. I realize that a blog is kind of off topic amidst the corporations, universities and consumer products we regularly feature on Brand New but in terms of impact, for a broadly niche audience, few entities can outpace Boing Boing. So as a fellow blogger I thought it would be nice to acknowledge identity design within our shared medium of communication.<\/p><!--more--><p>Committed Boing Boing readers will quickly point out that the After logo is actually an old logo, and they would be right. It was designed by Boing Boing co-founder Mark Frauenfelder and was used from 1999 until 2007, when it was replaced by another pixelated wordmark designed by pixel-happy <a href=\"http:\/\/hello.eboy.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">eBoy<\/a>, and helped establish a look that would ooze into other Boing Boing ventures like <a href=\"http:\/\/gadgets.boingboing.net\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Boing Boing Gadgets<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.boingboing.net\/video.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Boing Boing Video<\/a>. All of it, a kind of crude visual attitude &mdash; the pixelated equivalent of a zine no less. This past October, Boing Boing <a href=\"http:\/\/boingboing.net\/2009\/10\/06\/boing-boing-the-worl.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">redesigned its web site<\/a>, to a mixed review worth 285 comments, and brought back Mark&#8217;s old logo, which I always preferred to the eBoy one. Gone too, for now at least, is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gama-go.com\/product.php?productid=16831&#038;cat=290&#038;page=1#\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jackhammer Jill<\/a>, who had stood by the logo for a long time.<\/p>\n<p>But as much as I liked the original logo, I couldn&#8217;t help but wish it had been pushed a little further and evolved. The letterforms and pixel construction lend themselves to plenty of visual play and for a site that derives much of its pleasure from the fun that the internet brings it would have been nice to embrace some of that variety and unexpectedness of the web. Or at the very least, the gridnik in me would have liked to see the counterspaces be a little more even and create a much more rhythmic set of tig","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_20091103_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_20091103_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"574\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,82,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/961"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=961"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/961\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=961"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=961"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=961"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
