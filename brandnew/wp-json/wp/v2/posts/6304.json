In 2017, RBSF introduced a new identity designed by Ghent, Belgium-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.henkwillems.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Henk Willems<\/a> and Wuustwezel, Belgium-based <a href=\"http:\/\/jelenapeeters.be\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jelena Peeters<\/a> (who, aside from being a graphic designer, happens to be an Olympic speed skater for Belgium) and their work culminated at this year&#8217;s Winter Olympics with their design of the country&#8217;s speed skating uniform.<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Royal_Belgian_Speedskating_Federation_logo_old.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Uniforms for RBSF by Henk Willems and Jelena Peeters\" \/>\n<figcaption>Old logo, detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote><strong>Passion into motion<\/strong><br \/>&#8216;Speedskating is all about passion for speed. RBSF shares that passion, and that&#8217;s why we understand and support belgian speedskaters by lifting up their ambitions to become the best. To communicate this message, we developed a powerul visual identity system that works across every touchpoint that our members, teams, spectators, sponsors, officials, the media and athletes would come into contact with.&#8217;<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.henkwillems.com\/royal-belgian-skating-federation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Henk Willems project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Royal_Belgian_Speedskating_Federation_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Uniforms for RBSF by Henk Willems and Jelena Peeters\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>A logo-set of four different logos was created. The basic shape is based upon the actual shape a speedskater takes while skating. The &#8216;B&#8217; also refers to Belgium. Combined with a robust, stylish typeface, this approach future-proofs the identity, allowing it to evolve without abandoning its roots.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.henkwillems.com\/royal-belgian-skating-federation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Henk Willems project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Royal_Belgian_Speedskating_Federation_logos.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Uniforms for RBSF by Henk Willems and Jelena Peeters\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo variations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Royal_Belgian_Speedskating_Federation_logo_belgian.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Uniforms for RBSF by Henk Willems and Jelena Peeters\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo in Dutch.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo was kind of adorable in how un-logo-like it was. The skater illustration, I could actually see that on a t-shirt with a vintage flavor working really well and there was something superhero-ish about them. Not sure about that lonely skater on the other side. The typography on it&#8230; well, yeah, that was somewhat painful. The new logo brings the organization quickly into this new century with an angled &#8220;B&#8221; monogram that, although I&#8217;m not sure I completely see the &#8220;actual shape a speedskater takes while skating&#8221;, conveys a sense of speed and sharpness. The monogram works best when the patterns inside look clearly masked as opposed to the one directly above where the graphics look like they could be separate pieces making the &#8220;B&#8221; and the one in the wireframe style looks very awkward. The wordmark is a condensed monospace that looks good &#8212; if a little static and heavy &#8212; but does a good job in minimizing the space needed to present the organization&#8217;s full name.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Royal_Belgian_Speedskating_Federation_team_belgium_graphics.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Uniforms for RBSF by Henk Willems and Jelena Peeters\" \/>\n<figcaption>Graphics.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Royal_Belgian_Speedskating_Federation_business_cards_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Uniforms for RBSF by Henk Willems and Jelena Peeters\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Royal_Belgian_Speedskating_Federation_business_cards_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Uniforms for RBSF by Henk Willems and Jelena Peeters\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Royal_Belgian_Speedskating_Federation_business_cards_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Uniforms for RBSF by Henk Willems and Jelena Peeters\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Royal_Belgian_Speedskating_Federation_banners.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Uniforms for RBSF by Henk Willems and Jelena Peeters\" \/>\n<figcaption>Banners.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Royal_Belgian_Speedskating_Federation_nametag.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Uniforms for RBSF by Henk Willems and Jelena Peeters\" \/>\n<figcaption>Name badges.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Royal_Belgian_Speedskating_Federation_website.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Uniforms for RBSF by Henk Willems and Jelena Peeters\" \/>\n<figcaption>Website.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Royal_Belgian_Speedskating_Federation_tote.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Uniforms for RBSF by Henk Willems and Jelena Peeters\" \/>\n<figcaption>Tote.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Royal_Belgian_Speedskating_Federation_podium.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Uniforms for RBSF by Henk Willems and Jelena Peeters\" \/>\n<figcaption>Podium.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The angled graphic patterns are pretty cool&#8230; obviously, very Belgian in their color palette, which makes for a bold color combination that becomes even more striking with the thick lines, hard angles, and dashes of white.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Royal_Belgian_Speedskating_Federation_uniforms_old.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Uniforms for RBSF by Henk Willems and Jelena Peeters\" \/>\n<figcaption>OLD uniforms.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The design uses a specific set of graphical patterns as a visual metaphor for the speed and power of the Belgian speed skating athletes.

The graphic patterns are beautifully integrated into different places in the uniform and they look particularly bad-ass on the yellow sleeves. It has a great balance of solid colors with enough accents to make a statement without it looking like a costume. The asymmetry on the back is pretty cool too.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Royal_Belgian_Speedskating_Federation_uniform_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Uniforms for RBSF by Henk Willems and Jelena Peeters\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Royal_Belgian_Speedskating_Federation_uniform_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Uniforms for RBSF by Henk Willems and Jelena Peeters\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Royal_Belgian_Speedskating_Federation_uniform_04.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Uniforms for RBSF by Henk Willems and Jelena Peeters\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Royal_Belgian_Speedskating_Federation_uniform_05.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Uniforms for RBSF by Henk Willems and Jelena Peeters\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Royal_Belgian_Speedskating_Federation_uniform_06.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Uniforms for RBSF by Henk Willems and Jelena Peeters\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Royal_Belgian_Speedskating_Federation_uniform_07.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Uniforms for RBSF by Henk Willems and Jelena Peeters\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Royal_Belgian_Speedskating_Federation_uniform_08.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Uniforms for RBSF by Henk Willems and Jelena Peeters\" \/>\n<figcaption>A lot more uniform pictures.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">Overall, this is fun, bold, attractive, and appropriate for an exciting sport.
