The first set of print ads came earlier this year and the now infamous logo with a squirrel on it has been popping up regularly but for some reason there is a rekindled interest in this story and some fun material has come up, so we are happy to give this the attention it deserves.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/i_heart_ny_logo_all.gif\" alt=\"I Heart New York Logo, Variations\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The biggest concern when I read about Saatchi getting the job was that they would be a little too eager to change the 1977 logo designed by Milton Glaser, in an attempt to get some attention and show how clever advertising agencies can be. Luckily, the I &hearts; NY remains the same&hellip; except that it has grown some actively annoying clip art appendages. These, along with the print ads, are meant to show how diverse New York is and to establish the I &hearts; NY icon as representative of the whole state, not just Manhattan.<\/p>\n<p>In theory, the idea seems good, to activate the logo in different ways, but the execution is so timid and half-hearted that it is barely convincing or engaging and, at best, it looks like the cheap knock-offs that the The Empire State Development Corporation fights so furiously in getting off the market. The print ads are actually not bad; the illustrations lend an interesting contrast to the usual tourism ads, giving it a somewhat edgy feel. <\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/i_heart_ny_ad.jpg\" alt=\"I Heart New York Ad\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/i_heart_ny_ads_various.jpg\" alt=\"I Heart New York Ads\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Somehow a PDF of the identity guidelines for the campaign has been posted on-line, and unless someone says it shouldn&#8217;t be, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/brand_guidelines_tpa_nov_2008.pdf\">you can see them here [PDF]<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Major props to <a href=\"http:\/\/industry.bnet.com\/advertising\/1000331\/saatchi-charges-17-million-for-i-love-ny-logo-clip-art\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jim Edwards who posted in detail about this<\/a> and has some of the best links about this story.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Thanks to Mr. Frankie L. for the tip.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,64,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/730"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=730"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/730\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=730"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=730"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=730"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
