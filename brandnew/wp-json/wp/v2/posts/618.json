Yesterday, the new company unveiled its new identity, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.interbrand.com\/portfolio_details.asp?portfolio=3102\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">designed by Interbrand<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>&#8220;The dynamic new corporate identity is a marked departure from the historical look and feel of the two companies and represents Thomson Reuters positioning as the world&#8217;s leading source of intelligent information to businesses and professionals.&#8221;<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/thomsonreuters.com\/content\/press_room\/corp\/corp_news\/212378\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Thomas H.

Unfortunately, those seemingly hundreds of dots make for a rather lousy and mundane icon, better suited as an initial Adobe Illustrator sketch exercise than for a conglomerate &mdash; and their arrangement is pretty unimaginative, there is nothing expressive about them. The wordmark is a little more interesting, it feels unique, composed and contemporary &mdash; although the real star of the identity is the typeface being used on their web site that is almost similar to the one in the logo, I think they can build a lot of recognition through that typeface. Not sure if it&#8217;s off the rack, or custom-made and proprietary, suggestions and clarifications welcome.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/thomsonreuters_reutersmedia.gif\" alt=\"Reuters Logo\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If you visit <a href=\"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reuters.com<\/a>, you&#8217;ll see that that entity still maintains a little more brand hierarchy by using a  Reuters wordmark, picked up from the new logo. A smart move to keep the name recognition of Reuters while extending the identity application. Overall, I like this new work, it is very well suited for its audience and the global business landscape. But I do hate that icon, specially when it gets rendered small, it just looks like the eye of a storm on the local TV news report.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/thomsonreuters_sign_down.jpg\" alt=\"Reuters Sign Takedown\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Reuters sign in Dubai gets stripped down. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2008\/04\/17\/business\/media\/17adco.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Photo by Jumana El Heloueh\/Reuters from nytimes.com<\/a>.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,78,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/618"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=618"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/618\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=618"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=618"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=618"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
