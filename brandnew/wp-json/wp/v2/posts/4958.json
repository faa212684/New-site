The identity by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.toormix.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Toormix<\/a>, revolves, literally, around two circles with some charming typography inside them &#8212; the hero being the one that spells &#8220;BICNIC&#8221; into what could be perceived as a happy face, while the other simply reinforces that it&#8217;s Betlem on wheels. The &#8220;BICNIC&#8221; arrangement is unexpected and oddly appealing. Its thin weight is matched in the applications by a range of minimal patterns representing food that combine really well in the layouts with the two circles. There is an additional sharp, condensed serif in play that feels arbitrary and gratuitous (so it&#8217;s not even acknowledged in the medley image above). Still, while being visually on trend, the balance of pattern patches throughout the applications separates it from other Dribbble-friendly projects. <a href=\"http:\/\/toormix.com\/project\/bicnic\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Southern Kin Cookhouse by Stebbings Partners<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_southernkin.jpg\" alt=\"Southern Kin Cookhouse by Stebbings Partners\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.southernkincookhouse.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Southern Kin Cookhouse<\/a> is a restaurant and bar in Somerville, MA, serving Southern food and mean cocktails. The grunge-light approach by Attleboro Falls, MA-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.stebbings.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Stebbings Partners<\/a> is not novel, particularly not in the restaurant industry, but this stands out as a prime example of the approach done right. The lone rooster icon serves as the anchor for a lovely, mono-thickness script execution of &#8220;Southern&#8221; with &#8220;KIN&#8221; balancing out the curve. What I enjoyed most was the different ways in which the logo was reproduced throughout the restaurant in different techniques and materials as well as the overall vibe of the restaurant itself. (As I write this I am sitting at the Austin airport with a 4-hour delay on my flight so the thought of an alternate reality where I&#8217;m at Southern Kin Cookhouse is heavily playing in my head and I like how it feels.) <a href=\"http:\/\/stebbings.com\/project\/southern-kin-cookhouse\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Lo\u030dk Hue Hn\u0302g by HOUTH<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_lokhuehng.jpg\" alt=\"Lo\u030dk Hue Hn\u0302g by HOUTH\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/LokHueHng\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lo\u030dk Hue Hn\u0302g<\/a> is a bar and cafe in Taipei, Taiwan and that&#8217;s all I can surmise from my limited Chinese. Where I&#8217;m limited by language, my eyes don&#8217;t deceive me. I&#8217;m sure there is a meaning to all the different elements that make up the logo but even if there isn&#8217;t, it&#8217;s a beautiful thing to look at as designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.houth.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">HOUTH<\/a>. The gold on orange color combo is really nice and the layouts all have an off-kilter airiness to them that just adds to the mystique. The corner dingbats on the business card seal the deal for me. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/36118353\/-lok-hue-hng\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"This week we have a range of very different restaurants with strongly differing aesthetics with work from Barcelona, Attleboro Falls, and Taipei&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[564],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4958"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4958"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4958\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4958"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4958"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4958"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
