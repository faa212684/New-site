It was probably in Mexico as I haven&#8217;t been to Spain in a long time. I couldn&#8217;t believe that, neither a design firm nor a client would, independently or jointly, collude to unleash such a monster into the visual landscape. But did they do and they plastered it everywhere, from their own advertising to plenty of high-visibility sponsorships and in the time since, it has become easily (too easily) recognizable even as it moved into more of a Play-Doh aesthetic in recent years.<\/p>\n<p>Doubling down on the contour of the &#8220;M&#8221; and the equity built into it, Movistar is moving forward with what is the obvious (if not &#8220;obvious&#8221; at least the only viable) aesthetic direction, which is going flat. The booger-y, cold-day, snot-like shape of the &#8220;M&#8221; still makes me cringe but I am happy to admit that this latest iteration is&#8230; kinda cool. Maybe I&#8217;m alone in disliking the &#8220;M&#8221; but this makes the best of a bad graphic situation and gives a freshness to the logo that it never had. The wordmark remains the same, but it plays a secondary role, especially now that the &#8220;M&#8221; is to Movistar what the swoosh is to Nike.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/movistar_element_curves.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Movistar by Lambie-Nairn\" \/>\n<figcaption>Cropped logo for background curves.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The streamlined logo also serves as a graphic device for layouts by blowing it up and cropping it, leading to some large, smooth curves to play with in different layouts.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/movistar_element_containers.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Movistar by Lambie-Nairn\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/movistar_element_containers_animated.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Movistar by Lambie-Nairn\" \/>\n<figcaption>Identity element: Containers.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/movistar_element_pictograms.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Movistar by Lambie-Nairn\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/movistar_element_pictograms_animated.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Movistar by Lambie-Nairn\" \/>\n<figcaption>Identity element: Pictograms.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/movistar_element_icons.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Movistar by Lambie-Nairn\" \/>\n<figcaption>Identity element: Icons.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/movistar_elements_illustration_animated_01.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Movistar by Lambie-Nairn\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/movistar_elements_illustration_animated_02.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Movistar by Lambie-Nairn\" \/>\n<figcaption>Identity element: Illustrations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Lambie-Nairn has done a great job in equipping Movistar with a rich set of identity elements that allow for the creation of diverse-looking promos and layouts while maintaining a consistent aesthetic that matches the new smoothness of the logo.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/movistar_applications_banners.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Movistar by Lambie-Nairn\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/movistar_applications_banners_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Movistar by Lambie-Nairn\" \/>\n<figcaption>Online banners.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/movistar_applications_banners_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Movistar by Lambie-Nairn\" \/>\n<figcaption>Magazine covers.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/movistar_long_bannery_things.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Movistar by Lambie-Nairn\" \/>\n<figcaption>Long, banner-y things.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/movistar_outdoor_ads_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Movistar by Lambie-Nairn\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/movistar_outdoor_ads_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Movistar by Lambie-Nairn\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/movistar_outdoor_ads_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Movistar by Lambie-Nairn\" \/>\n<figcaption>Outdoor ads.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The applications are colorful, explosive, and even with an apparent lack of grids &#8212; since everything is so curvy &#8212; the layouts all come together cohesively. The one element that I&#8217;m not a fan of is the light sans serif used. I don&#8217;t mind the lightness as if it were a bold font weight I think it might be visual overload but maybe it&#8217;s the techie-ness of it that clashes in an odd way with the \u00fcber friendliness of everything else.
