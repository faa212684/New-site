What is Tru2way? It is an interactive experience with your television unlike anything you have had until now. It will be carried on major cable operators including <a href=\"http:\/\/www.comcast.com\">Comcast<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cox.com\">Cox<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.timewarner.com\/corp\/\">Time Warner Cable<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cablevision.com\/\">Cablevision<\/a>, and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mybrighthouse.com\/corporate.aspx\">Bright House Networks<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><p>The new identity is brilliantly done by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.siegelandgale.com\/\">Seigel+Gale<\/a>. It communicates a fresh, progressive feeling with its rich color (even though it is a gradient it functions well) and bold typography. There is a trend in identity right now to incorporate <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/xerox_the_very_very_very_shiny.php\">rounded type<\/a>. Whether or not it is appropriate in prior identities is debatable but it functions well here. Initially, I did not know how the majority of consumers would accept the &#8220;html code&#8221; feel of the identity. In the end though, I think it speaks <em>technology<\/em> from another point of view to those who are not involved in web design. <\/p>\n<p>More on the mark:<\/p>\n<blockquote>&#8220;Tru2way is the future of interactive television,&#8221; says Alan Siegel, Chairman and CEO of Siegel+Gale. &#8220;This new, industry-standard technology will allow a whole new generation of interconnected media devices, including interactive television needing no cable box. Consumers will be able to vote, order pay-per-view, purchase products, services and music, organize their content, and access a personalized TV guide, all with a click of their remote.&#8221;<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote><em>The Name:<\/em> The name, tru2way, expresses the true, two-way interactivity of this cable technology &mdash; its ability to dramatically increase and deploy an array of exciting, new interactive services for cable consumers. It establishes a common software platform that enables cable companies, content developers, network programmers, consumer electronics companies, and others to extend interactivity to the television set and many other devices.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote><em>The Brand Promise:<\/em> Tru2way promises to streamline how the public chooses, uses, and enjoys television. For enabled TVs, it means the television set is truly plug-and-play &mdash; no setup box, fewer wires, fewer remotes. On top of that, tru2way brings viewers simple two-way, interactive television that lets them see what they want and have more control.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote><em>The Logo:<\/em> The tru2way logo is designed to help bring the brand promise to life. The arrows and name are integrated, giving it a streamlined, directional feel. The gradient color suggests fluidity. The lowercase letterforms are technical and modern. It is compact and legible. It also operates as a stand-alone trademark and technology symbol, signifying the purity of the interactive experience.<\/blockquote>\n<p>Overall, the newness of the identity should last for a long time while bringing strength to the brand. I can foresee this logo evolving into the digital media and becoming highly interactive. It&#8217;s going to be interesting to see what comes of Tru2Way in the upcoming years.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":15,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[78,12,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/586"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/15"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=586"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/586\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=586"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=586"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=586"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
