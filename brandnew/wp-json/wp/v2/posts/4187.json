His new identity by new, local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/forthepeople.agency\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">For the People<\/a> comes with a playful wink in the form of a hybrid of emoticon and monogram. The &#8220;TJP&#8221; form a playful face that hints at Tim&#8217;s specialty in portraits as well as indicating that he might be a nice guy to work with. This is a very hard trick to pull off but it&#8217;s been executed perfectly. As a bonus, For the People created business cards for his personal projects, so he can hand out his freckles business card to freckled people, his Bondi Beards card to bearded dudes at the beach, and his normal one to the rest of us freckle-less and beard-less folk. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/22623423\/Tim-Jones-Photographer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Iron Grill by End of Work<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_irongrill.jpg\" alt=\"Iron Grill by End of Work\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Iron-Grill-Optus-Campus\/1533754746848590\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Iron Grill<\/a> is a burger and wrap joint located inside <a href=\"http:\/\/www.optus.com.au\/about\/careers\/working-at-optus\/workingplaces\/sydney-campus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Optus&#8217; headquarters building<\/a> in Macquarie Park, Australia, with a sizzling identity by Sydney-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.endofwork.com.au\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">End of Work<\/a>. The logo is quite simple with a slab serif sitting nicely and cleanly on the lines of a grill but behind it, all sorts of charcoal, seared goodness is happening. Mega close-ups of seared lines add a great texture and backdrop to all the elements and gets you in the mood for fire-cooked food. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.endofwork.com.au\/projects\/post\/iron-grill-brand-identity-and-environment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Saastamoisen S&auml;&auml;ti&ouml; by Kuudes Kerros<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_saastamoisen.jpg\" alt=\"Saastamoisen S&auml;&auml;ti&ouml; by Kuudes Kerros\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/saastamoisensaatio.fi\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Saastamoisen S&auml;&auml;ti&ouml;<\/a> (Saastamoinen Foundation Art Collection) is a private art collection in Finland with over 2,500 objects that include Finnish paintings from the early 1900s to this day as well as European contemporary art. Without a logo since 1968, Helsinki-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kuudes.fi\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kuudes Kerros<\/a> created not the most readable inaugural logo with some awkward line breaks and questionable space bar action to create a squared-up, mono-spaced wordmark. And it&#8217;s awesome to look at. I particularly like when the logo goes all <em>Inception<\/em>-like and there is big logos surrounding little logos surrounding littler logos. The resulting typographic textures are quite appealing. Perhaps it&#8217;s not the most user-friendly logo or identity but for a semi obscure art collection it can get away with it. <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/23790209\/Saastamoisen-saeaetioe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/strong><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"We have a single-color line-up of projects today with work from Sydney, Sydney, and Helsinki&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[733,737,564],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4187"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4187"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4187\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4187"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4187"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4187"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
