The initiative, which will create more exhibition space and update the infrastructure to support more new media work, hopes to boost museum participation by 50% and help to revitalize the Oakland cultural scene. A new identity was introduced earlier this month.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/omca_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"Oakland Museum of California Logo, Detail\" \/><\/p>\n<p>There is a clear world of difference between these visual identities. The former places the emphasis on the state abbreviation, most certainly stressing the heritage of much of the noteworthy collection &mdash;\ufffdincluding items like gold-rush era Levi&#8217;s, Greatful Dead posters and Native American baskets. The idea of the new logo is strong but the execution feels like it was forced through a 1990s Microsoft Office product. The new identity shifts the identity away from being heavily california-handed, likely to shake off some of its cal-centirc reputation, and plays its acronym notes by drawing out &#8220;OMCA&#8221;.
