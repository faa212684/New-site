The identity by Brooklyn, NY-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.abrahamlule.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Abraham Lule<\/a>, features a great logo made up of a combination of a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=mexican+cut-paper&#038;lr=&#038;safe=active&#038;source=lnms&#038;tbm=isch&#038;sa=X&#038;ved=2ahUKEwjW5IrskcLmAhUCCM0KHRf6DgIQ_AUoAnoECA0QBA&#038;biw=1578&#038;bih=727\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mexican-cut-paper-like<\/a> illustration of a bird and an elegant but rugged stencil flared sans serif concoction that&#8217;s quite interesting. Reproduced in copper in as many places as possible on black surfaces, the identity has an elegant earthiness to it that is pretty enticing but then again, they already had me at &#8220;wood-fired dishes on a grill&#8221;. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/72197687\/Carbon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Sunmai by Onion Design Associates<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_sunmai.jpg\" alt=\"Sunmai by Onion Design Associates\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.sunmai.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sunmai<\/a> is a craft brewery in New Taipei City, Taiwan, combining German and Chinese techniques and sensibilities to create their award-winning beer. The new name, which, if I understand correctly, means &#8220;three wheat&#8221;, is interpreted by local firm <a href=\"https:\/\/www.oniondesign.com.tw\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Onion Design Associates<\/a>, through the Chinese hanzi character for &#8220;three&#8221; (\u4e09) and stylized with flared serifs that give it an elegant, confident symbol to use throughout the identity. I wish the wordmark were a little better or more interesting than a rich man&#8217;s Copperplate Gothic but I guess it&#8217;s not too bad. I love how they use the icon in the bottles by making it extra large and interact with more contemporary and eclectic illustrations. This isn&#8217;t a big, runaway hit but that icon has so much body to it&#8230; like a good beer. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/54206023\/Sunmai-Craft-Beer-Rebranding\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Folks, Social Burger Club by Guud Studio<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_folksburger.jpg\" alt=\"Folks, Social Burger Club by Guud Studio\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/folks_burgers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Folks, Social Burger Club<\/a> is burger joint in Barcelona, Spain, with a small location and a selective menu of only six burgers &#8212; based on the photos, they nail those six burgers. The identity, designed by local firm <a href=\"https:\/\/www.guudstudio.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Guud Studio<\/a>, is a funky combination of an elegant Didone for the &#8220;folks&#8221; wordmark and a brushstroke font for pretty much everything else. To be honest, I&#8217;m not sure it works but, also to be honest, I don&#8217;t think it matters because the highlight of this project is a series of illustrations where everything from an avocado to a pencil to a music note is given little hands and feet for no evident reason. So, come for the burgers, stay for the weirdness. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/83658519\/Folks-Burgers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"A healthy range of restaurant identities this week, with work from Brooklyn, Taipei, and Barcelona&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,85,26],"tags":[294,790,564,1658],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8309"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=8309"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8309\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=8309"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=8309"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=8309"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
