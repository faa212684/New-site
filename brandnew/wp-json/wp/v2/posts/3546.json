TNT operated the Dutch national postal service under the name TNT Post. The group also offered postal services in eight other European countries, including the UK, Germany, Italy and Belgium. On 2 August 2010, TNT N.V. announced its intention to split up into two independent companies, an express and a mail company. The UK operation changed its name to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.whistl.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Whistl<\/a>. The name has changed due to the split of TNT Group in 2011 and TNT Express keeping the rights to use the TNT brand. The same process has occurred in PostNL&#8217;s other international markets with Germany rebranding to Postcon and Italy to Nexive.<\/p><!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/whistl_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Whistl by Sutcliffe Reynolds Fitzgerald\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/whistl_whistle.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Whistl by Sutcliffe Reynolds Fitzgerald\" \/>\n<figcaption>Whistle.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/whistl_van.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Whistl by Sutcliffe Reynolds Fitzgerald\" \/>\n<figcaption>Van.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"TNT N.V. was an international express, mail delivery and logistics services company with headquarters in Hoofddorp, Netherlands.
