Although their own description &#8212; read the whole thing at the link &#8212; is kind of nauseous in how self-aware it is, the place does look pretty amazing in that rustic, industrial chic aesthetic.

We&#8217;ve featured the previous two event identities on Friday Likes and this year&#8217;s, as usual, deserves a mention, especially if you like color and double especially if you like split fountain. The identity is best represented by the extra colorful posters that showcase fluorescent and bright colors in some epic printed gradients. The recurring lightning bolt logo adds to the already electrifying color spectrum and the holographic paper name badges are a clever way to extend the rainbow-gradient vibe. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/iscreativestudio.com\/project\/ladfest2017\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Blend Station by Futura<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_blendstation.jpg\" alt=\"Maneki by Studio Beau\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/blendstation.com.mx\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Blend Station<\/a> is a coffee shop in the trendy, groovy neighborhood of La Condesa in Mexico City, where they roast their own coffee in-house.

There is the bitmap font logo, some cat eyes, curvy and abstract illustrations, pastel colors, heavy black-and-white usage, and more. It&#8217;s like they threw everything at the wall to see what would stick and everything did, coming together in what looks like a beautiful, serene, slightly trippy environment where every detail has been considered. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/49266167\/Blend-Station\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Plenty of exuberant work this week, all cosmically unified through the Brand New Conference, with work from one former and two upcoming speakers from Austin, Lima, and Mexico City&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[63,11,73,85,26],"tags":[183,597,540,906,186,1357,633,1299,261],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5534"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=5534"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5534\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=5534"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=5534"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=5534"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
