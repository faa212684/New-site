Unless preceded by the command key, there is no copying and pasting for me. Nonetheless I <em>love<\/em> going into craft stores, there is something pretty incredible about all the collected, individual materials, knickknacks and doo-hickeys arranged in neat bundles or stacks begging to be put together &mdash; and, perhaps, there is no haven more crafty than <a href=\"http:\/\/www.michaels.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Michaels<\/a>. Established in 1973, it grew to sixteen stores by 1984, went public and was operating 500 stores by 1995, became a private company again in 2006, and is now celebrating the opening of its 1,000th store in San Antonio. To mark the milestone and thirty-five years in business Michaels is also introducing a new logo.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote> &#8220;Our new logo and tagline are an outward symbol that signifies how we have listened to our customers,&#8221; said Aitken.  &#8220;She wants to create memories, enjoy and be inspired by her creative activities and spend more meaningful time with her children.  She is looking for a place that pushes her imagination, allows for self-expression and personal enrichment through innovation and new, creative products.  And Michaels is the place Where Creativity Happens.&#8221;<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.michaels.com\/online\/departments\/corporate\/images\/1000th%20Store%20Opening%20National%20Release.doc\">From press release<\/a> [links to Microsoft Word document]<\/blockquote>\n<p>It&#8217;s very interesting that in the press release they refer to their customer as &#8220;she&#8221;&hellip; what about <em>my<\/em> feelings?! But I digress. The old logo, set in an unflattering oblique version of Bookman (which in contrast to a true italic it simply takes the Roman forms and slants them) but saved by the swash initial and terminal to at least have some personality &mdash; I should disclose that I am a fan of Bookman and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/exec\/obidos\/ASIN\/1581809255\/uc-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">we&#8217;ve used it at UC headquarters before<\/a>. It was pretty recognizable, specially as it screamed in those ubiquitous red-lighted letters in strip malls across America, something the new one will have trouble achieving, being that it&#8217;s so dainty and light. I do like the evolution of the logo from a stock typeface to a proprietary hand-lettered logo as it speaks to the task of creating and crafting by hand, but I wonder if it&#8217;s too whimsical or too much like a logo for pasta packaging? Overall, a bold move to change drastically a brand so ingrained with its customers.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Thanks to Julie Pardee for first tip.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,86,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/701"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=701"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/701\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=701"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=701"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=701"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
