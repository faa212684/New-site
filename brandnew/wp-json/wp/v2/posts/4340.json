As soon as I saw the logo designed by the Barcelona office of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wearemucho.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mucho<\/a> I understood what it was, not because I am that smart but because the image of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=miguel+de+cervantes&#038;source=lnms&#038;tbm=isch&#038;sa=X&#038;ved=0ahUKEwiRv8338J7JAhWFNSYKHaP4AS0Q_AUIBygB&#038;biw=1460&#038;bih=866\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cervantes wearing his neck ruff<\/a> is so iconic. The &#8220;C&#8221; monogram is beautifully done and a perfect trigger for the sixteenth\/seventeenth-century times of Cervantes when ruff was a hot thing. Not much in application but the logo alone is worth a spot on Friday Likes. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wearemucho.com\/en\/project\/iv-centenary-of-the-death-of-cervantes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Sword Maclean by Freytag Anderson<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_swordmaclean.jpg\" alt=\"Sword Maclean by Freytag Anderson\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.swordmaclean.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sword Maclean<\/a> is a luxury fashion and lifestyle brand in Scotland &#8220;reviving authentic <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hebrides\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hebridean<\/a> craftsmanship&#8221;.

The blackletter-ish wordmark is beautiful and enigmatic, it feels both sexy and dangerous with its exaggerated curves and drastic cuts. It&#8217;s rare to see a contemporary take on blackletter and this logo offers a new perspective on approach and form. Not much again in application but a lovely wordmark worth celebrating this Friday. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.freytaganderson.com\/work\/swordmaclean\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Odder by Aplauso<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_odder.jpg\" alt=\"Odder by Aplauso\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/weareodder.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Odder<\/a> organizes networking events for young people &mdash; specifically &#8220;odd people in a pessimistic world&#8221; and &#8220;exceptional people in a lost generation&#8221; &mdash; to get together and be odd together in Barcelona. Local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/aplauso.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Aplauso<\/a> created a matching odd identity that plays off of the word &#8220;odd&#8221; as the basis and &#8220;er&#8221; as a kind of nth-degree treatment. Typeset in a monospace font with a fluorescent green is on trend and not necessarily surprising but the additional visual and verbal executions of the core idea are interesting, like Sta<span style=\"font-size:small; vertical-align:super;font-weight:500\">ff<\/span> or weareodder.<span style=\"font-size:small; vertical-align:super;font-weight:500\">com<\/span>. The applications are still a little shy and bare but they do have a youthful vibe that should play well with the lost generation of a pessimistic world. <a href=\"http:\/\/aplauso.co\/odder-branding.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/strong><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Some unusual selections this week with work from Barcelona, Glasgow, and Barcelona again&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[900,580,756],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4340"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4340"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4340\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4340"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4340"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4340"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
