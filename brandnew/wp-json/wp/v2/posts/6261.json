Darling Magazine challenges cultural ideals of beauty and questions its exaggerated importance by using models of all sizes and by becoming the first magazine to not retouch women&#8217;s bodies or skin in photos. Founded by Sarah Dubbeldam in 2012, Darling has acquired a large community of unique, intelligent, and influential women who are looking to continue to collaborate with Darling and other like-minded brands. The Darling brand reaches across 5 verticle market segments incluing Darling Magazine, Darlingmagazine.org, @Darling Social Media, Darling Events, and Darling Studios.&#8221;<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/darling_magazine_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo for Darling Media\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/darling_magazine_icon.png\" alt=\"New Logo for Darling Media\" \/>\n<figcaption>Social media icon.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/darling_mission_statement.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Darling Media\" \/>\n<figcaption>Mission statement.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/darling_magazine_cover_before_after.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Darling Media\" \/>\n<figcaption>Cover, before and after.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/darling_magazine_cover.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Darling Media\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/darling_magazine_cover_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Darling Media\" \/>\n<figcaption>New cover.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"(Est. 2009) &quot;Darling Media is dedicated to exploring the complexities of &apos;the art of being a woman.&apos; Free of shallow or negative messaging, Darling acts as readers&apos; all-in-one psychologist, best friend, career advisor, personal stylist, and travel agent to redefine&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,63,25],"tags":[45,772,1366,196,33],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6261"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=6261"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6261\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=6261"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=6261"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=6261"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
