The Seal, issued by the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.goodhousekeeping.com\/product-testing\/reviews-tests\/about-good-housekeeping-research-institute\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Good Housekeeping Research Institute<\/a> &mdash; a 17,000-square-foot (since 2006 when it moved to the Hearst building) lab and kitchen testing facility with scientists and engineers as its staff &mdash; is given to products that pass their rigorous tests, granting them not just use of the seal, but entry into the its namesake magazine, <em>Good Housekeeping<\/em>, which only takes advertisers whose claims and promises can be corroborated by the Institute. The seal gives consumers a two-year warranty on any approved product and will happily issue refunds if necessary. The Seal was introduced in 1909 and, to celebrate its 100th anniversary, a new version has been released.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/good_housekeeping_today.jpg\" alt=\"Good Housekeeping Seal on Today\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Screen capture from the November 25th <em>Today<\/em> show by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.chinovian.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Chino<\/a>.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote>&#8220;If you&#8217;re not a Baby Boomer or older, you don&#8217;t really know what the seal is because they haven&#8217;t done anything to re-energize its importance,&#8221; said Marshal Cohen, chief analyst of the NPD Group, which specializes in consumer behavior.<br \/>&mdash; Polishing the Good Housekeeping Seal, <a href=http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2006\/11\/20\/business\/media\/20housekeeping.html\" target=\"_blank\">from a November 20, 2006 article in <em>The New York Times<\/em><\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p>So at least this confirms I&#8217;m not crazy or that I am completely oblivious to the things I buy. For clarification: I&#8217;m neither a baby boomer nor older. Also, my purchasing decisions rarely come from <em>Good Housekeeping<\/em>, rather from <em>Wired<\/em>, <em>MacWorld<\/em>, and the Amazon.com and epinion.com customer reviews, so not only am I not a baby boomer or older, but a young geek. I digress. The new Seal is far, far better than the old one which was very Swooshy American and had more of a coupon-ish aesthetic that didn&#8217;t flatter it. The new Seal is very nicely executed, and in its use of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.houseind.com\/index.php?page=showfont&#038;id=615\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">House Industries&#8217; Neutraface<\/a>, it gently pushes the nostalgia buttons of the Good Old American Days when apple pies were put in windowsills to cool. With the wider character shapes and generous letterspacing I do wonder if the legibility of the text is compromised, although the Good Housekeeping name, for those that do know about it, is more than enough. But no doubt, this is a great upgrade and it&#8217;s nice to see some properly executed typography go out to the mass market.<\/p>\n<p>If you are interested in learning more about the Seal, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.goodhousekeeping.com\/product-testing\/history\/good-housekeeping-seal-history\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this is a good article<\/a> and here is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.goodhousekeeping.com\/video\/?maven_playerId=flashtestbig&#038;maven_referralPlaylistId=861d21e0eeddf20dd377385a5ff93867439d82b7&#038;maven_referralObject=937863827\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a quick video overview<\/a>.

And now even I am confused. So, as far as I can tell, the swooshy thing <em>is<\/em> the old logo: if you look at the screen grabs below, the swooshy thing appears in products and ads and there is no way a new logo can get on those so fast; the other telling part is that the swooshy logo is the only one that appears on <a href=\"http:\/\/images.google.com\/images?um=1&#038;hl=en&#038;safe=off&#038;client=safari&#038;rls=en&#038;q=Good+Housekeeping+seal&#038;btnG=Search+Images\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google Image Search<\/a> which, again, if this were the brand new logo it wouldn&#8217;t yet appear in Google; and, finally, the last screen grab shows the new logo with a &#8220;100 years&#8221; text below it. So, yeah, I think we got it right. Happy to correct this if I&#8217;m wrong.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/good_housekeeping_video_01.png\" alt=\"Good Housekeeping Seal, Video Grab\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/good_housekeeping_video_02.png\" alt=\"Good Housekeeping Seal, Video Grab\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/good_housekeeping_video_03.png\" alt=\"Good Housekeeping Seal, Video Grab\" \/><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,51,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/733"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=733"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/733\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=733"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=733"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=733"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
