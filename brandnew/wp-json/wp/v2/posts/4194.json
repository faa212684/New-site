Its goal is to reduce child poverty in the borough by empowering parents through education, providing one-to-one support, offering a handful of practical courses, and mentoring over the course of six months. Earlier this year, The Parent House introduced a new identity designed by the London office of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.brandunion.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brand Union<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>We simplified and opened up the logo in line with the charity&#8217;s pledge to provide open-door support for its parents. Our key element is the frame. Flexible and multiform, it acts like a photo frame to hold treasured memories, whether image or text. It preserves real moments in time, marking pivotal turning points in parents&#8217; lives, and it&#8217;s evocation of the home reflects the familial atmosphere of a charity in which many parents return as members of staff.<\/blockquote><h3>Brand Union provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_parent_house_logo_animated.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for The Parent House by Brand Union\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo animation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Given the, um, less than stellar presence of the old logo &mdash; although the knob on the crossbar of the &#8220;H&#8221; is a glimmer of good intentions &mdash; it would be easy to do anything better and that&#8217;s basically what Brand Union has done: take it easy. The new logo is nice and simple and it has a quick, clear read about what it is. I like that it combines the image of a house with that of a book opening or closing even though they refer to it as a picture frame, which makes the concept a little too sentimental. The typography is fairly bland and even though it&#8217;s technically centered, the arrangement doesn&#8217;t <em>look<\/em> centered.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_parent_house_business_cards.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for The Parent House by Brand Union\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.

Everything feels like a first pass. The business cards could not be any more basic and the icons lack so much consistency &mdash; thick lines! thin lines! thinner lines! &mdash; that they would be better off without. Other than using the same rounded sans serif in every size, there is really nothing bringing this together in an interesting manner. I would assume this was done pro-bono and given the effort Brand Union has made on (also assuming) well-paying gigs like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.brandunion.com\/node\/154\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Absolut Flavors<\/a> that turned out fantastic, this feels pieced together as quickly as possible to free up billable hours. Overall, the work is fine and perfectly functioning, most likely a million times better than the materials The Parent House had before but it could have been a million and one. It&#8217;s that little extra that makes a difference. And that&#8217;s what&#8217;s missing here.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 2000, The Parent House is a charity in Islington, a district in Greater London that is well documented for its levels of poverty and low income houses.
