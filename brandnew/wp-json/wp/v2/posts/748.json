The result is a contemporary M monogram that is divided in five parts to represent the five sectors that compose Greater Montr&eacute;al and, in greater detail: &#8220;With its solid three-point footing, the monogram echoes the population&#8217;s roots and pragmatism. Its stylized and friendly curves reflect the straightforward and warm welcome offered by the region&#8217;s residents. Its modular interior can be easily adapted to display Greater Montr&eacute;al&#8217;s many levels of diversity (geographic, economic, cultural, community, etc.).&#8221; The concept of dividing a logo as a patchwork of colors, textures and images isn&#8217;t anything new and it can apply to any city or corporation in the world, but in this case it is at least very well executed and handsome. The typography is very nice too and the whole program is cohesive and engaging, and it can all be seen at the web site linked aboved.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Thanks to Yotam Hadar for the tip.
