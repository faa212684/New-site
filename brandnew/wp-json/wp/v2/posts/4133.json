Since then, Wolfgang Puck has established three separate entities to manage his many ventures: Wolfgang Puck Fine Dining Group (which manages his more than 25 restaurants), Wolfgang Puck Catering, and Wolfgang Puck Worldwide, Inc. On top of cooking he has written cookbooks, launched products, and appeared on various television shows and movies (mostly as himself). To keep all things looking cohesive, Wolfgang Puck has introduced a new identity designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pearlfisher.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pearlfisher<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>The challenge was to help reposition the brand and re-organize the portfolio so that audiences could feel Chef Puck&#8217;s iconic expertise across all brand expression and experiences. [&hellip;] The new positioning marries Chef Puck&#8217;s characteristic warmth with his iconic culinary credentials. The brand architecture investigated his three key lines of business&#8211;fine dining, catering, and consumer goods&#8211;redefining the full portfolio in a way that is both intuitive and efficient, and like all modern luxury brands, defines the boundaries for exclusivity and inclusivity.<\/blockquote><h3>Pearlfisher press release<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/wolfgang_puck_logo_detail.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Wolfgang Puck by Pearlfisher\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The new Wolfgang Puck identity system reflects Chef Puck&#8217;s impact on the modern culinary world: the core identity, inspired by the blade of a chef&#8217;s knife, incorporates a new WP symbol and unique Wolfgang Puck typestyle. This is reinforced through supporting brand assets, including a WP pattern and a monogram stamp; the latter is used across the portfolio as a quality seal and mark of Chef Puck&#8217;s artistry. A warm and luxurious color system envelops the brand across touch points, capturing Chef Puck&#8217;s gracious hospitality, and the ease of California dining.<\/blockquote><h3>Pearlfisher press release<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/wolfgang_puck_monogram.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Wolfgang Puck by Pearlfisher\" \/>\n<figcaption>Monogram detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/135343534?color=ffffff&#038;title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo animation and system.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/wolfgang_puck_summary_dining.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Wolfgang Puck by Pearlfisher\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/wolfgang_puck_summary_catering.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Wolfgang Puck by Pearlfisher\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/wolfgang_puck_summary_worldwide.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Wolfgang Puck by Pearlfisher\" \/>\n<figcaption>Dining, catering, and worldwide systems.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The opening graphic may not be 100% accurate in what are previous top-level Wolfgang Puck logos but it&#8217;s representative of the slight mess of logos that exist. All of them were decent, ranging from simple sans serif wordmarks and monograms to some that include Wolfgang&#8217;s signature. The new logo could arguably live amongst these other logos as the higher-end or corporate-only logo but it&#8217;s definitely a good thing that it&#8217;s being established as <em>the<\/em> one logo. The logo itself is quite nice, especially the WP monogram &mdash; it&#8217;s smart, elegant, and simple. (Perhaps too elegant for the product line as it makes everything look extra fancy.) The stencil-ish wordmark is alright, I&#8217;m not too crazy about (especially the missing crossbar from the &#8220;A&#8221;) it but it works.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/wolfgang_puck_stationery.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Wolfgang Puck by Pearlfisher\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stationery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/wolfgang_puck_business_cards.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Wolfgang Puck by Pearlfisher\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/wolfgang_puck_name_on_restaurants.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Wolfgang Puck by Pearlfisher\" \/>\n<figcaption>Wordmark with existing restaurant logos.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/wolfgang_puck_bread_wrapper.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Wolfgang Puck by Pearlfisher\" \/>\n<figcaption>Pattern.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/wolfgang_puck_wine.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Wolfgang Puck by Pearlfisher\" \/>\n<figcaption>Wine packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/wolfgang_puck_products.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Wolfgang Puck by Pearlfisher\" \/>\n<figcaption>Product range.
