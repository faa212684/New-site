They were unique to suggest an institution like Chase use an austere, geometric and non-literal symbol as their mark. To help celebrate this momentous anniversary Chermayeff is launching their newest creation, the redesign of the Bank of Taipei brand&mdash;half a century later&mdash;with another four-sided trademark, this time with softer shapes and a softer shade of blue.<\/p><!--more--><p>In their own words:<\/p>\n<blockquote>On the heels of a new international agreement that will allow Taiwan banks to do business in the massive Chinese market, the Bank of Taipei commissioned Chermayeff &amp; Geismar, the firm responsible for designing Chase Bank&#8217;s world renowned folded octagon, to create a visual identity that will facilitate its evolution into an Asian banking powerhouse.<br \/><br \/>The Bank of Taipei came to the firm with many of the same needs Chase had in 1960: the mark had to be iconic and durable so that it will outlast trends in design; leave an imprint on its home city; and weather unforeseeable changes in the banking industry. Having to address business realities that have changed dramatically since Chase came to Chermayeff &amp; Geismar in the &#8217;60s, the firm&#8217;s identity also had to portray the bank as high-tech and high-touch; local and international; Eastern and Western.<\/blockquote>\n<p>The new mark is said to take inspiration from the flower at the center of the Taipei flag. The bloom is meant to elicit a feeling of friendliness while the square serves to imply financial security. <\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bank-of-taipei-lockups.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"574\" height=\"112\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">The logo system has a well-considered approach to bilingual lockups.<\/p>\n<p>The mark, like the Chase octagon before it, is elegant. The drawing is a study in proportion and the curves are clean and sure to be reliably reproduced. Chermayeff runs a tight ship. They also make good use of the hard lines when crafting bilingual lockups. The system, however&#8211;how it&#8217;s used across different touch points and to different audiences&#8211;seems a little dry.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bank-of-taipei-applications.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"574\" height=\"472\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">The system extends the purple tones to retail and credit card surfaces.<\/p>\n<p>When it comes to the time horizon of an identity, Chermayeff &amp; Geismar always take the long view (think enduring marks like Mobil, NBC and PBS) and they&#8217;re proud of that. They tend to favor purity of form and concept above trend and marketing. Identity design (or as they refer to it, trademark design) is described in a very particular way on their web site:<\/p>\n<blockquote>Trademark design challenges us to use all the magic and intelligence at our command, all our skill, knowledge, vision, and ability, in the creation of a single, clear, direct image that will embody the character and aspirations of the organizations that come to us in search of identity.<\/blockquote>\n<p>You won&#8217;t find the word <em>brand<\/em> here. A word that has come into vogue out of a simple necessity: a company&#8217;s identity is now (and has always been) more than a logo. More than a trademark. For Chermayeff, it&#8217;s all about the mark. To be sure, this is a strategy  suited fairly well to a financial institution in an emerging market. Simplicity can connote strength and establishment.<\/p>\n<p>However, submitting solid, conservative work can sometimes be taking the path of least resistance. All eyes are on China, and for that matter, Taiwan, as the next global powerhouse. A noted leader in pulling other nations out of vicious recession. And yet, when I really look at this identity system, it feels even older than (the semicentennial) Chase and the type (caught somewhere between Optima and Eurostile) does not help.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bank-of-taipei-web-icon.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"574\" height=\"107\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">It&#8217;s worth noting that the Chase and Bank of Taipei marks each make for excellent web icons.<\/p>\n<p>Formally speaking, the system is pleasing. The purple used throughout is rich and reassuring and I like how the soft cyan sits so naturally on it. But a mark as simple and unadorned as this one could have used more companions to help express the brand in proprietary and memorable ways. If you look at<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bankoftaipei.com.tw\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> their web site<\/a>, you&#8217;ll notice the web designers desperately grasping at ways to keep things interesting. It is at least partly the brand&#8217;s fault for this disarray of cheesy icons, bursts, glitter and stock imagery that replaces sorely needed brand elements (something as simple as a house display font or the proprietary pattern that Chase has been using recently).<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bank-of-taipei-web-frames.jpg\" width=\"574\" height=\"228\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Rotating frames from the Bank of Taipei&#8217;s home page slideshow.<\/p>\n<p>It really comes down to the invisible line between design and marketing.
