The organisation was founded in 1970 by a group of socially committed industrialists under the leadership of the late JRD Tata and Dr Bharat Ram. PFI addresses population issues within the larger discourse of empowering women and men, so that they are able to take informed decisions related to their fertility, health and well-being. It works with the government, both at the national and state levels, and with NGOs, in the areas of community action for health, urban health, scaling up of successful pilots and social and behaviour change communication. PFI is guided by an eminent governing board and advisory council comprising distinguished persons from civil society, the government and the private sector.&#8221;<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pfi_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Population Foundation of India by Lopez Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pfi_logo_animation.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo animation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video controls controlsList=\"nodownload\" poster=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pfi_identity_introduction.jpg\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pfi_identity_introduction.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Identity introduction.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pfi_various_application.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Population Foundation of India by Lopez Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Various applications.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pfi_pocket_folder.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Population Foundation of India by Lopez Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Pocket folder.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pfi_website_a.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pfi_website.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Population Foundation of India by Lopez Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Website.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pfi_instagram.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Population Foundation of India by Lopez Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Instagram posts.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pfi_advertising_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Population Foundation of India by Lopez Design\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pfi_advertising_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Population Foundation of India by Lopez Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Out of home advertising.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pfi_notebook.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Population Foundation of India by Lopez Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Notebook.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pfi_tote_bag.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Population Foundation of India by Lopez Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Tote bag.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"(Est. 1970) &quot;Population Foundation of India (PFI) is a national NGO, which promotes and advocates for the effective formulation and implementation of gender sensitive population, health and development strategies and policies.
