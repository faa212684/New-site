We inspire research, experimentation and critical thinking that turns ingenious ideas into reality. The institute&#8217;s labs and academic programs encourage out-of-the-box thinking and creative exploration, attracting technology visionaries and virtuosos who reach beyond convention, take risks and innovate. Our synthesis of design and technology amplifies innovation in engineering and the arts. We believe the best way to shape the future is to invent it. We promote rigorous, curiosity-driven investigation in a thriving academic community that is supportive, energetic and playful. A changemaker at the University of Colorado Boulder, ATLAS is proud to offer a full portfolio of interdisciplinary academic programs through the College of Engineering and Applied Science.&#8221;<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/atlas_institute_logo_variations.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for ATLAS by Berger &amp; F\u00f6hr\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/atlas_institute_logo_variations_static.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for ATLAS by Berger &amp; F\u00f6hr\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo variations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/atlas_institute_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for ATLAS by Berger &amp; F\u00f6hr\" \/>\n<figcaption>Large view of one of the logos.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/atlas_institute_logo_As.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for ATLAS by Berger &amp; F\u00f6hr\" \/>\n<figcaption>The 36 &#8220;A&#8221;s.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/atlas_institute_logo_subbrands.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for ATLAS by Berger &amp; F\u00f6hr\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sub-brands.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/atlas_institute_stationery.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for ATLAS by Berger &amp; F\u00f6hr\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stationery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/atlas_institute_ads_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for ATLAS by Berger &amp; F\u00f6hr\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/atlas_institute_ads_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for ATLAS by Berger &amp; F\u00f6hr\" \/>\n<figcaption>Posters.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/atlas_institute_ads_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for ATLAS by Berger &amp; F\u00f6hr\" \/>\n<figcaption>Postcards, maybe.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/atlas_institute_posters_notebook.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for ATLAS by Berger &amp; F\u00f6hr\" \/>\n<figcaption>Posters and notebook.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/atlas_institute_banner.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for ATLAS by Berger &amp; F\u00f6hr\" \/>\n<figcaption>Banner.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/atlas_institute_expo.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for ATLAS by Berger &amp; F\u00f6hr\" \/>\n<figcaption>ATLAS Expo event.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"(Est. 1998) &quot;ATLAS is an interdisciplinary institute for radical creativity and invention.
