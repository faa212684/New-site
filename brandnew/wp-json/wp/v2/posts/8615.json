The charity funds world-class research (over \u00a3500million invested to date), ensures everyone affected has access to the right support at the right time, and campaigns for better treatments and care. At the end of last month, Blood Cancer UK <a href=\"https:\/\/bloodcancer.org.uk\/news\/why-weve-changed-to-blood-cancer-uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">introduced its new name<\/a> and identity designed by London, UK-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pentagram.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pentagram<\/a> partner Marina Willer.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>To connect the different strands and convey both the practical and the emotional elements, Pentagram&#8217;s team proposed the word &#8216;Because&#8217; as a way of referring each activity and each individual back to the same cause. This became a central part of the tone of voice:<br \/><br \/><em>Because we research, we care, we support.<\/em><br \/><br \/><em>Because of Lisa, because of Norah, because of Richard.<\/em><br \/><br \/>The symbol is a hand-drawn letter &#8216;B&#8217;, which stands for Blood Cancer UK. It also connects links with &#8216;Because&#8217; and resembles a love heart&#8211;a simple symbol that embodies passion, conviction and kindness. The typography is friendly and yet scientific to indicate professional rigour and the colour red (already used by the charity), also expresses its passion for this important cause.<br \/><br \/>As well as the logo, Pentagram&#8217;s team created the tone of voice, graphic language, animation and photography style.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.pentagram.com\/work\/blood-cancer-uk\/story\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pentagram project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/blood_cancer_uk_logo_stacked.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Blood Cancer UK by Pentagram\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo, stacked.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/blood_cancer_uk_logo_a.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Blood Cancer UK by Pentagram\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo, horizontal.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/402594808?title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0&#038;autoplay=1&#038;loop=1&#038;autopause=0&#038;background=1&#038;muted=1\" width=\"360\" height=\"203\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo animation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>While the old name had the right intention, I can definitely see how it didn&#8217;t work on behalf of the charity as it wasn&#8217;t clear it was about cancer and while the new name may be 100% prescriptive it is also 100% effective in clarifying what and for whom this charity is. The old logo didn&#8217;t help much either by looking like a pharmaceutical corporation or business magazine &#8212; anything but a charity aiming to help people &#8212; and even with the tagline underneath the dry wordmark, it didn&#8217;t quite inspire a connection. The new logo features &#8212; prominently! &#8212; a lovely, hand-drawn &#8220;B&#8221;-slash-heart that has a warm and genuine effusiveness to it because of its size in relation to the wordmark. While &#8220;B&#8221;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.logodesignlove.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/belfast-logo-2008-b-heart.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">have been turned into hearts before<\/a>, this one is appropriate multiple times over as a &#8220;B&#8221; for &#8220;Blood&#8221;, a &#8220;B&#8221; for &#8220;Because&#8221;, and a &#8220;B&#8221; for &#8220;Beat&#8221; (as in in beat the damn thing). The execution of it is great too, with just the right amount of texture to make it look good at big sizes and the right angle\/tilt\/baseline-shift to make it read like a heart easily. The wordmark, in <a href=\"https:\/\/sharptype.co\/typefaces\/sharp-slab\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sharp Slab<\/a>, looks industrious and hard-working, serving as a great complement and contrast to the more emotion-driven &#8220;B&#8221;.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/blood_cancer_uk_print_ads.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Blood Cancer UK by Pentagram\" \/>\n<figcaption>Print ads.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/blood_cancer_uk_ooh_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Blood Cancer UK by Pentagram\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/blood_cancer_uk_ooh_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Blood Cancer UK by Pentagram\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/blood_cancer_uk_ooh_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Blood Cancer UK by Pentagram\" \/>\n<figcaption>Out of home advertising.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The communication applications are amazingly simple and effective, anchored by a strong and memorable copywriting approach of starting a statement with &#8220;Because&#8221;, which allows for multiple entry points to talk about what the organization does and, more importantly, <em>why<\/em> it does it by including names and portraits of people affected. In application, the &#8220;B&#8221; is used even bigger as a backdrop for the copywriting (which looks great on top of a photograph) and still anchored in the same spot on top of the wordmark that sits at the bottom-left corner.
