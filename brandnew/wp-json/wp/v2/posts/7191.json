Today, Hudson Square is buzzing with the energy of more than 40,000 workers in some 1,000 businesses, complemented by thousands of students, visitors and a growing residential population. In Hudson Square, imagination and technology come together to redefine what it means to be creative. The area we manage is generally bounded by West Houston Street on the north, Canal Street on the south, 6th Avenue on the east, and Greenwich Street on the west. Incorporated as a 501(c)3, not-for-profit organization, our formal name is the Hudson Square District Management Association, but we do business as the Hudson Square BID. The geographic area we manage is a Business Improvement District (BID), one of 75 such areas around the city.&#8221;<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hudson_square_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Hudson Square by Applied\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hudson_square_logo_colors.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Hudson Square by Applied\" \/>\n<figcaption>Color variations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hudson_square_logo_on_map.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Hudson Square by Applied\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo on the map.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hudson_square_various_materials.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Hudson Square by Applied\" \/>\n<figcaption>Various materials.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hudson_square_postcards.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Hudson Square by Applied\" \/>\n<figcaption>Postcards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hudson_square_color_palette_poster.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Hudson Square by Applied\" \/>\n<figcaption>Color palette poster.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hudson_square_report.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Hudson Square by Applied\" \/>\n<figcaption>Report.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hudson_square_trashcans.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Hudson Square by Applied\" \/>\n<figcaption>Trash cans.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hudson_square_totebag.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Hudson Square by Applied\" \/>\n<figcaption>Tote bag.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hudson_square_banner.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Hudson Square by Applied\" \/>\n<figcaption>Banner.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hudson_square_plaza.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Hudson Square by Applied\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hudson_square_charger.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Hudson Square by Applied\" \/>\n<figcaption>Charging station.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"&quot;Since July 2009, the Hudson Square BID has overseen the transformation of Manhattan&apos;s former Printing District into a thriving creative hub.
