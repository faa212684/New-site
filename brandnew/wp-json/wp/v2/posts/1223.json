In 2009, Toys &#8220;R&#8221; Us acquired FAO with the intent of keeping the same magical formula that has made it so attractive over the years. If you ever went to FAO as a kid you know that feeling. It is quite incomparable. As an adult it simply holds nostalgia, which dissipates as soon as you enter the overcrowded, visually and aurally saturated store. In any event, FAO has redesigned its identity and packaging of house products to welcome the 2010 holiday shopping season, and has introduced a new character, Wit.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>Displaying a herald-like color palette of deep red and two shades of silver, the FAO Schwarz logo has been redesigned, while continuing to underscore the brand&#8217;s time-honored reputation for the quality craftsmanship of its toys.  The logo emphasizes &#8220;F.A.O.&#8221; &mdash; the first three initials of the founder of the world-famous retailer, Frederick August Otto Schwarz &mdash; and notes the establishment of the business in 1862.  Integral to the new design is the enchanted character, &#8220;Wit,&#8221; who makes his debut, adding a fairytale element of fun and surprise &mdash; a spirit that is embodied in the experience enjoyed by millions of children each year in the New York City flagship store on Fifth Avenue.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/building-on-its-storied-history-fao-schwarz-embarks-upon-the-next-evolution-of-its-brand-designed-to-create-enchanting-memories-for-a-new-generation-of-kids-104929394.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press Release<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fao_schwarz_logo_alt.jpg\" alt=\"FAO Schwarz\" \/><\/p>\n<p>What is interesting about FAO is that it has changed its logo a few times over the years &mdash; sometimes featuring a rocking horse, others a toy soldier, or a teddy bear, and has used similar, hard-angled serifs &mdash; without really losing much equity. This last redesign turns up the stylistic volume a little more with a serif that has a lot more personality and quirks than the previous one. The &#8220;FAO&#8221; feels a little tight, especially in contrast with the descriptive text underneath which is generously spaced. Not that it&#8217;s wrong, but it just feels like those red dots are about to be squished like cherry tomatoes.<\/p>\n<p>The main attraction, though, is Wit, the harlequin. I like the interpretation with the curly neck piece, but I wonder if the the hat is a little too solid in contrast. Perhaps maintaining the filigree approach throughout would have been interesting. Perhaps not. The face is a little creepy, looks a tad soulless or at least stoned. Overall, as a representation of the fantasy land that FAO is, Wit is a good symbol. The limited applications available, on store graphics and packaging, are timid at best and seem to miss an opportunity to create something more engaging and attractive.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fao-branding-store-exterior-580cs121310.jpg\" width=\"574\" alt=\"FAO Schwarz\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Source for all application above and below: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.walletpop.com\/blog\/photos\/faos-rebranding\/3465298\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">WalletPop<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fao-branding-new-580cs121310.jpg\" width=\"574\" alt=\"FAO Schwarz\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fao-branding-bears-580cs121310.jpg\" width=\"574\" alt=\"FAO Schwarz\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fao-branding-big-piano-580cs121310.jpg\" width=\"574\" alt=\"FAO Schwarz\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.davidhubner.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">David Hubner<\/a> for first tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_101019_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_101019_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_101019_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_101019_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,86,26],"tags":[354,105,115,33],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1223"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1223"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1223\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1223"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1223"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1223"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
