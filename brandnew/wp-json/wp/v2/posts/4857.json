Watching players to understand movement, speed, inertia, impact and agility &#8211; and deconstructed them to create a unique behaviour that we call the &#8216;Field of Play&#8217;. It is an entire graphics motion intent that has its roots firmly on the pitch to create a beautiful, elegant and bold motion system. All of the graphics and titles are influenced by on-the-field movement.<\/blockquote><h3>DixonBaxi provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/178345519?title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Motion theory.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/premier_league_motion_theory.png\" alt=\"New On-air Look for Premier League by DixonBaxi\" \/>\n<figcaption>Motion theory breakdown.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/premier_league_experience.png\" alt=\"New On-air Look for Premier League by DixonBaxi\" \/>\n<figcaption>Building the graphics on the momentum of each game.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>As you will see below, the motion package looks great and exciting, and if you didn&#8217;t know about the inner workings shown above you would still think it looks great and exciting but what makes it that great and that exciting is that the underlying behavior isn&#8217;t gratuitous or mere eye candy but is instead informed by the game it represents and manifested in a non-literal execution. Point being: it has a smart concept.<\/p>\n<blockquote><strong>&#8216;Field of Play&#8217; design language.<\/strong><br \/>The graphic system is the canvas, the playing field and the world that the game statistics play out on. It moves fluidly bringing a complex world of live data including league tables, charts, player profiles, in-match information together as a connected whole. The design is crafted with a balanced use of the vibrant colour palette, refined typography and layouts for the hundreds of elements needed to bring the live experience to life. It underpins the Premier League brand and enhances the game.<\/blockquote><h3>DixonBaxi provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/178519924?title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Main montage and presentation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video controls><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/premier_league_motion_guidelines.mov\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Guidelines.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/premier_league_ingame_graphics_01.jpg\" alt=\"New On-air Look for Premier League by DixonBaxi\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/premier_league_ingame_graphics_02.jpg\" alt=\"New On-air Look for Premier League by DixonBaxi\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/premier_league_ingame_graphics_03.jpg\" alt=\"New On-air Look for Premier League by DixonBaxi\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/premier_league_ingame_graphics_04.jpg\" alt=\"New On-air Look for Premier League by DixonBaxi\" \/>\n<figcaption>In-game graphics.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>There is a great smoothness to all the graphics and the varying speeds at which it moves, effectively depicting the changes in speed and natural acceleration and deceleration as well as the bounce of the ball, which is easy to do in things like show titles or idents or coming-up-next bits but not as easy as in in-game charts, stats, and other live titles. All of these things could be presented with a basic fade or slide-in but instead each little detail has been taken care of and given motion, even if it&#8217;s only for a split of a split second.<\/p>\n<blockquote><strong>Show Titles. Human and powerful.<\/strong><br \/>We created a broader visual and tonal language that adds depth to the brand. The new show titles are powerful and human, building excitement, energy and involving the fans and celebrating players.

In the titles we get some cool graphics that at times feel as if Spotify, SportsCenter, and MTV had a three-way baby with a penchant for editorial design. That&#8217;s a good thing. The one element that stands out strangely for me is the use of the wider, bolder styles of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.typography.com\/fonts\/knockout\/styles\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Knockout<\/a> that, as cool as those Heavyweight and Sumo styles are, look out of place against the other condensed title styles and the main sans serif used throughout.<\/p>\n<p class=\"end\">Overall, the on-air package feels very natural&#8230; like, even without knowing what it would look like six months ago when we first saw the logo, this is the appropriate follow-up to it, fitting with the new energy infused in the logo and the expectations of what a modern-day on-air package for a sports entity should behave like. That&#8217;s not to say that work is &#8220;expected&#8221; but rather it being on point.
