Literally. Designed by Melbourne, Australia-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.studiojane.com.au\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Studio Jane<\/a>, the logo transforms from a smiling, winking heart to a pair of hairy testicles to a pair of non-hairy breasts. It&#8217;s charming and smart and it doesn&#8217;t tiptoe around the issue: you have to care for your balls and boobs. A big round of applause to the client for adopting a solution that few other clients would take. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/Wendy-Gough-Cancer-Awareness-Foundation\/13030883\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"We go from ornate to minimal and from serious to funny to serious to funny with work from Minneapolis, London, and Melbourne&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[124,53,769,691],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3096"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3096"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3096\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3096"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3096"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3096"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
