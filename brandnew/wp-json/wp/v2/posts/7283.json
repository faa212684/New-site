In 2017, its fundraising efforts generated \u00a3247.7 million that help support the wealth of information they offer and the campaigning they do on behalf of cancer issues and patients. Last week Macmillan introduced a new identity designed by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dragonrouge.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dragon Rouge<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>&#8220;While the charity is well known and has a recognisable brand, we know that not enough people with cancer are aware of all the ways we can support them. Our focus throughout this work has been on increasing Macmillan&#8217;s relevance and ensuring that everyone who needs us can access our support. In turn we hope that more people will be inspired to offer support to Macmillan. Strengthening our brand is an important way for us to make an even bigger difference to everyone living with cancer in the UK.&#8221;<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/marcommnews.com\/macmillan-announces-ambitious-new-brand-strategy-and-identity\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Macmillan press release<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/macmillan_cancer_support_2019_logo_comparison.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Macmillan Cancer Support by Dragon Rouge\" \/>\n<figcaption>Comparison with old logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>In line with the new brand strategy, Macmillan also worked with Dragon Rouge on the brand&#8217;s identity. Whilst strong and iconic, the existing brand identity had grown and adapted over time, and now needed to not only work harder to flex across different audiences, but also stand out further, appeal to a more diverse audience and work more naturally across digital channels. The result was a new design system approach to all parts of the identity, from the masterbrand logo, to colour, photography and graphic assets, being careful in the change to retain the important equities of the existing identity whilst adding freshness, broader relevance, standout and versatility.<\/blockquote><h3>Dragon Rouge provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/macmillan_cancer_support_2019_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Macmillan Cancer Support by Dragon Rouge\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wolffolins.com\/case-studies\/macmillan\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wolff Olins&#8217; redesign of Macmillan<\/a> in 2006 is one of those significant milestones in identity history for its originality, oddity, and, as the years would prove, effectiveness. It&#8217;s a relief to see that that work is not being completely replaced; at least not yet. (10 years from now, it wouldn&#8217;t surprise me.) The new logo maintains the aesthetic of the old and in all of its nearly indistinguishable quirks it makes small improvements that provide a subtle upgrade. It&#8217;s easy to ask &#8220;But, why?&#8221; as they are changes almost no one will notice but I do think this is a stronger rendition of the original intent and an evolution that will ensure the logo will last for another 10 years (or more). Making the initial &#8220;M&#8221; a little more quirky allows it to stand on its own as a monogram &#8212; it might not have the impact of something like Movistar&#8217;s &#8220;M&#8221; but maybe one day.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video controls controlsList=\"nodownload\" poster=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/macmillan_cancer_support_2019_logo_monogram_animation.jpg\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/macmillan_cancer_support_2019_logo_monogram_animation.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Full logo-to-monogram animation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video controls controlsList=\"nodownload\" poster=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/macmillan_cancer_support_2019_logo_heart_animation.jpg\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/macmillan_cancer_support_2019_logo_heart_animation.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Monogram-to-heart animation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video controls controlsList=\"nodownload\" poster=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/macmillan_cancer_support_2019_font.jpg\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/macmillan_cancer_support_2019_font.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Custom font.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The new custom font is a nice evolution as well &#8212; if you analyze the images on the Wolff Olins link above, you&#8217;ll see some cringe-worthy letters in the applications.
