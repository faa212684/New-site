Recently they were purchased by billionaire Richard Desmond and it seems the new management decided that as well as a change of ownership, a change of branding was also in order. Curiously, this is the channel&#8217;s third change of brand mark in the past 10 years &mdash; which even for the constantly refreshing and evolving world of televisual branding, seems a little fast. The last version was notably designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dixonbaxi.com\/14\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dixon Baxi<\/a> and will remain on the air until February 14 when the new logo takes over.<\/p><!--more--><p>Aside from the obvious visual change, the big change with the new mark is a move from simply being &#8220;Five&#8221; to being &#8220;Channel 5&#8221; &mdash; it&#8217;s tempting to judge the merits of this decision based solely upon the logo, but one has to wonder about the strategic considerations. Perhaps they thought that &#8220;Five&#8221; was more confusing or harder to reproduce than simply a numeral 5. Perhaps people confused Five with being a carbonated beverage, whereas Channel 5 is much more clear as a TV brand? Admittedly, both these arguments seem flimsy and almost laughable, but the silliness of the naming change pales in comparison to the issues with the new mark.<\/p>\n<p>Dressed in a hue reminiscent of the fine velour suits preferred by Ron Burgundy, the logo reminds me instantly of that era of 1970s newscasts. This mark would sit perfectly tiled into a repeat pattern behind an anchorman (never a woman) smoking, sipping a scotch and delivering the news of the day, fresh off the newfangled IBM telegram machines. Whereas the previous mark had a contemporary, almost techie edge, this new mark takes a step back, and then another, and then hops in Marty McFly&#8217;s time machine and cranks up the 1.21 gigawatts to&hellip; well you get it. Try as I may it&#8217;s hard to find any redeeming characteristics, but as with any on-air branding, we&#8217;ll have to wait for the animated versions to see how successful the new mark will be.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to Tom Culton for first tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_110211_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_110211_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"574\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":7,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,66,26],"tags":[468,469,309,42,228],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1342"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/7"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1342"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1342\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1342"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1342"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1342"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
