Bluenext conceives, designs, and develops software for accounting, fiscal, and administrative management for accounting and tax businesses. The idea of Bluenext has been in play since 2012 and after slowly introducing brand name to market between 2013 and 15, the company has now adopted the name fully and introduced a new identity designed by London-based <a href=\"http:\/\/dixonbaxi.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DixonBaxi<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>The new logotype is discreet, simple and confident. The two arrows point inwards to reflect focus and direction and are used as part of the design system to frame statements and ideas.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/dixonbaxi.com\/work\/bluenext\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DixonBaxi project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bluenext_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Bluenext by DixonBaxi\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo was bland and forgettable. Not much else to say about it, really. The new logo is simple and contemporary with a geometric wordmark in reflex blue that hits two of the active trends in logo design. It sets itself apart with the rounded spurs on the &#8220;l&#8221; and &#8220;t&#8221; and, obviously, the &#8220;x&#8221; that doubles as a set of framing arrows. The generous letterspacing gives the wordmark a more sophisticated look and the letterforms have a nice rhythm. The arrows hint more at the software aspect of the company than accounting, which isn&#8217;t a good or a bad thing but, perhaps in a bad way, Bluenext could do software for architects and it wouldn&#8217;t make a difference. (I guess if they were a San Francisco start-up this would allow them to pivot at any time.) There is also a small version of the logo (seen in the notebooks image) where it&#8217;s just a &#8220;b&#8221; and &#8220;n&#8221; with two arrows that&#8217;s nice and minimal but the dork in me would love to see that in a square configuration with the same spacing all around.<\/p>\n<blockquote>Numbers are beautiful. They create order from chaos and can provide insight and clarity. The new design system expresses this simplicity with the use of a rarified palette and an underlying grid system that can be remixed to create hundreds of compositions. These tell reductive visual stories that depict Bluenext&#8217;s human, simple and agile approach to technology. From growth to simplification to clarity of information. The system is designed to be flexible, sophisticated with a playful quality.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/dixonbaxi.com\/work\/bluenext\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DixonBaxi project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bluenext_guidelines_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Bluenext by DixonBaxi\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bluenext_guidelines_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Bluenext by DixonBaxi\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bluenext_guidelines_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Bluenext by DixonBaxi\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bluenext_guidelines_04.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Bluenext by DixonBaxi\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sample guideline pages.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bluenext_brochure.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Bluenext by DixonBaxi\" \/>\n<figcaption>Covers\/posters of some kind.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bluenext_brochure_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Bluenext by DixonBaxi\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brochure\/catalog of some kind.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bluenext_notebook.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Bluenext by DixonBaxi\" \/>\n<figcaption>Notebooks of the notebook kind.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">In application, the killer element about the identity is the set of patterns of &#8220;&times;&#8221;s, dots, and lines.

Again, I&#8217;m not sure if this screams ACCOUNTING, Y&#8217;ALL! but it&#8217;s definitely more appealing than Quickbooks.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 2015, Bluenext is a financial software company based in Italy as the result of a merger between two management software brands, Italstudio (est. 1987) and Sistemidata (est. 1986), both of which will retain their names and brands, with&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,26,44],"tags":[52,292,841,769],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4740"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4740"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4740\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4740"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4740"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4740"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
