A <em>large<\/em> variety.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bounce_big.jpg\" alt=\"Bounce Packaging, Detail\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The old package looked more like its close relative Tide, with the concentric sans serif type and color palette, and it was as unmemorable as most things in the detergent aisle. The new one may not be the package you remember first when you get home and reminisce fondly on your most recent grocery shopping, but it sure goes a long way in giving a small dash of personality to a well-named product. With custom lettering, the new logo that adorns the package is more dynamic and interesting. There are a lot of things that could have been done differently, specially giving it more, well, bounce &mdash; there is too much activity happening in the &#8220;unc&#8221; but not much anywhere else, and the &#8220;e&#8221; feels remarkable tiny. The &#8220;un&#8221; is a fun ligature, and I wonder if it could have all been executed as a script instead, keeping the solid sans structure. <\/p>\n<p>Even the exploding supernova in the background seems acceptable. And the idyllic photo of the fresh white sheets floating in a green field &mdash; those must be some rich people who can afford an acre or two just to hang their clothes to dry &mdash; is so extreme it works. Again, relatively speaking. For a mainstream product like this, this is a nice update that dares to be slightly different. And the family of products (at least in small .jpg form) looks pretty fantastic together.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bounce_family.jpg\" alt=\"Bounce Packaging, All\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.whatisbrutus.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jonathan Lawrence<\/a> for the tip.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,51,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/679"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=679"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/679\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=679"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=679"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=679"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
