Along with football and tango, a juicy steak completes the holy trio of Argentine guidebook clich\u00e9s. But in recent years, something changed. What was initially dismissed as a passing fad, turned into something a lot more serious. Century-old barbecue houses started shutting down and were replaced by trendy restaurants serving tiny portions of mod-food in big white plates. Argentine beef was losing its place of privilege.<br \/><br \/>This was the background when Paty, a historic brand of burgers came to Madre, the Latin American branch of Mother, for a re-launch campaign.<br \/><br \/>Paty is made from 100% premium Argentine beef. It is also the generic name for burgers in Argentina. Which is why, the strategy was to go beyond just talking of burgers, to spearheading the defense of Argentine meat itself. This led to a new strategy- Paty. Argentine Beef.<\/blockquote><h3>Madre Buenos Aires provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/paty_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Paty by Madre Buenos Aires\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>This is a great logo evolution that maintains all the recognizable elements of the original and improves them dramatically. The previous cow was barely recognizable as a cow, the typography was a little too sporty for a frozen-meat product, and the grass swooshes were quite bad even for swoosh standards. The new cow is prouder and stronger, with streamlined lines, the bespoke typography is clearer and better integrated, and the grass swoosh is quite good even for swoosh standards. It drops all the unnecessary gradients and strokes and, more importantly, appears as a properly thought out unit.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/paty_packaging_00.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Paty by Madre Buenos Aires\" \/>\n<figcaption>Packaging, before and after.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/paty_packaging_all.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Paty by Madre Buenos Aires\" \/>\n<figcaption>All styles.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/paty_packaging_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Paty by Madre Buenos Aires\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/paty_packaging_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Paty by Madre Buenos Aires\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/paty_packaging_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Paty by Madre Buenos Aires\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/paty_packaging_04.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Paty by Madre Buenos Aires\" \/>\n<figcaption>Packaging detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The packaging is another undeniable improvement. In the previous design you could replace the picture of the burger with a picture of yogurt and it would work just the same. It was generic and limited the range of things you could do with a patty other than stuff it in a bun. The new packaging puts emphasis on the meat and it&#8217;s always an awesome thing to see seared meat so this excels at that. Another interesting change is that the old box had the Paty logo, small, and then it said again &#8220;Paty [style]&#8221;, which is the general name assigned to patties of any brand and now the logo precedes the style, taking ownership of the &#8220;Paty&#8221; name.<\/p>\n<blockquote>The last part of the strategy was the re-launch campaign. Once the packs were on the shelves, a Television and Outdoor campaign was launched nationwide.<br \/><br \/>The commercial follows the story of Aldo, a contemplative gaucho who after hearing that for the first time ever there are more pizzerias than parrillas (Argentine meat restaurants), decides to take the bull by the horns and heads to downtown Buenos Aires with his herd of cows. He doesn&#8217;t like what he sees, but luckily change is in the air.<\/blockquote><h3>Madre Buenos Aires provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/paty_display_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Paty by Madre Buenos Aires\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/paty_display_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Paty by Madre Buenos Aires\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/paty_display_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Paty by Madre Buenos Aires\" \/>\n<figcaption><strike>Prototype<\/strike> Actual ads, on the street, IRL.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/paty_ads.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Paty by Madre Buenos Aires\" \/>\n<figcaption>Other ad-sy stuff.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/148793104?color=f0001c&#038;title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>TV spot.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">I&#8217;m assuming the print ads are prototypes as, even with a dream client, these are too spare and minimal but, in any case, they are nice.

[Update: the ads for real!] The TV spot is pretty good too, mostly because of the voiceover and the upset gaucho&#8217;s face as he sees what food has come to. Overall, the identity and packaging convey a higher sense of quality that helps elevate the perception of the product (which I am guessing is as good as frozen burger patties can possibly be, so anything that makes them appear more than that is a bonus).<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"First produced in 1960, Paty is a range of frozen, ready-to-cook hamburger patties available in various cuts and is the leading brand in the category in Argentina.
