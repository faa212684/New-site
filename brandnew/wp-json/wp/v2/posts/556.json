Gone are black- and white- checkered tablecloths and the hodge-podge of sports memorabilia that adorned the walls and were reminiscent of Applebee&rsquo;s or TGI Friday&rsquo;s In their place is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rubytuesday.com\/freshlook.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a more upscale and elegant look and feel<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><p>For the most part, I am impressed with the work of <a href=\"http:\/\/pentagram.com\/en\/partners\/dj-stout.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DJ Stout and team from Pentagram, Austin<\/a>. The new identity represents a more sophisticated eating establishment, and features some great brand extensions, such as the &ldquo;RubyTueGo&rdquo; take out service. While the green used on the RubyTueGo cups, billboards and bags are a little garish for my taste, they effectively communicate the idea of freshness. The burgundy, though not much different from the old, is warm and inviting. <\/p>\n<p>RubyTuesday&rsquo;s new logotype is set in Clarendon, a nice, slab typeface that feels somewhat contemporary yet friendly and approachable. Unfortunately, I think that the designers missed the opportunity to add some sort of embellishment to make it more unique&mdash;some minor tweaks could have also resolved the unusual kerning between the T and u of &ldquo;Tuesday.&rdquo; As bad and over-the-top as the old logo was, at least there were decorative touches to the tail of the R and S, as well as the ascender of the D&mdash;these resembled steam, suggesting good things to eat and making it more memorable. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/blog.pentagram.com\/2007\/10\/new-work-ruby-tuesday.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">In reading the Pentagrams&rsquo; blog and the description of the project<\/a>, you would think that they were so proud of themselves for coming up with the idea of merging the restaurant name into one word&hellip; according to DJ Stout, &ldquo;The idea of running the words &lsquo;Ruby&rsquo; and &lsquo;Tuesday&rsquo; together in the logotype came to me one day when I was sitting in the reception area&hellip; waiting for a meeting. I overheard the operators answering the phones and they would routinely refer to the company as &ldquo;RubyTuesday&rsquo; as if it was one word instead of a two word name.&rdquo; <\/p>\n<p>Well, excuse me, but duh! I have always called the restaurant RubyTuesday, not Ruby [pause] Tuesday, or simply &ldquo;Ruby,&rdquo; or even &ldquo;Tuesday&rdquo; for that matter. What is interesting to point out is that on the restaurant&rsquo;s signage (mock up shown on the Pentagram blog), the logotype does not run together to form one word, with Ruby being stacked on top of Tuesday &mdash; so much for the one-word ingenuity. Obviously the new identity has some limitations due to its horizontal nature. <\/p>\n<p>And speaking of signage, you might have noticed in the Fresh Look link from the first paragraph that <em>another<\/em> logo &mdash; not the old foxy one, nor the new one &mdash; adorns the fa&ccedil;ade. Somewhere in between the new and the old, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/4178317829_Ruby_Tuesday_logo.php\" onclick=\"window.open('https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/4178317829_Ruby_Tuesday_logo.php','popup','width=174,height=99,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false\">this logo<\/a> made a brief and confusing appearance online and on TV ads. So, perhaps not the smoothest of transitions for Ruby Tuesday. Overall, there are very few things that I can find fault with in this new Ruby Tuesday identity. Pentagram&rsquo;s &ldquo;simple&rdquo; and &ldquo;fresh&rdquo; perspective has elevated the sophistication of the brand and added a little more &ldquo;snob appeal&rdquo; to a chain known for its casual, affordable menu.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":17,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,69,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/556"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/17"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=556"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/556\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=556"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=556"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=556"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
