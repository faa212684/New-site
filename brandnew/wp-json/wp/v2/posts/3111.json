Her new logo, by fellow Londoners, <a href=\"http:\/\/studioblackburn.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Studio Blackburn<\/a>, is a lovely nod to communication through the use of quote marks &mdash; in the UK, they use single quote marks instead of double quote marks for quotes &mdash; and a clever metaphor for helping fill in the blanks through the missing pieces of the &#8220;M&#8221; and &#8220;W&#8221;. It&#8217;s the kind of logo I would have loved to have done myself. Simple, smart, and with just enough of a puzzle to solve. <a href=\"http:\/\/studioblackburn.com\/our-work\/molly-watson\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Dans Stockholm by Snask<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_dansstockholm.jpg\" alt=\"Dans Stockholm by Snask\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">This past December, <a href=\"http:\/\/dansstockholm.se\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dance Stockholm<\/a> celebrated its first festival of Swedish and international contemporary dance with performances, films, talks, and parties &mdash; and a lot of heart. Designed by the energetic bunch at <a href=\"http:\/\/snask.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Snask<\/a>, the identity starts with a <em>Flashdance<\/em>-flavored logo, a vibrant color palette, and then builds on with some quirk and lighthearted approach to the otherwise serious practice of contemporary dance. Watch out people, the 80s look is coming on stronger and stronger every day. <a href=\"http:\/\/snask.com\/case\/dans\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Easy Tiger by L A N D<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_easytiger.jpg\" alt=\"Easy Tiger by L A N D\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">Since I first heard about <a href=\"http:\/\/www.easytigeraustin.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Easy Tiger<\/a> &mdash; a bakery shop in the East side of Austin, TX &mdash; about a year or more ago, I liked the identity but I hadn&#8217;t found out who designed it until recently, thanks to some good, old-fashioned, internet serendipity. Designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.workbyland.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">L A N D<\/a>, this is one of those non-identity identities that has multiple logos, typefaces, and lock-ups that share minimal consistency or even aesthetic traits among them but when delivered all together they work in perfect unharmonious harmony. If that makes sense. There is also a certain sexy-ugly look to it that somehow makes me want to eat a baguette. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.workbyland.com\/#\/easy-tiger-bake-shop-and-beer-garden\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"This week starts polished and clean and finishes unpolished and dirty with work from London, Stockholm, and Austin&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[230,1025,367,337,1026],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3111"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3111"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3111\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3111"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3111"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3111"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
