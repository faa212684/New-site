Now I&#8217;m not sure if Sam&#8217;s is cheaper or better than Costco or BJs, but I was taught long ago that you can&#8217;t build loyalty on price alone&#8230;unless you really are the cheapest and always will be (like Walmart). If you have a discount store all about price and a competitor opens up shop next door with cheaper prices, say goodbye to your customers. <\/p>\n<p>It seems that Sam&#8217;s is struggling to keep and grow their current customer base and they see an opportunity to bring in fresh consumers with a few more dollars to spend. One way they are attempting to do this is by having a selection of higher priced &#8220;luxury&#8221; items available such as Godiva chocolates or other specialty foods. This, of course, is still in addition to gallon tubs of cheap salsa. Also available are some &#8220;WOW&#8221; items like a Cessna jet. <\/p>\n<p>They have also introduced a new logo and new advertising, which I have not seen. The logo seems to have lost its freshness and retail look in favor of appearing more like a seal of quality. It kind of reminds me of the cotton seal or Teflon seal meant as an endorsement on a hang tag. I&#8217;m curious how it&#8217;ll look as a huge sign on one of their warehouses. My guess is not too good.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Brandnew_SamsClub_Teflon.gif\" src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Brandnew_SamsClub_Teflon.gif\" width=\"470\" height=\"200\" \/><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":14,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,86,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/461"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/14"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=461"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/461\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=461"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=461"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=461"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
