Regardless of what the latter means, local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/madebythebakery.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Bakery<\/a> has created an identity that actually visualizes the philosophical stance of the store with a <em>Blade Runner<\/em>-esque vibe (mostly through how bad-ass-edly this is presented). The extended wordmark, in red, is super hot, typeset in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.myfonts.com\/fonts\/storm\/zeppelin\/53-bold\/?refby=ucllc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Zeppelin (53 to be exact)<\/a>. I wish the &#8220;D&#8221; was a little closer to the &#8220;A&#8221;. The applications are unapologetically black on red or red on black with a bonus formula of a white to red gradient that looks like the sunrise of a dystopian future. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/55293735\/Darkroom\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Mom &amp; Pops Burgers by Mann + K\u00f8ne<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_momandpops.jpg\" alt=\"Mom &amp; Pops Burgers by Mann + K\u00f8ne\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.momandpopschatham.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mom &amp; Pops Burgers<\/a> is a family-owned burger joint with a single location in Cape Cod, MA. Its identity by Portland, ME-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mannandkone.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mann + K\u00f8ne<\/a> features a pair of cows, one for mom and one for pop, wearing sunglasses because who are you to judge what cows can or can&#8217;t wear? The cows&#8217; minimalist line-drawing style extends to other illustrations, like the VW bug and some other burger- and hot dog-inspired depictions (at the project link). The combination of the Woody-Allen-esque serif and the monospace-ish sans in the logo is unexpected but interesting. There is also a big mural that&#8217;s cool on its own (but has nothing to do with the identity) that celebrates the San Francisco roots of &#8220;mom&#8221;. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mannandkone.com\/mom-pops-burgers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Montelena by Anagrama<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_montelena.jpg\" alt=\"Montelena by Anagrama\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Montelena\/1600058850212062\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Montelena<\/a> is an event space in Monterrey that&#8217;s part of chef Alberto Sent\u00edes catering business.
