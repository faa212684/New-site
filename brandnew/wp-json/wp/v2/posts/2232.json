The first two were established in the mid to late 1800s while the latter in 1979, and together they have around 2,000 enrolled students.

At the same text with custom designed logos to complete the look. Sign is ambiguous, such as art. Signal can be seen, for example the starting point and destination, meeting place, location, Signatures, an unknown force, a warning, issue and solution.<br \/><br \/>Art is the nature of the University. We want to be Finland&#8217;s most attractive university and an active social actor. Our new look describes these things<br \/><br \/>The reduced expression leaves room for art and each college&#8217;s own profile for the construction, says the rector of the Academy of Fine Markus Konttinen.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.uniarts.fi\/fi\/ajankohtaista\/uutiset\/taideyliopistolle-ilme\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press release<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/uni_arts_helsinki_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"University of the Arts Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/uni_arts_helsinki_logo_detail_finnish.gif\" alt=\"University of the Arts Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">The new logo in English and Finnish.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/uni_arts_helsinki_logo_animated.gif\" alt=\"University of the Arts Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">The new logo on seizure.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/uni_arts_helsinki_logo_3_small.gif\" alt=\"University of the Arts Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">The logos for each institution.

These new logos, for the main university and its three ducklings, are a bunch of rebellious hooligans out to prove their parents wrong about why they shouldn&#8217;t have become lawyers or doctors. It&#8217;s not an easy set of logos to digest but they are great. They are full of energy and attitude. The execution is pretty &#8220;good&#8221;. It&#8217;s actually really hard to pull off this kind of deconstruction in a convincing way and here they&#8217;ve done it for three different names in two different languages. The &#8220;X&#8221; feels (rather contradicting) both gratuitous, as it doesn&#8217;t visually match the typography, and necessary, as it serves as an anchor of recognition amongst the three universities. I do like the idea of &#8220;X&#8221; as a central point for arts converging but it seems like it needs better integration with the identity. We talk a lot about art and design universities not feeling very creative when they redesign. Well, folks, this is it. This is an art and design university being as creative and bombastic and adventurous and weird as it gets. The result is divisive: you either hate it or you love it. Either way, it beats playing it safe.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/uni_arts_helsinki_tshirt.jpg\" alt=\"University of the Arts Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">T-shirt image via <a href=\"http:\/\/brandingsource.blogspot.com\/2012\/11\/new-logo-university-of-arts-helsinki.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Branding Source<\/a>.
