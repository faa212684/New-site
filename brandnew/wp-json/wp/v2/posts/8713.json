Created by New York-based Daniel Aronhime, who was born in Israel, where sesame seeds are used on a lot of dishes, Seedible sources its sesame from Humera, Ethiopia, and pairs it with dates from Tunisia, pure vanilla from Madagascar, sunflower seeds from Bulgaria, and sea salt from the less exotic Redmond, UT. In preparation for expansion at mass retailers across the country, Seedible recently introduced a new identity designed by Brooklyn, NY-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.misssz.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Miss Sz<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sour-dough.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sourdough<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>As a leading design principle, the brand identity started with something familiar and core to the product itself, taking cues on how seeds scatter. From the wordmark, typography and photography style, the concept of scattered brought a personality to the brand that is unfussy and playful at heart. A play on words of &#8220;Not Nuts&#8221;, not only suggests what the product is (or rather is not), while also establishing a playful brand tone of voice.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.misssz.com\/seedible\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Miss Sz project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/seedible_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Seedible by Miss Sz and Sourdough\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/seedible_logo_alternate.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Seedible by Miss Sz and Sourdough\" \/>\n<figcaption>Alternate composition.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/seedible_logo_social.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Seedible by Miss Sz and Sourdough\" \/>\n<figcaption>Avatar version.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo wasn&#8217;t amazing but it was perfectly acceptable with a curved abstraction of a sesame plant and a matching wordmark in the same curve and thickness, executed proficiently. The new logo loses the sesame plant and introduces a playful logo where the letters drop below the baseline as if they were seeds going into the ground. It&#8217;s perhaps a slightly more challenging interpretation for the consumer than the literal plant with seeds but I think it&#8217;s clear enough to make most people smile about it, especially in the more &#8220;chaotic&#8221; versions. I like how they have maintained emphasis on &#8220;SEED&#8221; by always keeping those four letters together and crumbling the rest. This is a good use of a deadpan sans serif where it&#8217;s infused with some playfulness.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/seedible_tote_business_card_a.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Seedible by Miss Sz and Sourdough\" \/>\n<figcaption>Tote bag and business card.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/seedible_wild_postings.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Seedible by Miss Sz and Sourdough\" \/>\n<figcaption>Wild postings.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>There aren&#8217;t a lot of non-packaging applications and the business-y ones are not the most exciting but maybe they don&#8217;t need to be. A little color could help. The wild postings are much more entertaining with the nut puns &#8212; &#8220;A little crazy but not nuts&#8221; is really good &#8212; in the same crumbly style as the logo.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/seedible_packaging_before_after.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Seedible by Miss Sz and Sourdough\" \/>\n<figcaption>Packaging, before and after.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Like the old logo, the old packaging was perfectly acceptable, although I feel like those nautical-like stripes have been applied to so many artisanal products across all categories that you could build a whole store of them. The new packaging, or well, the new label, is a lot more confident in placing the brand first and product second &#8212; whereas before &#8220;SESAME BUTTER&#8221; was the main focus, it is now &#8220;SEED<br \/>IB<br \/>L<br \/>E&#8221;<br \/>which will help the product gain more brand recognition.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/seedible_packaging_single.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Seedible by Miss Sz and Sourdough\" \/>\n<figcaption>Packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/seedible_packaging_all.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Seedible by Miss Sz and Sourdough\" \/>\n<figcaption>Variations (creamy, crunchy, and chocolate).<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The color variations, in the pastel tones, for the different types of butter could be a little subtle for quick shelf recognition and the typography that specifies the variations may not be obvious enough, which would be my only main criticism as I really enjoy the overall presentation of the product. I don&#8217;t think the packaging is, like, great-great but it has personality and isn&#8217;t afraid of being different, which is emphasized by the hero photography that&#8217;s messy and chaotic and, maybe it&#8217;s because I have kids and dogs, but these are basically scenes from my kitchen counter on a Tuesday and I&#8217;d be okay with licking off all the sesame butter that&#8217;s spilled.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/seedible_packaging_hero.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Seedible by Miss Sz and Sourdough\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/seedible_packaging_hero_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Seedible by Miss Sz and Sourdough\" \/>\n<figcaption>Hero images.
