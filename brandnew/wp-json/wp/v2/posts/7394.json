We&#8217;re a store of firsts: Not only are we the oldest American store of its kind, but we were the first to open a branch location, the first to offer personal shopping, the first to champion emerging designers &#8211;\u00c2 and the first to have a female president. Our legacy is a grounding influence in everything we do. As we move into the future, you will see exciting new services tailored to you, an expanded assortment of colors and sizes, and well-deserved rewards for being a loyal L+T shopper. Shopping with us is now faster, easier and smarter. We&#8217;re always here for you, your family and your community, and look forward to our future together.&#8221;<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lord_taylor_2019_logo_evolution.png\" alt=\"New Logo for Lord + Taylor\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo evolution.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lord_taylor_2019_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo for Lord + Taylor\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lord_taylor_logo_animation.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>New logo introduction.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lord_taylor_2019_monogram.png\" alt=\"New Logo for Lord + Taylor\" \/>\n<figcaption>Monogram.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lord_taylor_2019_monogram_use.png\" alt=\"New Logo for Lord + Taylor\" \/>\n<figcaption>Monogram in use.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lord_taylor_2019_logo_fb.png\" alt=\"New Logo for Lord + Taylor\" \/>\n<figcaption>Lord + Taylor&#8217;s social media team wore out their copy-paste keys with this reply over and over <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/lordandtaylor\/photos\/a.10150101075332892\/10158232172787892\/?type=1&#038;theater\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">on their Facebook profile pic<\/a>.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"&quot;Since 1826, Lord + Taylor has built a reputation for service, quality and style.
