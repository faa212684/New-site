It&#8217;s the result of the merger of Kent Institute of Art &amp; Design and Surrey Institute of Art &amp; Design, University College, both of which were themselves mergers of independent schools and colleges, most of them dating back to the late 1800s. Today, UCA is spread across four campuses in Canterbury, Epsom, Farnham and Rochester, with more than 7,000 students. Earlier this month the university introduced a new identity designed by London-based <a href=\"http:\/\/spin.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Spin<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>It was difficult not to be inspired by the passion for &#8216;creativity&#8217; and &#8216;making.&#8217; Our starting point is a visual language synonymous with designers and architects and employed by them as a way of marking work in progress, the humble stencil. It was from this seed the identity grew. We have created a solid anchor point in the logo whose essential stencil component parts will form the visual root from which the identity grows. Its creative potential has no end and can be developed year on year.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/spin.co.uk\/work\/university-for-the-creative-arts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Spin project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/uca_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for UCA by Spin\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/uca_alternate_logos.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for UCA by Spin\" \/>\n<figcaption>Alternate logos.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The previous logo was as unremarkable as it gets for a creative-oriented institution and the all lowercase approach in the spelling out of the name didn&#8217;t help in any way. (Despite any lack of positive traits, some deluded students <a href=\"http:\/\/www.epsomguardian.co.uk\/news\/11848111.Like_it_or_loathe_it__University_s_new_logo_sparks_student_protest\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">still protested its loss<\/a>). The old logo, you could easily miss but the new one, almost impossible to. The large UCA acronym, rendered with 10 thick lines is big and bold, nicely anchored by the full name of the university, typeset in Lineto&#8217;s Circular, natch. As a standalone logo it&#8217;s nice and sturdy enough but in application it bursts into action with expanded patterns and elements.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/uca_acronym_pattern.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for UCA by Spin\" \/>\n<figcaption>Acronym in different patterns.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/uca_x.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for UCA by Spin\" \/>\n<figcaption>X.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/uca_numerals.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for UCA by Spin\" \/>\n<figcaption>Numerals.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/121228757\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Identity elements in motion.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The patterned acronyms and &#8220;X&#8221;s remind of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=clear+type+rulers&#038;es_sm=91&#038;source=lnms&#038;tbm=isch&#038;sa=X&#038;ei=4LgGVc24KYKeggTisoPoBw&#038;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAg&#038;biw=1741&#038;bih=866#tbm=isch&#038;q=dtp+rulers&#038;imgdii=_\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">old school desktop publishing rulers<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=clear+type+rulers&#038;es_sm=91&#038;source=lnms&#038;tbm=isch&#038;sa=X&#038;ei=4LgGVc24KYKeggTisoPoBw&#038;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAg&#038;biw=1741&#038;bih=866#tbm=isch&#038;q=type+gauge&#038;imgdii=_\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">type gauges<\/a>, with the incrementally spaced and width-varying shapes.
