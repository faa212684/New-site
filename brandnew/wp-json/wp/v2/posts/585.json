Or better yet, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/pressRelease\/idUS156303+14-Jan-2008+PRN20080114\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">in their own words<\/a>: <em>The new programming on Animal Planet will tap into the instincts that drive us all &mdash; fear, hunger, pleasure, nurture &mdash; with compelling stories that resonate with what it means to be human.<\/em> And what better way to unveil this new approach than with &mdash; dun, dun, duuuun &mdash; the fierce <a href=\"http:\/\/animal.discovery.com\/tv\/puppy-bowl\/puppy-bowl.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Puppy Bowl<\/a>! This past Sunday, to coincide with one of the biggest TV-watching days, Animal Planet launched a new identity that goes beyond a simple identity change, as it attempts to shed its family-friendly image for a more intense experience. I was hoping to get some additional imagery for this launch to be able to provide a better picture of the new identity &mdash; and I really wanted to see if this logo had any legs beyond the logo &mdash; yet my efforts went unfulfilled, as some e-mails went unanswered and, to my surprise, there was no rollout of a new identity during Animal Planet&#8217;s programming. So we will have to settle for the logo.<\/p><!--more--><p>The new logo was designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dunningeleyjones.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dunning Eley Jones<\/a>, a London-based design firm with plenty of experience in TV branding, is somewhat confusing. Well, no, make that <em>very<\/em> confusing. The typography feels to be Tobias Frere-Jones&#8217; <a href=\"http:\/\/typography.com\/fonts\/font_overview.php?productLineID=100013\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Knockout<\/a> and its hundred weights, yet there is something oddly uneven about it that makes me think it&#8217;s a knock-off that has been scaled horizontally a tad too strongly. Regardless of what typeface it is or isn&#8217;t, the logo is a weird jumble of ideas. I am guessing that the varying widths of each letter represent the different animals, that the sideways M could be an animal in a different position (I would gander sleeping or ready to fornicate), or maybe it&#8217;s a bat, and that the overall composition is meant to feel alive and unexpected. Unfortunately it feels mechanical, constricted and, well, dead. For an identity that strives to &#8220;bring out the raw, visceral emotion in the animal kingdom&#8221; this simply does not cut it. I could see this identity having a hundred variations where the letters take on different weights, colors and textures, and that could even &#8220;breathe&#8221; on screen with the letters expanding and contracting, yet there is nothing to this logo. Or, at least not yet.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/animal_planet_images.jpg\" alt=\"Jill Greenberg Work\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>[Above] Images from Monkeys &amp; Apes 2 \/ [Below] Image for <em>Dexter<\/em>. &copy; Jill Greenberg<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The one thing that this new launch has going in its favor, is photography by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.manipulator.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jill Greenberg<\/a>, who can add a sense of suspended, realistic surrealism to any character (how&#8217;s that for a description?!). You can see some of those photographs in the video below, and we can only wait until the print campaign hits the streets to see it further in action. I am torn by this approach though: On one hand, I always find that things placed in opposite contexts &mdash; in this case it&#8217;s chimps, lemurs and lions with a studio backdrop &mdash; make for interesting visuals; but on the other I can&#8217;t cope with the urge to humanize animals or, worse, to use them as celebrities with perfect lighting and awesome grooming. But I refrain on further comment until I can see the print campaign AND any sort of motion graphics.<\/p>\n<p><object width=\"425\" height=\"355\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/YuJ64WsKmWc&#038;rel=1\"><\/param><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\"><\/param><embed src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/YuJ64WsKmWc&#038;rel=1\" type=\"application\/x-shockwave-flash\" wmode=\"transparent\" width=\"425\" height=\"355\"><\/embed><\/object><\/p>\n<p>The video above, which I had hoped contained the magic key to this identity, further cements the logo as a static monolith with no life in it.
