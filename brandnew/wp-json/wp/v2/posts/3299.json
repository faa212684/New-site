There is no website yet for CTIL but its identity has been designed by London-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.someoneinlondon.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SomeOne<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>There are many benefits to the layers of the new business, and the partnerships between Vodafone &amp; Telef&oacute;nica&mdash;it was these layers that inspired the new strategic visual brand identity.

Peeling away at the &#8220;C&#8221; in the logo and the rest of the letters in the custom alphabet turns the otherwise expected Gotham into an engaging, surprising sans serif. While I&#8217;m the first to argue against 3D approaches, the logo highly benefits from the exposed view that reveals the layers &mdash; and in the identity below, when the layering effect is used on the different materials, having that slight bit of shading\/gradient in the layers really helps add dimension.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/CTIL_alphabet.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for CTIL by SomeOne\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/CTIL_alphabet_numbers.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for CTIL by SomeOne\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/CTIL_alphabet_sample_words.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for CTIL by SomeOne\" \/>\n<figcaption>Custom alphabet.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/CTIL_stationery.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for CTIL by SomeOne\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stationery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/CTIL_brochure.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for CTIL by SomeOne\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brochures.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/CTIL_summary36.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for CTIL by SomeOne\" \/>\n<figcaption>Various materials.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">In application, the layers remind me of Milton Glaser&#8217;s &#8220;Dylan&#8221; poster but gone corporate. This is both a good and a bad thing. There is just enough flow in those applications to keep the materials lively but the abundant white space and Gotham typography ground it in the seriousness the name of the company calls for. Overall, the layering effect is a winning concept but the applications could have been developed with a bit more sophistication.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"First announced in 2012 as a partnership in the UK between mobile providers Vodafone and Telef&oacute;nica (which runs O2) to develop and share a cellular network to deliver 4G connectivity and compete with the T-Mobile and Orange partnership now known&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[36,12,26],"tags":[314,1059,302,905],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3299"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3299"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3299\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3299"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3299"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3299"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
