Their identity, designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dmowski.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dmowski &amp; Co.<\/a> features a great stencil serif that looks like a lot of trendy stencil serifs but this one is particularly refined. Just look at those &#8220;E&#8221;s. Really beautiful. The accompanying icon is supposed to look like a cake but either I don&#8217;t see it or something got lost in translation because I&#8217;ve seen many cakes and none look like that. Still, it&#8217;s the strength of the wordmark and the simplicity of the applications using a baby blue color accented by gold foil that makes this rise. The matching notch on the business cards to the triangle crossbar in the &#8220;E&#8221;s is a great touch. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dmowski.co\/index#\/odette\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Lotte Avenuel by Mogollon<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_lotteavenuel.jpg\" alt=\"Lotte Avenuel by Mogollon\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.lwt.co.kr\/introduce\/tour\/tour.do?tour_no=13\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lotte Avenuel<\/a> is a luxury mall located in the Lotte World Tower in Seoul. This project is slightly difficult to show both in the composite image above and even in the project page at the link as it&#8217;s not a typical identity but I found it quite intriguing. Designed by New York, NY-based <a href=\"http:\/\/mogollon-ny.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mogollon<\/a>, the identity hinges on a couple of patterns, one of them featuring decorative letters making the word AVENUEL along with some semi-random clip-art pieces and the other a Q*bert-like set of stacked cubes with illustrations. On their own, they are kind of odd but when applied to packaging and even more so to banners it becomes a really strong signaling system. The gold on black\/white gives the patterns a luxurious Baroque feel. Overall, it&#8217;s very unexpected and kind of refreshing to see something so overwrought (in the positive sense of the word). <strong><a href=\"http:\/\/mogollon-ny.com\/new\/index.php?\/fresh\/lotte-avenuel\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Ulju Mountain Film Festival by Studio fnt<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_umff.jpg\" alt=\"Ulju Mountain Film Festival by Studio fnt\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">For the <a href=\"http:\/\/umff.kr\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ulju Mountain Film Festival<\/a> in Ulsan, South Korea, Seoul-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.studiofnt.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Studio fnt<\/a> drew inspiration from one of the more famous <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Irworobongdo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Irworobongdo<\/a> paintings, abstracting the landscape into a minimalist interpretation that then informed the wordmark. Although the wordmark is very reminiscent of the 1968 Mexico Olympics or even the MUNI logo, the relevance to the concept and overall identity supports its use (and makes it <em>not<\/em> a copycat in my eyes). The green, child-like trees and mountains look perfect foil-stamped and the inside of that envelope is pretty classy. Like Lebowski&#8217;s rug that made the room, here it&#8217;s the pink sun that makes the identity for me. It&#8217;s a great spark. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.studiofnt.com\/filter\/identity\/identity-for-Ulju-Mountain-Film-Festival\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a> <span class=\"gray_100\">(<a href=\"http:\/\/bpando.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Via BP&amp;O<\/a>)<\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"From elegant to decadent to minimalist, we&apos;ve got it covered this week with work from Warsaw, New York, and Seoul&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[1065,906,872],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3990"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3990"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3990\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3990"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3990"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3990"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
