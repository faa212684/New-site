This week the UFL unveiled a new shiny logo. I really like the color choice, I think U.S. professional leagues get too enthralled with the red-white-and-blue combo that they forget other colors exist; I like that it&#8217;s the green field and the open skies above, although I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;ll play at night or in closed stadiums. The type is, well, whatever, it&#8217;s footballish. The ball and star icon are a little awkward, and I&#8217;ll leave it up to everyone else to say what it looks like. The overall shape is interesting &mdash; it reminds of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sportslogos.net\/logo.php?id=hvkhsaffs9x9zre7gku4vmnte\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the New Jersey Nets logo<\/a> &mdash; as it avoids pure symmetry, which can sometimes make a logo hard to work with, but it also makes it stand out. I would have loved to see this without the shading and gradients and just the shadow of the ball and star, would have been pretty strong.
