It seemed like the brand was moving on. So, it&#8217;s very surprising that not even with a year and a half in the market Cheer&#8217;s logo and label have changed once again.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cheer_package_02.jpg\" alt=\"Cheers Package, Before and After\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The previous change wasn&#8217;t too drastic, so I&#8217;m certain most consumers didn&#8217;t quite notice, allowing for something more pronounced this time around. If there is one thing that is consistent though is the quirky, yet not quite lovable, typography. The dropped &#8220;e&#8221; adds some dynamism to the mark, but not sure if provides any other function or what it may mean. The bevels, shadows, highlights or whatever those may be are a little awkward, it vibrates, like when you use red on top of green. And the explosion of colors, who knows what it is, but I&#8217;m pretty sure the last thing I want for my detergent is to spew colorful blobs on my clothes. Not much to say about the new label other than it is shaped like a drop, so at least it has that going for it. Overall, it does feel cheerier and lighter.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,51,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/787"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=787"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/787\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=787"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=787"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=787"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
