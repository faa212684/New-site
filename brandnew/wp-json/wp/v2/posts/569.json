Back in very late September, Florida-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.spiritair.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Spirit Airlines<\/a> unveiled a new logo and livery that would replace the current identity that was merely five years old &mdash; one that, in use, happened to look pretty darn nice for a low fare airline [see the prior livery design after the jump]. The new identity &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.spiritair.com\/page.aspx?id=16\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">celebrates the colors of the Caribbean and Latin America regions<\/a>&#8221; and reflects the main routes of the airline, which flies half of its flights (and growing) to destinations in those sunny regions. Besides the new 70s-styled, italicized Helvetica wordmark, Spirit has also introduced a &#8220;stylized&#8221; S [seen on the new livery after the jump] that further emphasizes their Caribbeanness, with each color getting a clever name and association: <em>Caliente Red<\/em>, Low Fares; <em>Palm Tree Green<\/em>, On-time and Reliable; <em>Sunshine Yellow<\/em>, Clean New Planes; <em>Ocean Blue<\/em>, Friendly Staff. So there you have it. The previous identity was purposedly more business like and the planes (from the outside, at least) looked like you were getting more for your money, while the new ones feel like they would not exceed your expectations. At all. The new identity feels like a step back and like it would belong better in the 80s. But, hey, you would be going to the Caribbean, right? Who cares what decade it looks like you are flying in.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/spirit_livery_beforejpg\" alt=\"Spirit Livery Before\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/spirit_livery_after.jpg\" alt=\"Spirit Livery After\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Livery before and after.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.doesyourbusiness.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dave Klonke<\/a> for the tip.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[60,9,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/569"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=569"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/569\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=569"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=569"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=569"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
