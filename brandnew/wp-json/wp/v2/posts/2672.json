For <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theswapshow.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Swap Show<\/a>, &#8220;an exhibition exchange between design studios and creative agencies from cities around the world,&#8221; Singapore-based <a href=\"http:\/\/foreignpolicydesign.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Foreign Policy Design Group<\/a> designed a trendy-in-all-the-right-places identity that exudes swap-iness. The first cross-exhibition will be between studios of Singapore and Barcelona. <a href=\"http:\/\/foreignpolicydesign.com\/v4\/projects\/the-swap-show\/branding\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Karamelleriet by Bessermachen Designstudio<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_karamelleriet.jpg\" alt=\"Karamelleriet by Bessermachen Designstudio\"\/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">For <a href=\"http:\/\/karamelleriet.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Karamelleriet<\/a>, a Danish boutique maker of caramel-based confections, Copenhagen-based <a href=\"http:\/\/bessermachen.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bessermachen Designstudio<\/a> created a delicious line of packaging with such a great color palette that it might actually steal the caramel&#8217;s thunder. The script logo (which is fine but not amazing) is very nicely offset by very straightforward typography and some industrial-strength notches and angled die-cut in the label that give it a nice balance of feminine and masculine, delicate and bold, and ohmygod I want caramel right now. <a href=\"http:\/\/bessermachen.com\/KARAMELLERIET\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Found Objects by Matt Delbridge<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_fo.jpg\" alt=\"Found Objects by Matt Delbridge\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">This is <em>my<\/em> kind of flexibility.
