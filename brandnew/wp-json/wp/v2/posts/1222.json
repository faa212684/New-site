They are held every four years and take place the year prior to the Summer Olympics. The upcoming Games are to take place in Guadalajara, Mexico &mdash; as a native Mexican I apologize, dear world, for the amazingly bad logo for those Games. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.toronto2015.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">In 2015, the Pan American Games go north to Toronto, Canada<\/a>. At the end of September the host city unveiled its identity created by the collaboration of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.endeavourmarketing.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Endeavour Marketing<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/trajectoryco.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Trajectory<\/a>, who beat out nineteen other proposals.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>Nineteen agencies hit the starting line in April with submissions for the upcoming sporting event&#8217;s visual identity, but by the final turn only three submissions made the shortlist: Endeavour\/Trajectory, BBDO Canada and Interbrand.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/trajectoryco.com\/#221013\/News\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Trajectory News<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/panam_games_2015_bid_logo.gif\" alt=\"Pan American Games\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">For reference: Toronto&#8217;s bid logo.<\/p>\n<blockquote>The visual expression of our Games is deeply rooted in Pan American histories, cultures and community traditions as well as the timeless joy of sport. Our identity is inspired by pre-Columbian aboriginal art forms found throughout the Pan Americas including the Mesoamericans who, as early as 1600 BC, used rubber balls in sport and as symbols of the cycle of life. Toronto&#8217;s name likely comes from the Iroquois word &#8220;tkaronto&#8221;, meaning &#8220;place where trees stand in the water.&#8221; The shapes also reflect the city&#8217;s local moniker: &#8220;T.O.&#8221; <br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"\/\/www.toronto2015.org\/assets\/files\/pdf\/PanAm_Spirit.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Viva Panam!<\/em> brochure<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/panam_games_2015_insp.jpg\" alt=\"Pan American Games\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Source of inspiration as shown on <a href=\"\/\/www.toronto2015.org\/assets\/files\/pdf\/PanAm_Spirit.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the Games&#8217; brochure<\/a>.

There is a certain energy to it. But once you to stop to look at what&#8217;s going on, it&#8217;s a bit of a jumbled mess. The &#8220;2015&#8221; numbers on their own are kind of interesting, but when placed within the &#8220;T&#8221; and &#8220;O&#8221; they lose their impact. Speaking of the &#8220;TO,&#8221; I&#8217;m not from Toronto, but I have never heard anyone refer to that city as &#8220;TO&#8221; as the brochure claims. Even conceptually: Why focus on a person kicking a ball, when this is about forty sports, not just soccer? The type choice &mdash; Process Type Foundry&#8217;s Bryant I believe &mdash; enhances the cartoonish look to poor effect; a more serious type selection might have helped offset the goofiness of the logo. The only interesting thing about the identity is when the TO icon gets flipped to represent the Paralympic Games, and the O becomes an abstraction of a wheel chair. And the applications are lively and colorful, so there is that.<\/p>\n<p>And, again, apologies for the Doritos-shaped 2011 logo.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/panam_games_2015_cover.gif\" alt=\"Pan American Games\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><em>Viva Panam!<\/em> brochure cover.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/panam_games_2015_rendering.jpg\" alt=\"Pan American Games\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Rendering of logo application.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to Daniel Safran for first tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_101018_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_101018_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_101018_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_101018_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,26,87],"tags":[150,352,42,353],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1222"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1222"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1222\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1222"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1222"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1222"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
