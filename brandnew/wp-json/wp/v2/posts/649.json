Over the weekend RTVE unveiled a new identity for their corporation as well as a cohesive family of brands for their TV, radio and internet properties.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/rtve_family.gif\" alt=\"RTVE Family, Before and After\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.summa.es\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SUMMA<\/a>, the logos are unified through custom typography and subtle gradients, as well as the slightly beefier &#8220;e&#8221; that stands for Espa&ntilde;a. While in other identities the roundy and gradient choices would have simply been part of this ever growing trend, SUMMA does a good job in rationalizing their execution:<\/p>\n<blockquote>The new corporate identity is based in the concept of light that spreads in all colors of the spectrum. Light symbolizes life, energy, warmth, passion and movement. The goal is to be affectionate and friendly and stablish a strong bond with the audience, but also technological and modern. <\/blockquote>\n<p>Like a moth to the light, I am very attracted to this new identity. There is indeed something very warm and friendly about it, and at the same time feels fresh and rejuvenated &mdash; I would be remiss to say that the overall work does feel like something the offspring of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wolffolins.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wolff Olins<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.siegelgale.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Siegel+Gale<\/a> would have produced&hellip; but that is certainly not a bad thing. The logos are also meant to be in fluid motion, specially the ones for TV, further solidifying the idea of light and energy.<\/p>\n<p><object width=\"425\" height=\"344\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/bpRuEv6Egxs&#038;hl=en\"><\/param><embed src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/bpRuEv6Egxs&#038;hl=en\" type=\"application\/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\"><\/embed><\/object><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Additional applications of the identity.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>As a sidebar, I wanted to point out something that caught my eye in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rtve.es\/FRONT_SALA_PRENSA\/?go=eacaa4148f48af89730076a6669df2169fcb5b71e1aa29da6b3326aee96788b175ba7203410c3374fd8dee2039812aed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">their press release<\/a> &mdash; sorry, it&#8217;s in Spanish &mdash; as an elegant way of describing a rebranding. <\/p>\n<p>In Spanish it states:<br \/>\n<em>No se trata de un cambio de s&iacute;mbolo, sino del s&iacute;mbolo de un cambio.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>In English it translates to:<br \/>\n<em>This is not about the change of a symbol, but about the symbolism of change.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>And I will leave you with that.
