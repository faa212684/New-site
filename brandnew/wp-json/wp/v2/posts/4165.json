Built on the site of a movie theater of the same name that was originally opened in 1946 and closed down in 2012 (for ticket fraud no less), Teatros Luchana offers four stages, each with its own distinct programming from classic to experimental theater and varied seating capacity. Part of the appeal of the theaters is the low, accessible prices made possible through a more frugal approach to the productions. The identity for Teatros Luchana has been designed by Barcelona-based <a href=\"http:\/\/toormix.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Toormix<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>The new identity plays with the unique idea of the 4 spaces and the different type of shows in each one. That&#8217;s why we use the numbers 1, 2, 3 &amp; 4 and a different type for each one. We want to explain the different personality of each room. Every space has its own type for the communication program to easy identify the type with the room number.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/toormix.com\/project\/identity-and-communication-teatros-luchana-madrid\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Toormix project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/teatros_luchana_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Teatros Luchana by Toormix\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/teatros_luchana_stages.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Teatros Luchana by Toormix\" \/>\n<figcaption>The four stage names.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/teatros_luchana_fonts.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Teatros Luchana by Toormix\" \/>\n<figcaption>Typefaces for each stage.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Anchored by Commercial Type&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/commercialtype.com\/typefaces\/dala_floda\/dala_moa\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dala Moa<\/a> the logo is less logo and more of a mini layout that establishes the pieces of the identity system. It places a lot of importance on the four stages and by using four different typefaces it conveys the diversity of the programming. It&#8217;s a simple concept executed quite handsomely. My only complaint is that, although the full alphabets of stages 1 and 4 are very distinct, the actual numbers &#8220;1&#8221; and &#8220;4&#8221; look almost exactly the same and perhaps 3 stands out too much. Being a <a href=\"https:\/\/commercialtype.com\/typefaces\/dala_floda\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dala Floda everything fan<\/a>, I&#8217;m sold pretty much from the start though.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/teatros_luchana_stationery.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Teatros Luchana by Toormix\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stationery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/teatros_luchana_posters.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Teatros Luchana by Toormix\" \/>\n<figcaption>Posters.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/teatros_luchana_programs.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Teatros Luchana by Toormix\" \/>\n<figcaption>Programs.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The identity has a very Spain-esque, modern designer aesthetic, which can be very much like the above: single-color red, strict grid for the layout, funky typefaces. I&#8217;m happy to report it works. In the posters we see yet another use of an angle as a heavy visual element, here stemming from the logo positioned on the top right. It works best on the two posters on the right, where it&#8217;s more subtle.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/teatros_luchana_programs_irl_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Teatros Luchana by Toormix\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/teatros_luchana_programs_irl_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Teatros Luchana by Toormix\" \/>\n<figcaption>Program display.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/teatros_luchana_interiors.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Teatros Luchana by Toormix\" \/>\n<figcaption>Interiors.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">The interiors are great and the big numbers come to literal life in the space while the programs and four stages are broken into neat rows that explain the logo in a dimensional way. Overall, the identity effectively reflects the quirkiness of the theater&#8217;s ambitions and positioning to make it feel different, accessible, and intriguing.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Inaugurated this past May, Teatros Luchana (Luchana Theaters) is a new venue for theater in Madrid, Spain.
