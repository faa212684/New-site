With such a well of talent in that city &mdash; because beyond these typographers there are many designers as well &mdash; you would think that The Hague&#8217;s new marketing identity would reflect a modern, cutting-edge sensibility that catapults it into the 21st century. <em>Not<\/em> the Middle Ages. As is the case with the new logo designed by &#8220;famous pop star photographer, film director and graphic designer&#8221; Anton Corbijn and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.1november.nl\/en-index.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">unveiled back in November 1, 2006 (yes, we are a little late) to much fanfare<\/a>. To briefly explain the logo: The red mark is an outline of the city, the rest&hellip; Who knows, but Corbijn wanted his design to &#8220;express feelings of security, life, progress and playfulness.&#8221; And the stork, the city&#8217;s official symbol, was not required, although I could easily picture flying somewhere in that logo. Which would not be a bad place to start actually: If I were in charge of this project &mdash; something I like to daydream about on all these projects &mdash; I would call UnderWare and say &#8220;Please design a typographic logo for Den Haag with the stork as inspiration&#8221;. Sit back. Wait for an e-mail with an attachment. Throw big party.
