The new logo maintains everything about the original but gives it a much needed trim, thinning the letters and accentuating some of its quirks, like the leafy &#8220;r&#8221; and totally whack &#8220;C&#8221; (which we&#8217;ve come to accept but does not take away from the fact that it is certifiably whack).<\/p>\n<p>There are a few great evolutions in this logo, like the placement of the hop leaf that is now more naturally nestled above the notch of the &#8220;r&#8221; or the way the curve unifies the &#8220;ber&#8221; part, flowing nicely from one letter to the next. The only awkward moment is the connection in the &#8220;ls&#8221; pair which feels very strict and forced in comparison to the rest of the letters but it&#8217;s a small quibble in what&#8217;s otherwise a great evolution that will allow the logo to survive (and thrive) for another 100 years.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video controls loop controlsList=\"nodownload\" poster=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/carlsberg_leaf_evolution_video.jpg\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/carlsberg_leaf_evolution_video.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Hop leaf evolution.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video controls loop controlsList=\"nodownload\" poster=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/carlsberg_signature_evolution_video.jpg\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/carlsberg_signature_evolution_video.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Signature evolution.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The hop leaf and signature evolutions are pretty nice too.

I won&#8217;t spend a lot of time talking about the old one as the bottle might be different to other people but this particular one was nice in its use of the physical bottle to reproduce the logo with a small label in the neck. The new bottle, while crisper-looking because of the logo, feels somewhat cheap with the new label. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s the white stroke or simply the fact that it&#8217;s a generic paper label in contrast to some good, old-fashioned glasswork as in the previous bottle that makes this less premium or interesting. Again, the design looks nice but I think so much work went into the logo that that same attention to detail doesn&#8217;t quite come across here.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/carlsberg_bottle_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Carlsberg by Taxi Studio\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/carlsberg_bottle_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Carlsberg by Taxi Studio\" \/>\n<figcaption>Bottle.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/carlsberg_glass.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Carlsberg by Taxi Studio\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stemmed glass.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>Carlsberg today announced a series of ground-breaking innovations including its new Snap Pack, which is set to reduce plastic waste globally by more than 1200 tonnes a year &#8211; the equivalent to 60 million plastic bags.<br \/><br \/>The Snap Pack replaces the plastic wrapping used around Carlsberg&#8217;s six packs with a pioneering technology that glues its cans together.
