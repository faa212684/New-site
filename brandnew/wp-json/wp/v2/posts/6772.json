The name Phebo, the Greek god of the Sun, was chosen to symbolize the birth of a new era of perfumery in Brazil. Before being incorporated into the Granado Group [ 1 ] in 2004, Perfhearia Phebo was part of the multinational Procter &#038; Gamble and Sara Lee . After the change, their products soon absorbed the culture of &#8216;pharm\u00e1cia&#8217; and began to be formulated with vegetal base . Following a worldwide trend towards a return to value for traditional quality brands, Phebo today appears to its public with a wide range of products: soaps, deodorants, moisturizers, colognes, perfumes, scented candles, environment diffusers and makeup. Currently the Phebo Perfumery accompanies the international expansion of Granado and its products are sold at the Granado store in Paris, France.&#8221; (<a href=\"https:\/\/pt.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Phebo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wikipedia<\/a>)<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/perfumaria_phebo_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo for Parfumaria Phebo by Plau\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/perfumaria_phebo_logo_variations.png\" alt=\"New Logo for Parfumaria Phebo by Plau\" \/>\n<figcaption>With &#8220;established&#8221;.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/perfumaria_phebo_packaging_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Parfumaria Phebo by Plau\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/perfumaria_phebo_packaging_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Parfumaria Phebo by Plau\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/perfumaria_phebo_packaging_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Parfumaria Phebo by Plau\" \/>\n<figcaption>Packaging renders (based on the existing packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/perfumaria_phebo_store_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Parfumaria Phebo by Plau\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/perfumaria_phebo_store_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Parfumaria Phebo by Plau\" \/>\n<figcaption>New store in Rio de Janeiro.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"(Est. 1930) &quot;Perfumaria Phebo is a traditional Brazilian brand, created in 1930 by Mario Santiago and Ant\u00f4nio Louren\u00e7o da Silva, his cousin, in Bel\u00e9m do Par\u00e1.
