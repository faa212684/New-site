With this one, for Colima, Mexico-based <a href=\"http:\/\/cerveceriadecolima.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cervecer&iacute;a de Colima<\/a>, they had me at super-bright-colored bottle caps. Although the project also involves the design of the brewery&#8217;s three beer labels, what I like here is the identity for the brewery itself with its thin script and bright colors. The 12-pack box with the white silkscreen and hipster layout is also pretty attractive but I think my favorite part of the whole thing is the little volcano drawing that can best be seen at the brewery&#8217;s temporary website.
