The unusual approach of each character representing an aspect of the battle or its historical impact results in a logo that asks our audience to make an investment, to spend time and thought in revealing what the identity is saying. Such an immersion is rewarded with depictions of weapons, strategy, terrain, pride and nationhood. The aesthetic of the logo is dark, brutal and spiky, reflecting the realities of battle. Stylistically, the characters reflect contemporary app icons and game graphics, as well as more traditional heritage illustrated visuals.<br \/>&mdash; Brand Book (not available online)<\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/battle_of_bannockburn_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"Battle of Bannockburn Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/battle_of_bannockburn_pins.jpg\" alt=\"Battle of Bannockburn Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/battle_of_bannockburn_poster_01.jpg\" alt=\"Battle of Bannockburn Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/battle_of_bannockburn_poster_02.jpg\" alt=\"Battle of Bannockburn Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<blockquote>Like individual units in an army, each character can be dispatched separately to do battle for the brand through marketing, merchandising and fundraising. The ability to break apart the logo also allows for an identity that can be hacked. We anticipate some sectors of our target audience (particularly students) creating new versions and letters, using images within the letterforms, employing single letters to begin sentences similar to illuminated manuscripts, or even making 3D or animated versions.<br \/>&mdash; Brand Book (not available online)<\/blockquote>\n<p>All captions below are from the brand book.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/battle_of_bannockburn_letter_1b.gif\" alt=\"Battle of Bannockburn Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">The B illustrates the tight packs in which the Scots would group together, known as Schiltrons. The men would brandish pikes ready to spear oncoming troops.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/battle_of_bannockburn_letter_2a.gif\" alt=\"Battle of Bannockburn Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">The A shows the tip of a regular infantry arrow that could be fired by archers to pierce flesh up to 100 yards away.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/battle_of_bannockburn_letter_3n.gif\" alt=\"Battle of Bannockburn Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">This N represents a cavalry horse in its charging position. In total 2700 battle hardened horses were used at Bannockburn.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/battle_of_bannockburn_letter_4n.gif\" alt=\"Battle of Bannockburn Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">This N represents a common medieval chainmail pattern. The chainmail worn could weigh up to three stone.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/battle_of_bannockburn_letter_5o.gif\" alt=\"Battle of Bannockburn Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">The O represents the head of a morning star or mace. This brutal weapon was often used by soldiers on horse back.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/battle_of_bannockburn_letter_6c.gif\" alt=\"Battle of Bannockburn Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">The C represents the sabaton armour that was generally worn by higher ranking infantry. It would protect feet, shoulders and arms from hacking blows.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/battle_of_bannockburn_letter_7k.gif\" alt=\"Battle of Bannockburn Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">The K represents the head of an axe or turn-pike. Robert the Bruce used a battle axe to attack and kill Sir Henry de Bohun &#8211; the axe sliced through his helmet and split his skull in two.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/battle_of_bannockburn_letter_8b.gif\" alt=\"Battle of Bannockburn Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">This B represents the rampant lion that was emblazend on English and Scottish shields and flags. Only after the battle did the lion become associated with the Scottish.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/battle_of_bannockburn_letter_9u.gif\" alt=\"Battle of Bannockburn Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">The U represents the style of helmet used in the battle. Although they limited vision they would protect from stray arrows and light weaponary strikes.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/battle_of_bannockburn_letter_10r.gif\" alt=\"Battle of Bannockburn Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">The R represents a plan of war. The ingenious tactics used by the Scots to defeat the English were crucial to the battle&#8217;s outcome. What was lacked in numbers was made up for in strategic positioning on higher ground.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/battle_of_bannockburn_letter_11n.gif\" alt=\"Battle of Bannockburn Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">The N represents the Declaration of Abroath. As a result of the battle, this important document was created on 6th April 1320 and declares Scotland an independent country.<\/p>\n<p>How to say this in a professional, critical, constructive manner? This logo is fucking awesome. To elaborate, I guess, this is a concept that could have been executed so horribly and so wrong that it would make a <em>Game of Thrones<\/em> betrayal scene look like <em>Nashville<\/em>. The weight and balance of each character and the details within it are all perfectly in tune and there is enough detail to understand the different things each letter is trying to communicate even without the explanations above. Except the first &#8220;N&#8221; &mdash; the horse &mdash; which I had not picked up on and then just blew my mind. The logo is spiky and dangerous and it immediately communicates medieval warfare in a way that is contemporary and exciting. So, yeah, I stand by my initial assessment: fucking awesome.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_130610_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_130610_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_130610_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_130610_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[63,12,26],"tags":[45,108,228,890],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2516"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2516"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2516\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2516"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2516"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2516"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
