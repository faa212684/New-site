Don&#8217;t roll your eyes! It&#8217;s actually relevant. Because the wordmark will mostly live online, we modified Druk so that it would snap to a pixel grid to avoid getting that fuzzy edge effect. The image above is best seen at 100% size by opening it in a new tab\/page. The composite image above is zoomed in at 600% of actual size.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/UC_2015_Update_Wordmark_Sizes.png\" alt=\"New Logos for UnderConsideration done In-house and Mark Caneso\" \/>\n<figcaption>Online, whenever possible, the logo appears at 100%, 200%, or 400% to keep the edges crisp. Obviously, it&#8217;s fine if it&#8217;s used in any size but for the crispest rendering, it&#8217;s all about maintaining the hard edges drawn into the source size.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/UC_2015_Update_Logo_Concept.gif\" alt=\"New Logos for UnderConsideration done In-house and Mark Caneso\" \/>\n<figcaption>Script logo concept: The exact same shape reads as &#8220;UC&#8221; and &#8220;llc&#8221;.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/UC_2015_Update_Logo_Detail_Fill.png\" alt=\"New Logos for UnderConsideration done In-house and Mark Caneso\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/UC_2015_Update_Logo_Detail_Outline.png\" alt=\"New Logos for UnderConsideration done In-house and Mark Caneso\" \/>\n<figcaption>The logo comes in fill and stroke versions.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/UC_2015_Update_Logo_Detail_inline.png\" alt=\"New Logos for UnderConsideration done In-house and Mark Caneso\" \/>\n<figcaption>There is a bonus inline version where the &#8220;llc&#8221; is spelled inside &#8220;UC&#8221;.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/UC_2015_Update_Logo_Pattern_01.png\" alt=\"New Logos for UnderConsideration done In-house and Mark Caneso\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/UC_2015_Update_Logo_Pattern_02.png\" alt=\"New Logos for UnderConsideration done In-house and Mark Caneso\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/UC_2015_Update_Logo_Pattern_03.png\" alt=\"New Logos for UnderConsideration done In-house and Mark Caneso\" \/>\n<figcaption>No idea if we&#8217;ll ever use these patterns but they are fun.
