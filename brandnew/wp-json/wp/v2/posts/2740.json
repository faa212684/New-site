All that, for this?&#8221;. So, you&#8217;ve been warned. This month saw the split of two banks that were originally independent but then merged. The first, Lloyds Bank, was founded in 1765. The second, TSB (Trustee Savings Bank), was founded in 1810. The two merged in 1995 to form Lloyds TSB as a subsidiary of Lloyds Banking Group plc and became one of the &#8220;Big Four&#8221; financial institutions in the UK. In 2009 a ruling by the European Commission demanded that Lloyds Banking Group transfer part of its business to a new owner so, voila, Lloyds Banking Group <em>launched<\/em> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tsb.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TSB<\/a> and <em>revitalized<\/em> the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lloydsbank.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lloyds Bank<\/a> brand. Of the existing branches, TSB will get 631 branches and Lloyds Bank will keep over 1,300. Of the existing customers, around 5 million are being sent to TSB and over 15 million are staying with Lloyds Bank &mdash; this has apparently been the worst part of the transition as many customers aren&#8217;t happy to be shipped to TSB. The new logos for both banks have been designed by London-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rufusleonard.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rufus Leonard<\/a>, which is either the smartest move or the biggest conflict of interests ever. Only insiders know. The launch of the TSB brand was handled by London-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jointlondon.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Joint<\/a> and, I believe, Rufus Leonard handled the Lloyds Bank launch.<\/p><!--more--><p>Each bank has adopted a separate narrative to help distinguish their offerings: TSB is pounding the message that they are &#8220;local&#8221;, meaning that all the money that comes into their bank is being used to fund loans and mortgages to locals and they have no intentions to get into international investments or speculations; meanwhile, Lloyd Bank seems to have grown in confidence with a more &#8220;mature&#8221; tone of voice and messaging &mdash; in the sense of a more serious and life-affirming approach as opposed to saying that TSB is &#8220;juvenile&#8221;. This clearly establishes Lloyds Bank as the bigger, more storied bank that doesn&#8217;t need to make bold claims to get people&#8217;s attention.<\/p>\n<p>Below is a look at the identity and advertising efforts of both banks.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Lloyds Bank<\/h1>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.lloydsbankinggroup.com\/media1\/press_releases\/2013_press_releases\/lbg\/2309_Lloyds_revitalises_brand.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press release of launch<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lloyds_tsb_lloyds_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logos for TSB and Lloyds Bank by Rufus Leonard\" \/>\n<figcaption>Lloyds Bank logo detail.

Keeping the majority of branches while still being able to operate with the horse logo, which has been airbrushed to death making it look like it&#8217;s made out of faux obsidian. The typography, based on the Lloyds Banking Group&#8217;s, has been made friendlier through some small customizations like the angled bars of the &#8220;L&#8221;s, the open arms of the &#8220;Y&#8221;, and the incredibly annoying drooping of the &#8220;A&#8221;&#8216;s crossbar. In application, there isn&#8217;t much of interest other than some nice photography and decent copywriting. The TV spot is quite good.

Executed in a strict palette of blues &mdash; to differentiate from Lloyds Bank&#8217;s green and, certainly, to harken back to its pre-1995 logo &mdash; the identity and advertising are relatively striking. The new logo is far from exciting or overly distinguishing for a financial institution. The big typography in the banners and billboards is almost daring for a bank and it&#8217;s nicely executed &mdash; it certainly demands more attention than Lloyds Bank. Overall, a more interesting case than Lloyds Bank, but still nothing to rattle the bank or graphic industries.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Warning: This is most likely confusing.
