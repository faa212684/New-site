This is the second, more ambitious iteration of Ali Cola &#8212; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.alamy.com\/stock-photo-aydin-umutlu-inventor-of-ali-cola-poses-with-a-bottle-of-ali-cola-54215327.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this is the first<\/a> &#8212; that brings six different &#8220;skin&#8221; colors of the same cola to demonstrate that the exact same thing can be perceived differently because of its color. The design by Hamburg, Germany-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.loved.de\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">loved<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thjnk.de\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">thjnk<\/a> does a fantastic job in creating a striking package that is bound to get the attention of the media for its minimal and blunt design but also serves the concept beautifully by leaving the product (and core message) visible. The minimal typography gets a simple twist by rotating the name on the neck label and making it instantly more interesting than your typical hipster beverage packaging. <a href=\"https:\/\/munchies.vice.com\/de\/articles\/das-ist-die-erste-cola-in-allen-hautfarben\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Here<\/a> are some non-glossy photos, which I was curious about how the product would look IRL. Sales of Ali Cola benefit <a href=\"https:\/\/kiron.ngo\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kiron<\/a>, an NGO that helps provide refugees with higher education. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/48263197\/ALI-COLA-The-cola-in-skin-colors\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a> <\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Helvetimart by Anagrama<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_helvetimart.jpg\" alt=\"Helvetimart by Anagrama\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/helvetimart.ch\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Helvetimart<\/a> is a specialty food market in Lausanne, Switzerland, bringing foods from around the country. Designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/anagrama.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Anagrama<\/a>, the identity references the recurring geometric details found in some of the older houses in Swiss architecture and establishes a growing and adaptable pattern that wraps around boxes, inside envelopes, and looks like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BQBcmyWhLnq\/?taken-by=helvetimart\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">it&#8217;s currently being installed on walls<\/a>. The patterns are punctuated by one of 26 regional flags from Switzerland&#8217;s sovereign states. It&#8217;s a rich, good-looking identity and I&#8217;m glad Anagrama resisted to do a full-on Helvetica justified left identity as not all that is Helvetia should be Helvetica. <a href=\"http:\/\/anagrama.com\/portafolio\/242-helvetimart\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Dig Inn by High Tide<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_diginn.jpg\" alt=\"Dig Inn by High Tide\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.diginn.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dig Inn<\/a> is a regional chain of fast casual eateries with locations in Boston, New York, and Rye Brook. The name is a charming play of words that blends &#8220;dig in&#8221; (for let&#8217;s eat) with &#8220;inn&#8221; (as a place of lodging) and the subtle humor extends to the identity designed by New York, NY-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hightidenyc.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">High Tide<\/a>, i.e., the sugar packet that says &#8220;Sugar Hi!&#8221; (for sugar high). The identity isn&#8217;t the most exciting but it fits the interior aesthetics of the restaurants perfectly and there are some joyous moments like the stacked cups and matchboxes that highlight the lovely color palette and display some playfulness with the name and frame wrapping around the objects. There are a couple of additional graphics &#8212; a rabbit, a sage leaf, and a circle version of the wordmark &#8212; that seem arbitrary but overall, I dig. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/48619529\/Dig-Inn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Another round of minimalism served with a helping of heavier patterns this week, with work from Hamburg, Monterrey, and New York&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[51,69,11,85,26],"tags":[1121,38,564,1089,613],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5210"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=5210"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5210\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=5210"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=5210"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=5210"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
