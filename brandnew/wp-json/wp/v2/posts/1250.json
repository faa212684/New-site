Originally named Kansas City Wiz (no <em>ards<\/em> and featuring <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/File:KansasCityWiz.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a super retro logo at the time<\/a>) the team changed its name in 1997 and last week it announced that it wasn&#8217;t messing with iterations of the word wizard anymore and instead it was changing to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sportingkc.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sporting Kansas City<\/a>. This coincides with the move to a snazzy new stadium in 2011, bringing to an apex the changes ushered by new ownership that began in 2006.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ks_sporting_colors.gif\" alt=\"Kansas City Sporting\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Dimensional version (for online use only) on left; grayscale and 1-color version on right.<\/p>\n<p>The new logo comes with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.insightkc.com\/sportingbrand\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a mini online guide that explains all the different elements of the new crest<\/a>. For example: the &#8220;SC&#8221; ligature stands for Sporting Club and &#8220;[Was] designed to reflect a variety of historical influences within an innovative, contemporary design.&#8221; What kind of historical influences you might ask? &#8220;The rod of the Greek god Asclepius (health and fitness), the Hellenistic statue of Winged Victory (strength and movement) and the Spanish architecture of Kansas City&#8217;s renowned Country Club Plaza.&#8221; The bold lines form &#8220;a shape familiar to all Kansas Citians &mdash; the state line between Missouri and Kansas.&#8221; Not only that but if you count the blue lines and the blank lines, they add up to 11. As in the 11 players that make up a soccer team. Etcetera.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ks_sporting_wordmark.gif\" alt=\"Kansas City Sporting\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Secondary wordmark.<\/p>\n<p>Rationalizations aside, the new logo is a poor interpretation of the familiar crest approach that European Football Clubs &mdash; not <em>Sporting<\/em> Clubs &mdash; use. The elements are too disconnected in style and weight to form a cohesive whole. What bothers me the most is the bounding shape that creates a balloon shape more than a crest giving everything an overly cartoonish look. The best part of the identity is the secondary wordmark, not because it&#8217;s conceptually great but because it&#8217;s at least competently executed and fits perfectly within the angular typography of sports teams. It also reflects the way the name of the team should be said, &#8220;Sporting Kansas City&#8221; whereas the crest reads as &#8220;Kansas City Sporting.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Finally, well, initially, there is also the name. I don&#8217;t mind the loss of the wizards moniker but I question the ease of use in fan parlance of the new name. Before, you could just say &#8220;I&#8217;m going to the Wizards game&#8221; and people would get it. Now, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to the Sporting game&#8221; might eventually make sense but it sounds like Hulk speaking. &#8220;Argh. Sporting game. Fun.&#8221; But I bet if they won another MLS Cup all would be forgiven.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ks_sporting_launch.jpg\" alt=\"Kansas City Sporting\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Logo unveil. <a href=\"http:\/\/sodagraphics.blogspot.com\/2010\/11\/sporting-kc-presser_17.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Images source<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to Jason Buck for first tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_101123_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_101123_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_101123_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_101123_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,26,87],"tags":[292,300,387,208],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1250"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1250"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1250\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1250"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1250"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1250"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
