Now back to our regularly scheduled programming.<\/p>\n<p>Established this year, the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wgsngroup.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">WGSN Group<\/a> is a &#8220;strategic intelligence, insight and trends company&#8221; specializing in the fashion industry by helping &#8220;measure, map and understand the convergence of complex indicators that predict demand, so [customers] can make the right thing, at the right time, at the right speed.&#8221; WGSN Group is comprised of five different products, starting with its flagship, eponymous <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wgsn.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">WGSN<\/a> (Worth Global Style Network) a &#8220;leading fashion forecaster, with over 300 editorial and design staff in offices throughout Europe, Asia, North and South America and the Middle East.&#8221; Its other products include Planet Retail, WGSN INStock, homebuildlife, and Denimhead.

The idea of &#8216;Now. New. Next.&#8217; is expressed in a logo and bespoke typeface with an arrow device to signify forward momentum. But it&#8217;s not all data and maths! It&#8217;s about maths &#038; magic &mdash; the power of data-based judgement and intuition &mdash; so we&#8217;ve added vibrant colours and a fresh visual style that shows the unique balance of the hard and the soft.&#8221;<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/venturethree.com\/work\/project\/wgsn-group\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">venturethree case study<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/WGSN_idea.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for WGSN Group by venturethree\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/WGSN_idea_02.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for WGSN Group by venturethree\" \/>\n<figcaption>WGSN&#8217;s methods.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/73862728?portrait=0&amp;color=ffffff\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Brand film.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/WGSN_brochure_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for WGSN Group by venturethree\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/WGSN_brochure_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for WGSN Group by venturethree\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/WGSN_brochure_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for WGSN Group by venturethree\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/WGSN_brochure_04.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for WGSN Group by venturethree\" \/>\n<figcaption>Corporate brochure.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>While there wasn&#8217;t a before logo for the group we can compare the new one to the previous logo of WSGN with its bold condensed sans serif &mdash; nothing wrong with that &mdash; and its generic globe &mdash; <em>everything<\/em> wrong with that. This is not the first time we see the corner of a &#8220;G&#8221; turned into an arrow but compare to some of the results in this Google Image search for &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=g+arrow+logo&#038;lr=lang_en&#038;tbs=lr:lang_1en&#038;source=lnms&#038;tbm=isch&#038;sa=X&#038;ei=teQ2UoXfNOWC2QXnmYCQDw&#038;ved=0CAcQ_AUoAQ&#038;biw=1453&#038;bih=833&#038;dpr=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">g arrow logo<\/a>&#8221; and you will appreciate that this is one of the nicest executions of that idea. The new wordmark is elegant and bold, much more in tune with the world of fashion and less with the radio station look of the old logo.<\/p>\n<p class=\"end\">Extending the arrow idea from the &#8220;G&#8221; into other letters of the identity&#8217;s typeface provides an interesting way of breaking the monotony of uppercase sans serif and gives WGSN a unique look that borders nicely on being avant garde for the fashion-obsessed clients but also serious enough for the bean-counters. Overall, a solid identity with just the right amount of graphic quirkiness.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"First of all: Many thanks for your patience with us last week and our lack of content &mdash; the Brand New Conference demanded all of our time.
