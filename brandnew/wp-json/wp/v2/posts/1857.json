This week USA Basketball introduced a new logo that replaces the current version, in use since 1989 and made world famous by the original Dream Team at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/usa_basketball_dreamteam1992.jpg\" alt=\"USA Basketball\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">1992 Dream Team. They don&#8217;t make &#8217;em like they used to. Look at that roster (just ignore Laettner).<\/p>\n<blockquote>USA Basketball&#8217;s new logo incorporates the existing USA type into a badge-shaped mark which reflects the honor of playing for the United States of America&#8217;s national team. Also featured is a basketball, a nod to the original Amateur Basketball Association of the United States of America (ABAUSA), and a single star, symbolizing players from all over the country coming together as one team with a common goal.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usabasketball.com\/mens\/2012_new_usabasketball_logo.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press Release<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/usa_basketball_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"USA Basketball\" \/><\/p>\n<p>With so many NBA teams sporting vintage uniforms and logos this season, the old USA Basketball logo doesn&#8217;t seem that much out of place right now, even if it looks as if it could have come straight out of the Julius Erving-1970s-ABA days. But today&#8217;s USA teams look nothing like they used to so a more contemporary logo is a welcome change &mdash; and lo and behold, it doesn&#8217;t entirely suck. It&#8217;s a restrained effort with few elements executed as minimally as possible without gradients and ten different strokes. The &#8220;USA&#8221; block lettering could have used some additional finesse but I really like how the white line that strikes its middle aligns with the top of the shield creating a curve that extends all across. The &#8220;Basketball&#8221; type is simple and decently tracked, considering all the area it has to cover and I mostly appreciate that it doesn&#8217;t have spikey serifs to signify speed and movement. Even the change of the star&#8217;s size, from a main to a supporting element, is remarkably (and relatively) sophisticated. Overall, a definite improvement.<\/p>\n<h1 style=\"margin-top:10px;\">In Related USA Basketball News<\/h1>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/usa_basketball_uniforms_01.jpg\" alt=\"USA Basketball\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Last week Nike also <a href=\"http:\/\/nikeinc.com\/nike-basketball\/news\/basketball-nike-hyper-elite-uniform-and-nike-lunar-hyperdunk-2012#\/inline\/7894\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">unveiled<\/a> its Team USA uniforms, to be used at this year&#8217;s Summer Olympic Games, that showcase their very own &#8220;USA&#8221; logo. The story first broke on Yahoo! Sports with a post titled &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/blogs\/olympics-fourth-place-medal\/nike-team-usa-basketball-logo-hideous-230137256.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nike&#8217;s Team USA basketball logo is hideous<\/a>&#8220;. It&#8217;s not the next IBM logo, for sure, but it&#8217;s far from hideous. It&#8217;s actually a highly energetic and aggressive rendition of &#8220;USA&#8221;. I love how it &#8220;points&#8221; up; a nice allusion to the fact that these people can literally jump over you. The writer mentions that the logo &#8220;has earned derision for looking too angular, too Superman-like and way too ugly.&#8221; I actually like the Superman reference as, again, the athletic abilities of these folks are not quite ordinary. The logo isn&#8217;t perfect and I&#8217;m not sure why I am defending it that much but given the propensity of sports branding to go awry, Nike&#8217;s logo, along with the USA Basketball, show that there is still potential for decent executions.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/usa_basketball_uniforms_02.jpg\" alt=\"USA Basketball\" \/><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_120228_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_120228_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_120228_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_120228_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,26,87],"tags":[215,559,543],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1857"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1857"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1857\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1857"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1857"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1857"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
