Available in over 77 million homes through cable and satellite, Oxygen&#8217;s programming revolves around various original unscripted dramas (aka reality TV) with acquired scripted series and some movies rounding out the schedule. We&#8217;ve covered Oxygen&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/new_logo_for_oxygen_media.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">logo redesign<\/a> and followed up on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/follow-up_oxygen_media_by_eyeball.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">its on-air package<\/a> in 2014. This is a second follow-up on a new on-air look designed by Buenos Aires, Argentina-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.eloisa.tv\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Eloisa<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>Seeking younger millennial viewers who value authenticity in their programming, Oxygen unleashed a fun and lively on-air interface that used a clutter-free design scheme to show off a new raft of unscripted shows geared toward midscale, multicultural women in the 25-34 age range.<br \/><br \/>The only problem was, the brand was so well-designed it proved to be almost too minimal, which is where we came in. Oxygen brought us on to expand the network&#8217;s graphic look into bold, new terrain, to concoct a sparkling refresh of a brand that champions women to be themselves and encourages them to dive into life.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.eloisa.tv\/oxygen\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Eloisa project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/107954440?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=ffffff\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>*2014* on-air package.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Neither the logo nor the on-air package received the warmest of welcomes, the logo in particular got mostly &#8220;Bad&#8221; votes and the on-air elicited mostly &#8220;Fine&#8221; ones. I still find the logo pleasant or, at least, inoffensive but the on-air stuff, in retrospect, was fairly boring. The new system seems like that&#8217;s what Oxygen needed to launch with in 2014&#8230;<\/p>\n<blockquote>In the original Oxygen brand, the most important device was the logo&#8217;s &#8220;connector,&#8221; an underscore beneath the &#8220;O&#8221; that unites copy and graphics in cool and creative ways across the package. We saw a lot of potential in this flexible little bar, especially after we fleshed out its capabilities by incorporating two other parts from the logo into the toolbox: the &#8220;O&#8221; itself&#8221; and the circle inside it.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.eloisa.tv\/oxygen\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Eloisa project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/oxygen_2016_element_shapes.png\" alt=\"New On-air Package for Oxygen by Eloisa\" \/>\n<figcaption>Main shapes.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/oxygen_2016_element_typography.png\" alt=\"New On-air Package for Oxygen by Eloisa\" \/>\n<figcaption>Typography.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The geometric elements of the logo &#8212; namely the &#8220;O&#8221; and its underscore &#8212; are now more evidently a part of the motion work and are injected with some visual steroids to pump up the energy lacking in the 2014 version.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/oxygen_2016_pretty_strong.jpg\" alt=\"New On-air Package for Oxygen by Eloisa\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sample frames from <em>Pretty.

The &#8220;O&#8221;s and underscores combine nicely in different configurations, from tight grids to looser compositions, and the typography follows suit (the example at the 0:08 to 0:10 mark is tight). Some of it is very eye-candy-ish but nothing wrong with a little visual flair just for the joy of it. Overall, this new package captures better the &#8220;young, multicultural women&#8221; vibe without being literal about it and has a proper balance of youthfulness and mainstream appeal-ness of an NBC Universal channel.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Launched in 2000, Oxygen is a TV channel &#8212; or in NBC Universal&apos;s parlance, a &quot;multiplatform entertainment brand&quot; &#8212; targeted to &quot;young, multicultural women&quot;.
