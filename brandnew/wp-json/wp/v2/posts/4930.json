Primary has 70 private offices with more than 100 co-working spaces, it brews Stumptown coffee, and has its own concierge. Needless to say, if the Starbucks with the dirty restroom has been your co-working space so far, upgrading to Primary might require a big payday increase. Currently with one location in New York, they are looking to open a second one in the Flatiron District and another in Toronto, Canada. The identity has been designed by New York, NY-based <a href=\"http:\/\/dia.tv\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DIA<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/182321983?color=7d7d7d&#038;title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo animation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The Primary identity is based on specific color psychology. We developed a generative based platform that creates unique logos depending on desired moods or time of day. The mix of colors help shape the atmosphere of a room, office or specific piece of collateral. Different hues are used for different activities. For example, a Bikram yoga class would involve more heat and intensity than a meditation class, so the colors would vary accordingly. Additionally, each member or employee will be given an individual sphere matching their personality. The identity is a living and breathing experience that can evolve and change.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/dia.tv\/primary\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DIA project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/primary_logo_full.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Primary by DIA\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo. (Please note that the icon and wordmark are meant to work more independently. They are shown here together in this lock-up to quickly show both elements.)<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The logo consists of a very simple, thin wordmark and a color-shifting sphere that give Primary an ambiguous, luxurious, WTF-is-it-anyway? vibe that, no offense, seems to go very well with the affluent customer that would set up office here. Since there are no prices listed on the website, I assume the old adage of &#8220;If you have to ask, you can&#8217;t afford it&#8221; applies here. The sphere is cool to look at, especially when animated, and the different color combinations and texture directions are a nice twist on the usual flexible logo approach but, like the space itself &#8212; or, more likely, <em>because<\/em> of the space itself &#8212; it feels a little pretentious. Like, if you don&#8217;t get it why it&#8217;s a sphere or why Bikram Yoga would require a different color than meditation you are not wellness-aware enough to work or work-out here.<\/p>\n<p>(To pre-emptively beat the it-looks-like comments, the first thing I thought of when I saw this project was &#8220;Oh, good, someone unblurred the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/coopervision_looking_good.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CooperVision<\/a> identity&#8221;.

The different ways (and sizes) in which the sphere is used with the wordmark adds some interesting variety along with, of course, the changing spheres. I have to question whether using the sphere as a logo as well as a bullet point for services or class schedules is the best option as it takes away some of the gravitas of the logo as a logo.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/primary_tote.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Primary by DIA\" \/>\n<figcaption>Tote.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/primary_flag.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Primary by DIA\" \/>\n<figcaption>Flag.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/primary_lobby_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Primary by DIA\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/primary_lobby_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Primary by DIA\" \/>\n<figcaption>Signage.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/182323465?color=7d7d7d&#038;title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Lobby digital sign timelapse.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/primary_calendar_animated.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Primary by DIA\" \/>\n<figcaption>Calendar.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/primary_studio_schedule.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Primary by DIA\" \/>\n<figcaption>Studio schedule display.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">Overall, no doubt this is appropriate and well executed and manages to convey a mix of business and wellness to a specific audience.
