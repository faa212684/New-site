Created from a merger of two existing leagues, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.unitedindoorfootball.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">United Indoor Football<\/a> and (the awesomely named) <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hometeamsonline.com\/teams\/?u=IFLTODAY&#038;s=football&#038;t=c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Intense Football League<\/a>, IFL will bring together the teams from each league for next year&#8217;s season.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ifl_logo_wordmark.gif\" alt=\"IFL Wordmark\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Wordmark sans eagle.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The former logos definitely felt second rate and rather unexciting. The new logo at least conforms to first-rate sports logo standards: Mean animal, beveled typography and strokes, lots of strokes. This, of course, does not make it a good logo and by first-rate standards this one falls at the bottom of the pile. Everything that could be wrongly depicted on the eagle is: Wings are too short, the claws grasping the ball are awkward and, poor eagle, appears to have lost his eyeballs. The lettering is nothing we haven&#8217;t seen before and there is an odd relationship between the width of stems and the height of the serifs that makes it look stretched. The nudges in the top junctions of each letter are kind of cool, but that&#8217;s about it. The football is overly shiny and at an odd perspective, judging from the laces. <\/p>\n<p>So, while it&#8217;s an improvement from the previous logos and a more authoritative look, the result is too standard and not well executed. But at least the eagle won&#8217;t get soaked indoors if it rains.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ifl_logo_blue.gif\" alt=\"IFL Logo Detail\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ifl_logo_bw.gif\" alt=\"IFL Logo Detail\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.oxidedesign.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Drew Davies<\/a> for the tip.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,26,87],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/680"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=680"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/680\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=680"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=680"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=680"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
