Macy. With two locations, Atlantic has produced over 150 plays in 30 years, including multiple Tony Award winners. In August, the theater introduced a new identity designed by New York <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pentagram.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pentagram<\/a> partner Paula Scher.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>For the Atlantic, Scher developed a system that can accommodate a wide range of uses but still unmistakably read as &#8220;the Atlantic.&#8221; The new logo takes the form of an abstract graphic emblem that is inspired by the shape of an &#8220;A&#8221; and also suggests a megaphone or spotlight. The shape can be used as a device to house &mdash; or &#8220;stage&#8221; &mdash; imagery related to a featured play or program, or by itself to represent the company as a whole. The emblem is accompanied by strong typography set in the compact sans serif Tungsten.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.pentagram.com\/#\/blog\/124655\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pentagram project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/atlantic_theater_company_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Atlantic Theater Company by Pentagram\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/atlantic_theater_company_banner.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Atlantic Theater Company by Pentagram\" \/>\n<figcaption>Banner outside theater.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The previous logo had good, edgy intentions with its 3D, photocopy-textured &#8220;A&#8221; and wordmark in a semi-circle but it doesn&#8217;t look particularly helpful in building an identity around it. The new logo takes the two basic premises of the old one &mdash; an oversized &#8220;A&#8221; and condensed typography &mdash; to create something much better. The &#8220;A&#8221; is now abstracted as a trapezoid shape that can be interpreted as a spotlight, a really big megaphone, or, you know, an &#8220;A&#8221;, any of which are perfectly valid and relevant to theater. The logo is bold, striking, and hard to miss. The accompanying wordmark reinforces that the shape is an &#8220;A&#8221; by replacing all &#8220;A&#8221;s with it. Since each of the three words in the name has an &#8220;A&#8221;, the effect works particularly well.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/atlantic_theater_company_stationery.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Atlantic Theater Company by Pentagram\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stationery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/atlantic_theater_company_tote.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Atlantic Theater Company by Pentagram\" \/>\n<figcaption>Tote.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The institutional applications are very straightforward yet bursting with energy as the &#8220;A&#8221; takes up the full size of some of the layouts or, in an alternate application, becomes confetti. Some might not like this deviation but I think it feels particularly joyful.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/atlantic_theater_company_tickets_print.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Atlantic Theater Company by Pentagram\" \/>\n<figcaption>Various materials.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/atlantic_theater_company_brochure.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Atlantic Theater Company by Pentagram\" \/>\n<figcaption>2015 &ndash; 16 season brochure.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The &#8220;A&#8221; gets repeated plenty in all the applications and it might get tiring or repetitive after a while &mdash; repetition begets branding, so maybe it&#8217;s not the worst that could happen &mdash; but, for now, it gets broken up nicely by using one &#8220;A&#8221;, multiple &#8220;A&#8221;s, at angles or straight up, and with blue half-tone photographs in unexpected angles.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/atlantic_theater_company_posters.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Atlantic Theater Company by Pentagram\" \/>\n<figcaption>Posters.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/atlantic_theater_company_poster_real.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Atlantic Theater Company by Pentagram\" \/>\n<figcaption>Poster, for reals.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/atlantic_theater_company_poster_subway.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Atlantic Theater Company by Pentagram\" \/>\n<figcaption>Subway poster.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">The posters are dead simple, intersecting the name of the play with the &#8220;A&#8221;, making every poster a &#8220;touchpoint&#8221; for the theater&#8217;s logo establishing the institution in viewer&#8217;s minds and establishing a connection between the play and the theater. It&#8217;s hard to <em>not<\/em> want to see this as an extension of the Public Theater identity and posters since there are plenty of similarities &mdash; in both execution and graphic chutzpah &mdash; so, as a graphic designer, the system stands apart better from the storied Public Theater work when it uses halftone images. I bet there are a few eagle-eyed New Yorkers who might notice the similarities but, overall, the large &#8220;A&#8221; and knickerbocker color palette will help the Atlantic build its own identity in due time.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1985, Atlantic Theater Company is an Off-Broadway theater in New York, NY, co-founded by playwright David Mamet and the actor William H.
