With over 3.3 billion views and 7 million subscribers, Sing King re-records thousands of tracks with simpler instrumental compositions, adds the synched lyrics, and posts new videos almost every day &#8212; 2,193 videos to date. Based in London, UK, the small company has managed to create, publish, and monetize this tricky content legally, working out agreements with Sony\/ATV, Kobalt, and Universal Music Group. Looking to expand into mobile and smart TV apps as well as and a standalone web destination, Sing King has introduced a new identity designed by London-based <a href=\"https:\/\/nomadstudio.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nomad<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>As leaders in their field, Sing King are well placed to lead the charge with changing the perception of Karaoke. The intention was create a symbol that could become a kite mark of quality for the industry and reflect the global reach of their product.<br \/><br \/>We used the basis of musical notes to create the negative space of the crown, creating a simple yet striking symbol. We&#8217;ve supported this with a word mark and palette of accompanying weights of Sharp Grotesque by Sharp Type.<\/blockquote><h3>Nomad provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sing_king_logo_A.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Sing King by Nomad\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sing_king_logo_colors.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Color variations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo was almost charming in how amateur it was but the key word is <em>almost<\/em> as it was really not a good logo by most standards. To play my own devil&#8217;s advocate though, it did match the essence of karaoke, where anyone can sing and have fun even if their singing is not good singing &#8220;by most standards&#8221;. While the old logo was as literal as it gets with a clip-art crown and a clef spelled out, the new logo is a more interesting interpretation that builds an abstract crown with the help of three music notes in the negative space. Without the name attached to the icon, it would be a hard read but the name allows the icon to instantly pay off. (In my mind, I also see one of those cartoon scenes where a character screams and the &#8220;camera&#8221; zooms in into their tonsils as their uvula swings vigorously, much like when you are hitting those high notes in <em>Let it Go<\/em>.) The wordmark&#8230; I&#8217;m on the fence. I think it works but at the same time maybe it could have been something a lot more fun &#8212; a condensed rounded sans serif, perhaps. The final choice is not wrong though as the type matches the flares of the icon. There is a secondary lock-up used <a href=\"https:\/\/singking.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">in the website<\/a> where the icon sits small in between the two words and that sort of kills the crown effect but, in general, it&#8217;s a fun logo.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sing_king_typography.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Sing King by Nomad\" \/>\n<figcaption>Typography.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sing_king_stickers.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Sing King by Nomad\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sticker type treatments.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sharptype.co\/typefaces\/sharp-grotesk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sharp Grotesk<\/a> is a great type family and its varied widths are put to good use in the sticker treatment that isn&#8217;t the most novel but the addition of the black stroke around the boxes gives it a little extra visual interest. The icon set matches the boxes with their own black stroke and the different tilts make the mono-thickness-line-art approach feel a little different than usual. Even the burn-your-retina color palette feels slightly new as it&#8217;s very appropriate for this identity.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sing_king_icons.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Sing King by Nomad\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icons.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sing_king_youtube_thumbnails_old.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Sing King by Nomad\" \/>\n<figcaption>Existing YouTube thumbnails.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video controls controlsList=\"nodownload\" poster=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sing_king_youtube_thumbnails.png\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sing_king_youtube_thumbnails.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>New YouTube Thumbnails.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>One of the most important applications for Sing King are the thumbnails that appear on YouTube and the existing thumbnails are 100% atrocious. Unlike the old logo, there is no redeeming quality about them. The new thumbnails are bright, happy, bold, and look like a good time waiting to happen. It&#8217;s interesting that they have a big &#8220;KARAOKE&#8221; sticker on them, probably so that they play well in search results.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sing_king_insta_stories.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Instagram stories.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sing_king_website.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Website.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\" style=\"background:black\"><video controls controlsList=\"nodownload\" poster=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sing_king_REMIX.jpg\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sing_king_REMIX.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Short animated promo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sing_king_stickers.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Sing King by Nomad\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stickers.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">The few other, mostly digital, applications shown are solid, with a fun mix of typography, boxes at different angles, and lots of black strokes around things. The design elements yield a very flexible and consistent visual language that is able to make the artist-provided imagery feel almost custom to them. Overall, this is great. It&#8217;s vibrant, it&#8217;s fun, and it&#8217;s cheesy in a sophisticated way that feels quite right for some solo or group karaoke-ing.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 2012, Sing King is the world&apos;s largest online karaoke track depository with a huge presence on YouTube.
