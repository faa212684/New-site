Trolley dodgers. Expos. Metropolitans. Frightening, right?  It&#8217;s one of the many things I love about the game of baseball. Non-threatening mascots.  Bears can be scary, but a cub?  That&#8217;s just cute.  Oh sure, you can hate a Yankee (just ask anyone down south or from New England), but they don&#8217;t really make you quake unless you&#8217;re still living in the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/US_Civil_War\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1860&#8217;s<\/a> or the one facing Joba Chamberlain&#8217;s 98-mph fastball.  Minor League does it even better, with its vast array of gentle souls. Mud hens and Zephyrs. Express trains and Isotopes. Awesome. So I welcome our feisty but not angry wood chewers from the northwest, The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.portlandbeavers.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Portland &#8220;Lucky&#8221; Beavers,<\/a> back to the club with their updated, old-school and, most importantly, friendlier identity.<\/p><!--more--><p>Designed by the ridiculously talented folks at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sandstromdesign.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sandstrom Design<\/a> in Portland, Oregon (natch), the AAA Pacific Coast League team gets a complete makeover aiming for &#8220;contemporary baseball vintage&#8221;. The designers and the team reached back into the team&#8217;s own heritage to create a timeless classic.  A nice round seal? Check. Baseball script on the uni? Check. Real road greys? Check. What&#8217;s not to like? I can&#8217;t even complain about their &#8220;Oregon Beach&#8221;-colored home uniforms &#8211; the latest trend in simulating that old-school flannel look (See also: <a href=\"http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/4n8f9l\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SF Giants<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/3l3kr6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Phillies<\/a>).  And as much as I hate alternate uniforms in the majors, the dark navy negro-league throwback Sunday uni feels right in the minors. <\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"uniforms.jpg\" src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/uniforms.jpg\" width=\"470\" height=\"271\" \/>\n<strong>Home and Alternate Sunday Home uniforms<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The coastal beach and blue color palette seems appropriately derived from the Beavers&#8217; Major League affiliate, the San Diego Padres.  In the grand scheme of things, a color named &#8220;Rose City Accent&#8221; is a bit unnecessary, but the designer in me loves it.  As an identity designer, I love coming up with proprietary color names.  If you haven&#8217;t attempted to name something &#8220;deep purple&#8221;, then you haven&#8217;t lived.  So I completely approve the serendipitous nod to the rockin&#8217; <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/John_Cafferty\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">John Cafferty<\/a> and his favorite color, Beavers Brown.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"padres.jpg\" src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/padres.jpg\" width=\"219\" height=\"189\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"palette.jpg\" src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/palette.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"127\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The mascot itself is based off an older version of the team&#8217;s logo.  I found a version dating back to the mid 1960s, but it could just as well go back to their origins in the early 1900s.  It replaces what I call &#8220;stink eye beaver&#8221;.  As I said, baseball just doesn&#8217;t have threatening logos. This ain&#8217;t the NFL. Even all those indian logos are mostly big-grinned caricatures (I&#8217;m smiling at you, Chief Wahoo). So the former angry beaver just doesn&#8217;t fit.  Besides, how are you supposed to hit a baseball with one eye closed?  <\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"formermascots.jpg\" src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/formermascots.jpg\" width=\"342\" height=\"187\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Finally, the use of the beaver tail is just sweet typographic dessert.  On the cap logo, it&#8217;s the bottom arc of the script P.  On the uniform script, it&#8217;s the fat end of the B in Beaver and P in Portland. <\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"beaverscript.jpg\" src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/beaverscript.jpg\" width=\"214\" height=\"117\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"p_logo.jpg\" src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/p_logo.jpg\" width=\"191\" height=\"191\" \/><\/p>\n<p>It might be time for a road trip, because I&#8217;m definitely eager to see this identity in action.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"pMLB2-4511455dt.jpg\" src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/pMLB2-4511455dt.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" \/>\n<span class=\"small\"><strong>Hat image \ufffdmilb.com<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Thanks to Darrin Crescenzi for the tip.<\/strong><\/small><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":16,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,26,87],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/625"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/16"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=625"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/625\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=625"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=625"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=625"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
