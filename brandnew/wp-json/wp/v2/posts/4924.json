Founded in 1936, Consumer Reports has achieved substantial gains for consumers on food and product safety, financial reform, health reform, and many other issues. The organization has advanced important policies to prohibit predatory lending practices, combat dangerous toxins in food, and cut hospital-acquired infections. Consumer Reports tests and rates thousands of products and services in its 50-plus labs, state-of-the-art auto test center, and consumer research center. It also works to enact pro-consumer laws and regulations in Washington, D.C., in statehouses, and in the marketplace. An independent nonprofit, Consumer Reports accepts no advertising, payment, or other support from the companies that create the products it evaluates.&#8221;<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/consumer_reports_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo for Consumer Reports by Pentagram\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/consumer_reports_logo_cr.png\" alt=\"New Logo for Consumer Reports by Pentagram\" \/>\n<figcaption>Monogram.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/consumer_reports_magazine_before_after.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Consumer Reports by Pentagram\" \/>\n<figcaption>Magazine, before and after.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/consumer_reports_magazine.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Consumer Reports by Pentagram\" \/>\n<figcaption>Magazine.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"(Est. 1936) &quot;Consumer Reports is the world&apos;s largest and most trusted nonprofit consumer organization, working to improve the lives of consumers by driving marketplace change.
