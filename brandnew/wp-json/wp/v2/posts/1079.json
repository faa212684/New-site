Established in New York in 1985, GLAAD &#8220;amplifies the voice of the LGBT community by empowering real people to share their stories, holding the media accountable for the words and images they present, and helping grassroots organizations communicate effectively.&#8221; Working from that key word, <em>amplifying<\/em>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lippincott.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lippincott<\/a> worked pro-bono to create their new identity, which was introduced this past March 13 at the 21st Annual GLAAD Media Awards in New York.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/glaad_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"Glaad\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/glaad_logo_colors.gif\" alt=\"Glaad\" \/><\/p>\n<blockquote>The new GLAAD identity is simple and clear; it plays off a recognized symbol for communication to represent the organization&#8217;s programmatic work to empower LGBT people and allies to share their stories, hold the media accountable for the words and images they present, and help grassroots organizations communicate effectively.  By ensuring that the stories of LGBT people are heard through the media, GLAAD promotes understanding, increases acceptance, and advances equality.  Four separate color versions of the logo are in use, in vibrant orange, green, blue, and purple. This flexibility showcases GLAAD&#8217;s range of work, from the GLAAD Media Awards to programmatic resources for media to report on LGBT issues. The colors express the diversity, energy and passion within GLAAD and the shape of the mark suggests movement, growth and momentum-all key ingredients in GLAAD&#8217;s work to build support for full equality through the media.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.glaad.org\/Page.aspx?pid=1409\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press Release<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/glaad_logo_spectrum_big.gif\" onclick=\"window.open('https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/glaad_logo_spectrum_big.gif','popup','width=1200,height=422,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/glaad_logo_spectrum_sm.gif\" alt=\"Glaad\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Color spectrum. Click image for bigger view.<\/p>\n<p>The old logo was designed by Enterprise IG, and while it had some interesting metaphors going for it &mdash; is it a minority joining a majority? Is it various ways of life? &mdash; it was probably too ambiguous to hold the attention of the media. In contrast, the new logo is very clear in what it&#8217;s trying to communicate, even if some might comment here that it looks like a Wi-Fi icon. Whether it&#8217;s communication, connectivity or amplification, the icon works remarkably well and, to sweeten the deal, it even looks great. A nice detail &mdash; and I bring this up because most logos we review here fail miserably on the details &mdash; is how nicely the first wave of the icon aligns with the stem of the &#8220;d.&#8221; The four color variations for the logo are nice if a bit unnecessary, but why not flaunt that pretty logo in pretty colors, right?<\/p>\n<p>More than anything, it&#8217;s nice to see pro-bono work being treated with the same dedication as well-paid work.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/glaad_collateral_00.gif\" alt=\"Glaad\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/glaad_collateral_01.gif\" alt=\"Glaad\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/glaad_media_awards.jpg\" alt=\"Glaad\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">GLAAD 21st Annual Media Awards event and program.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to Cary Whitt for first tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_100419_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_100419_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_100419_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_100419_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_100419_config_03.xml&#038;xyz=poll_100419_votes_03.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv3\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv3\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,63,26],"tags":[103,104,105,106,107,42],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1079"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1079"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1079\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1079"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1079"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1079"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
