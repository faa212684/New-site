(To be honest, I tried to read through the whole site but I&#8217;m still not clear what they do.) Globetouch has 10 offices and 6 data centers around the world. Their new identity has been designed by London- and Zagreb-based <a href=\"http:\/\/bunchdesign.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bunch<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><p>There are a few more images at <a href=\"http:\/\/bunchdesign.com\/work\/globetouch\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bunch&#8217;s project page<\/a>.<\/p>\n<blockquote>The arms on letters &#8216;G&#8217;, &#8216;e&#8217; and &#8216;c&#8217; are custom cut at an angle of 23 degrees, inspired by the axial tilt of the Earth. Subtle arrow within the letter &#8216;G&#8217; is inspired by the rotating motion of the Globe and it provides continuity with the previous Globetouch symbol.<\/blockquote><h3>Bunch provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/globetouch_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Globetouch by Bunch\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo, despite being as cheesy as a Chicago deep dish pizza, communicated global connectivity and techie-ness but the execution was both terrible and clich\u00e9. I gave that brief glimpse of praise to the old logo mostly because the new logo is very generic and could be for anything, from a nightclub in Berlin to a new range of milk in Switzerland. Not all logos have to <em>say<\/em> something but this one manages to say less than most. The custom &#8220;G&#8221; with the very low-sitting &#8220;chin&#8221; that forms an arrow is distracting and opens up a very wide space at the beginning of the logo. It&#8217;s well kerned, so it has that going for it!<\/p>\n<blockquote>Icons enable users to navigate tasks and ideas with intuition, speed and ease. Simple and geometric, Globetouch&#8217;s icons work equally well both as tools and as expressions of our brand. Globetouch&#8217;s information language is derived from and inspired by the binary code. Ones and zeroes are replaced with lines and circles in order to create a device which is used when designing information effectively.<\/blockquote><h3>Bunch provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/globetouch_icons.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Globetouch by Bunch\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icons.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/globetouch_icons_explained.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Globetouch by Bunch\" \/>\n<figcaption>What the icons stand for.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The small set of three icons are nice abstractions for hard-to-describe services so more bonus points for visualizing these in graphic form.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/globetouch_01_apps_at_a_glance.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Globetouch by Bunch\" \/>\n<figcaption>Applications overview.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The application kicks the generic logo into high gear with the introduction of circle patterns used thoroughly in the website and print.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/160770037?color=fff500&#038;title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"500\" height=\"252\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Dot patterns animations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/globetouch_02_business_cards.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Globetouch by Bunch\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/globetouch_03_business_cards_detail.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Globetouch by Bunch\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/globetouch_04_boxes.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Globetouch by Bunch\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business card boxes.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/globetouch_05_notepad.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Globetouch by Bunch\" \/>\n<figcaption>Notepad.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/globetouch_06_brochures.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Globetouch by Bunch\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brochures.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/globetouch_07_brochures_detail_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Globetouch by Bunch\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/globetouch_07_brochures_detail_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Globetouch by Bunch\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brochure detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">The print applications are quite nice, using reflex blue as an accent, embossing the dot patterns when possible, and the overall typography should please Swiss Style wonks. What made this project work for me was the brochure above, that takes the dot pattern in a different direction offering a wonderful sense of depth and perfectly placed on the brochure cover. I wish there was a little bit more of that tension throughout the applications but for an industry (cloud services) that is usually all about literal clouds and swooshes and bad type like Globetouch&#8217;s old logo this is remarkably sophisticated and professional.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 2010, Globetouch offers access to a &quot;cloud-based global ecosystem&quot; for operators so that they can introduce mobile devices or Internet-of-things products that can plug and play anywhere in select markets around the world.
