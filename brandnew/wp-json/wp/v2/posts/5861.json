It was one of the first online greeting card businesses when it launched that has grown to have 3.6 million active customers in the UK, Australia, and USA, and has has sent more than 60 million cards over the years. Moonpig recently introduced a new identity designed in-house in collaboration with a team of outside consultants that included <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ianstyles.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ian Styles<\/a>, Simon Smith, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.giveupart.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Stuart Hammersley<\/a>, and <a href=\"http:\/\/f37foundry.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">F37 Foundry<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>Building on their new positioning our idea was a simple one; create a whole new world for Moonpig, one where we imagine that we live life on the moon, where the normal rules don&#8217;t apply.<br \/><br \/>The logotype is playfully designed to compress down to form a subtle reference to a pig&#8217;s snout in small spaces and extend out to allow play with horizontal formats and interact with the new TV jingle.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ianstyles.com\/moonpig\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ian Styles project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/moonpig_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Moonpig done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/moonpig_logo_animation.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Moonpig done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo animation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/moonpig_logo_flexibility.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Moonpig done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo variations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t know of Moonpig before writing this so I&#8217;m not sure how much equity the body-less pig head in a space helmet logo had but I am guessing quite a bit. It wasn&#8217;t particularly good but I doubt it was trying to be good anyway and instead simply being humorous and slightly ludicrous along with the name, that has nothing to do with selling greeting cards. (It all had a very early-dot-com-era flair to it.) The pig logo did limit the company to selling only funny things &#8212; which do account for much of its inventory &#8212; but if you are buying flowers, there is a bit of a disconnect. The new logo does away with the pig and introduces a simple, wordmark that alludes to space by having its characters floating in space. Even if that&#8217;s not evident at first glance &#8212; as was my case &#8212; the effect can simply come across as playful and festive. The pink color is unexpected but works quite well and pays homage to the retired pig, as does the snout icon, which is totally great.<\/p>\n<blockquote>We worked extensively with British based type company F37 Foundry to create and develop a custom bespoke type family that would play a key role in Moonpig&#8217;s new brand identity. Both companies worked together using the F37 Ginger type family as the foundations, creating a new Demi weight called Moonpig Lift-Off.<br \/><br \/>This weight features 3 styles of alternates with random programming, giving it a playful yet structured execution. It consists of 4 subclasses: a regular class for the normal design of the characters, one class for the &#8216;lift&#8217; characters, another class for the &#8216;wobbly&#8217; characters and one for the more complex group of characters &#8212; those that &#8216;shake&#8217;.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ianstyles.com\/moonpig\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ian Styles project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/moonpig_type_styles_01.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Moonpig done In-house\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/moonpig_type_styles_02.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Moonpig done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Typographic styles.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/moonpig_packaging.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Moonpig done In-house\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/moonpig_packaging_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Moonpig done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>I love the simplicity of the typographic approach that takes a standard sans serif and gives it a ton of personality by simply shifting the baseline and rotating the characters ever so slightly. Also, having the font do this programmatically ensures that the executions are consistent and easy to implement. And, again, as basic as it is, it is surprisingly expressive in application. Those boxes above have nothing other than type but they are full of personality. The vibrant pastel color palette is quite nice too.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/moonpig_livery.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Moonpig done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Livery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/moonpig_tote.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Moonpig done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Tote.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/moonpig_posters.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Moonpig done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Ad.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/G__oCF0-pi4\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>TV spot.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">Overall, this is a fantastic update that sheds the dot-com aesthetics and drops the mascot-led marketing in exchange for something that is able to span more product categories, welcome a broader audience, and communicate in a charming, playful, and expressive manner.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 2000, Moonpig is a UK-based, online retailer specializing in personalized greeting cards, flowers, and gifts.
