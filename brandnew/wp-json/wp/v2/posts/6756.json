Its name, and part of what makes this interesting, comes from the building it&#8217;s housed in: a 2,000-square-meter (6,500-square-foot) factory originally used for the production of hot air balloon canvas, built in the 1850s &#8212; it originally had a courtyard with no ceiling, allowing balloons to launch from inside. Now, guests will be able to do crossfit in its atrium, sip adult beverages, and enjoy some art all in the same building. The identity for La Mongolfi\u00e8re has been designed by Paris-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.brandbrothers.fr\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brand Brothers<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lamontgolfiere_the_space_a.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for La Mongolfi\u00e8re by Brand Brothers\" \/>\n<figcaption>The space.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The logo, a typogram entirely designed for La Montgolfi\u00e8re, is a statutory lettering including subtle graphic accidents, revealing a bold state of mind. The &#8220;O&#8217;s&#8221; are transformed into monograms, revealing the simplified design of a hot-air balloon. Supported by a simple graphic system, based on a fir green (the initial hue of the beams forming the framework of the facade) and the Panamera character, we have developed for pre-opening a visual language based on multiple typographical and photographic compositions and the production of strong verbal hooks. Posters, postcards, socks, totes bags, t-shits, flags, but above all a monumental tulle flag (6 meters high) welcomed a few hundred curious people last June. See you in September.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.brandbrothers.fr\/en\/la-montgolfiere-branding-visual-identity-signage\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brand Brothers project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lamontgolfiere_logo_formula.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for La Mongolfi\u00e8re by Brand Brothers\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo formula.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lamontgolfiere_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for La Mongolfi\u00e8re by Brand Brothers\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lamontgolfiere_icon.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for La Mongolfi\u00e8re by Brand Brothers\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icon.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The logo is a bit on the awkward side but I think it leans so hard into its awkwardness that it works (at least it does for a hot-air-balloon-turned-gym kind of place). It&#8217;s a long name and there is a lot going on in it: there are ligatures, there is an upside down &#8220;T&#8221;, a lowercase &#8220;i&#8221; among all uppercase letters, and two &#8220;O&#8221;s drawn as abstract hot air balloons. My gut reaction is that I don&#8217;t quite like it but at the same time I like the amount of no fucks given: the logo does what it wants and the identity has gots its back.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lamontgolfiere_identity_elements.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for La Mongolfi\u00e8re by Brand Brothers\" \/>\n<figcaption>Type and color.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lamontgolfiere_taglines.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for La Mongolfi\u00e8re by Brand Brothers\" \/>\n<figcaption>Taglines.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Like the logo, the identity is a mix of ideas and approaches, starting with the copywriting that conveys the different offerings of the place by combining loose words in French and English that sound like a healthy hipster&#8217;s to-do list.

There is a great sense of playfulness and even though the identity is already quite out there these posters really let loose with some awkward imagery, compositions, and word associations. The other applications &#8212; the first set of posters, postcards, etc. &#8212; are also good but feel like they are trying harder to look cool.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lamontgolfiere_totes.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for La Mongolfi\u00e8re by Brand Brothers\" \/>\n<figcaption>Tote bags.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lamontgolfiere_socks_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for La Mongolfi\u00e8re by Brand Brothers\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lamontgolfiere_socks_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for La Mongolfi\u00e8re by Brand Brothers\" \/>\n<figcaption>Socks.
