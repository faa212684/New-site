(I have driven past it a few times and never realized what it was but it looks cool as hell from outside). The identity has been designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/fodastudio.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">F\u00d6DA<\/a> and since the applications are very straightforward it will all depend on the logo whether you like this or not. I do. I really like how it&#8217;s a little puzzle that needs to be solved and isn&#8217;t meant to be perfectly readable. The &#8220;N&#8221; might the be the one character that stumps people, but since &#8220;hewn&#8221; is a word, it&#8217;s feasible to expect people to make the jump. If you don&#8217;t like the logo that much, then you might be swayed by its application in and on materials that extend beyond foil stamping and colored paper like giant metal canisters of some kind that would have been perfect for that woodchopper scene in <em>Fargo<\/em>. <a href=\"http:\/\/fodastudio.com\/projects\/hewn-at-work\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Forward Design Festival by ZWUPP <\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_forwardfest.jpg\" alt=\"Forward Design Festival by ZWUPP\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/forwardcreatives.com\/conference\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Forward Design Festival<\/a> took place earlier this month in Vienna, Austria, and the design team behind the identity, <a href=\"http:\/\/zwupp.at\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Zwupp<\/a>, took inspiration from theirs and the festival&#8217;s location roots in the form of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theviennasecession.com\/monograms\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">monograms of the artists<\/a> of the early 1900s artist community <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wiener_Werkst%C3%A4tte\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte<\/a>. This is one project where the end result might not seem the most evidently cool but the concept behind it and the ingredients that make it happen are. (Long way of saying, click the full project link and don&#8217;t skip the first part.) The resulting materials have a cool balance of crazyness and straightforwardness that create some entertaining layouts and applications. The rotated typography is a growing trend that I&#8217;m still unsure if I like or not but here it seems to go with the quirky flow. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/36271887\/Forward-Design-Festival\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Oslo Design Fair by Bielke&amp;Yang<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_oslodesignfair.jpg\" alt=\"Oslo Design Fair by Bielke&amp;Yang\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.oslodesignfair.com\/en\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Oslo Design Fair<\/a> is Norway&#8217;s largest trade fair for the design and interior decor industry. The new identity for the fair designed by  local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/bielkeyang.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bielke&amp;Yang<\/a> pairs a custom sans serif font with a joyful pattern designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/themvm.com\/work\/oslo_design_fair_environm\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MVM<\/a> that draws from the products and textiles in the show. The &#8220;O&#8221;, &#8220;D&#8221;, &#8220;F&#8221; letters pick out different parts of the illustration and serve as the key (and bold) visual in the otherwise spare layouts.
