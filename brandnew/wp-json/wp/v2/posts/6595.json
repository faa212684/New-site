(Their name, a playful take on &#8220;pixels&#8221; keeps tripping me up when I try to write it.) The identity, designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.and-studio.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A.N.D. Studio\u00ad<\/a> is dead simple, with a monospace font featuring some extra loopy &#8220;l&#8221;s. It isn&#8217;t the most amazing logo but it looks great when applied, especially embossed in the business cards where its thinness yields a very elegant raised surface. The light gray, light brown, and light blue color palette is lovely too, adding a touch of warmth to an otherwise bare identity. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.and-studio.co.uk\/projects\/pikcells\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Musicalist by Monumento<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_musicalist.jpg\" alt=\"Musicalist by Monumento\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/musicalist.mx\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Musicalist<\/a> is a team of &#8220;ambient sartorialists&#8221; in San Pedro Garza Garc\u00eda, Mexico, that, in less pretentious terms, it means they curate sound and visual environments for hotels, restaurants, and retail spaces. The identity, designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/monumento.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Monumento<\/a> features a simple logo with a music-wave-&#8220;M&#8221; that blends into a hipster-y sans serif. The applications carry on the hipstery vibe but I&#8217;ll admit that there is something pleasing about the compositions of the business card and letterhead and I particularly like the subtle debossed line details that separate the information. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/monumento.co\/work\/musicalist\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Havet by Mayra Monobe<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_havet.gif\" alt=\"Havet by Mayra Monobe\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/havet.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Havet<\/a> is a new Spanish line of watches for men and women. Like the watches, the logo is simple, elegant, and slightly playful. Designed by Barcelona, Spain-based <a href=\"http:\/\/mayramonobe.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mayra Monobe<\/a>, the &#8220;V&#8221; in the logo is transformed into the hands of a watch set at 10:10 (the same time most watches are set at when photographed). They certainly took good advantage of having a &#8220;V&#8221; in their name and then executing it nicely. The dead-simple packaging comes alive thanks to a very vibrant color combination of red-orange and dark blue. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/mayramonobe.com\/havet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Full-on minimalist projects this week, with work from Huddersfield, San Pedro Garza Garc\u00eda, and Barcelona&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[51,11,26],"tags":[1015,756,42,395],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6595"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=6595"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6595\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=6595"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=6595"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=6595"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
