In 2002, the International Gay Rugby Association and Board awarded the San Francisco Fog, a club Mark Bingham founded, the right to host the first official gay rugby world cup tournament. The Bingham Cup was born. As a man, Mark smashed the gay stereotype and the tournament in his name continues to do the same. Next year, when the tournament arrives in Sydney, teams will tackle more than each other. The players and their supporters will make a stand for inclusion, participation, equality, for diversity and for each other.&#8221; (Source: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.coastdesign.com.au\/work\/bingham-cup-sydney-2014\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Coast Design<\/a>)<\/p><!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bingham_cup_logo_animation.gif\" alt=\"New Logo for Bingham Cup 2014 by Coast Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo animation\/explanation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bingham_cup_photos.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Bingham Cup 2014 by Coast Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo and video launch event.
