From his multiple hikes, canoe trips, and dogsled runs, Lars has gathered enough experience and fans to write over 18 books. His next frontier is product branding, partnering with existing outdoor brands he has used and vetted to create new products made to his specifications; from a new line of <a href=\"http:\/\/komplettfritid.no\/search?q=Lars+Monsen+Anarjohka\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">underwear garments<\/a> with Komplettfritid to an upcoming range of knives with Brussleto.

Paired with a strong portrait image, capturing Lars&#8217; familiar and climate hardened image and tinted red, our solution is expressive and communicative at any size and within any context.<\/blockquote><h3>Provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lars_morsen_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Lars Monsen by Str&oslash;mme Throndsen Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lars_monsen_photo.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Lars Monsen by Str&oslash;mme Throndsen Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Lars duotone.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo was kind of amazing, in a kitschy, unfocused way and more appropriate for an astronaut than a nature rover like Lars. The new logo features a clever &#8220;LM&#8221; monogram that looks like much of the stencil lettering and red-orange color you find silkscreened on the side of outdoor products (or at least on our REI-bought tent). The nod to a steep mountain climb also comes through with the sloped &#8220;L&#8221;. The wordmark, unfortunately, doesn&#8217;t have any of the personality that the monogram has and even if it&#8217;s meant to play a supporting role it feels too &#8220;default&#8221;. I&#8217;m even surprised it&#8217;s not Circular by Lineto because that&#8217;s what everything is these days.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lars_monsen_business_card.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Lars Monsen by Str&oslash;mme Throndsen Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lars_monsen_product_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Lars Monsen by Str&oslash;mme Throndsen Design\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lars_monsen_product_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Lars Monsen by Str&oslash;mme Throndsen Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sample products.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lars_monsen_website.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Lars Monsen by Str&oslash;mme Throndsen Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Upcoming website.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lars_monsen_poster.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Lars Monsen by Str&oslash;mme Throndsen Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Poster.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">In application, the identity is quite straightforward focusing on Lars&#8217; distinctive face that looks even more rugged and awesome as a duotone.
