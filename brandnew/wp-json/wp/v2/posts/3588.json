(Their projects do last longer that one second). Designed by fellow Portonians, <a href=\"http:\/\/r2design.pt\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">R2 Design<\/a>, the identity uses a vibrant RGB color palette and giant, blocky number 1s along with a double prime symbol to represent second, a somewhat underused graphic (and even writing) device. It&#8217;s a simple and bold mark that looks great oversize on the stationery. The complementing Neutraface-ish wordmark adds a nice contrast and touch of classic Hollywood. <a href=\"http:\/\/r2design.pt\/index2.php?id=197\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Albertine by Pentagram<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_albertine.jpg\" alt=\"Albertine by Pentagram\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/albertine.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Albertine<\/a> is &#8220;the only reading room and bookshop in New York devoted solely to books in French and English with more than 14,000 contemporary and classic titles from 30 French-speaking countries&#8221; so, of course, it has to look French as fries. To do the classy deed, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pentagram.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pentagram<\/a> partner Abbott Miller designed a beautiful, custom-drawn wordmark based on French vernacular packaging that has a lovely extended and geometric structure. Behind it (and sometimes above it) the wordmark is accompanied by a golden burst that references a mural on the ceiling of the bookstore. The combination of elements, plus the blue and gold palette, make for a very cultured and elegant look that translates just as well to gold leaf on glass as it does to silkscreen on a Tyvek bag. <a href=\"http:\/\/new.pentagram.com\/2014\/10\/new-work-albertine\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Attention: Craft by Snask<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_attncraft.jpg\" alt=\"Attention: Craft by Snask\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">An exhibition that ran this past Summer at the prestigious <a href=\"http:\/\/www.liljevalchs.se\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Liljevalchs<\/a> gallery in Stockholm, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.liljevalchs.se\/utstallningar\/attention-craft\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Attention: Craft<\/a> showcased the work of eleven artists&#8217; experimental craft and their expertise working on different materials &mdash; it was this focus on materials that <a href=\"<a href=\"http:\/\/snask.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Snask<\/a> used to, um, craft this briefly-lived identity. After drawing a quirky wordmark for &#8220;Craft&#8221;, Snask had each letter made from a different material &mdash; copper, marble, porcelain, wood, and stone &mdash; that they photographed to serve as the logo. The textures, reflections, and shadows achieved is just something you can&#8217;t get in Photoshop or 3D rendering. It&#8217;s a stunning visual. The rest of the identity used a stencil font and lot of black to set a serious and crafty vibe. <a href=\"http:\/\/snask.com\/case\/attention-craft\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project here<\/strong><\/a><\/strong>.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Plenty of crafty executions this week with work from Porto, New York, and Stockholm&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[937,134,933,1091],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3588"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3588"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3588\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3588"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3588"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3588"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
