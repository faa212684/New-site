The restaurant&#8217;s laid back, accessible, and cheerful attitude is well represented in its identity, designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.atomicdust.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Atomicdust<\/a>, that consists of a chunky wordmark where the letters alternate between inline and no inline or sometimes half an inline and is supported by a range of illustration work. The basis of it is a set of fabric-like pieces that give it a cool mid-century look and then there is a wobbly line-art set of Italian buildings blown up on the wall and another great mono-thickness line-art illustration on the bag by Adam Koon. Too much? Maybe. But somehow it comes together like the pastas it serves and its mix-and-match ordering system. <strong><span class=\"gray_70\">See full project<\/span> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.atomicdust.com\/work\/porano-pasta-restaurant-branding\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a> <span class=\"gray_70\">and<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/33391795\/Porano\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a><\/strong><\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">driexdrie by George&amp;Harrison<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_driexdrie.jpg\" alt=\"driexdrie by George&amp;Harrison\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.driexdrie.nl\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">driexdrie<\/a> (Three &times; Three in English) is an accounting firm specializing in small- and medium-sized businesses with three offices across the Netherlands and their identity is as simple as 2 plus 2&hellip; or 3 times 3. Designed by Eindhoven-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.georgeandharrison.nl\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">George&amp;Harrison<\/a>, the identity is full of geometric charm, from wordmark to mathematic symbols that turn playful and modern thanks to the almost-salmon red and non-jarring blue. It&#8217;s all very simply and elegantly executed in a way that I would totally trust this people with my monies. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.georgeandharrison.nl\/projecten\/driexdrie\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Lune Croissanterie by A Friend of Mine<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_lune.jpg\" alt=\"Lune Croissanterie by A Friend of Mine\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.lunecroissanterie.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lune Croissanterie<\/a> is a bakery in Melbourne with croissants and other baked goods that have customers lining up from 3:00 in the morning. After an expansion into a bigger location, Lune introduced a new identity designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/afom.com.au\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A Friend of Mine<\/a> who replaced the <a href=\"http:\/\/underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_lune_old.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">old, generic rocket ship logo<\/a> with a simplified, funner rocket with a croissant for fins. Houston, we <em>don&#8217;t<\/em> have a problem! They also added a simple, bold wordmark and a &#8220;hyperdrive&#8221; graphic element that is die-cut on the boxes to give the pastries ventilation and also inspired the light fixtures in the new location&#8217;s kitchen. To top things off, the black ink on the packaging is sprinkled with a subtle glitter coating for extra awesomeness. <a href=\"http:\/\/afom.com.au\/work\/lune-croissanterie\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Whether hungry or in need of accounting services, we&apos;ve got you covered with work from St. Louis, Eindhoven, and Melbourne&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[1243,1065,564],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4493"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4493"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4493\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4493"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4493"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4493"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
