Designed by Brooklyn, NY-based <a href=\"https:\/\/triborodesign.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Triboro<\/a>, the identity features abstract spray-painted-like textures (that maybe evoke the actual golden hour that takes place after sunrise or before sunset) printed on gold paper but even if they are not meant to evoke nothing are pretty stunning to look at. The logo splits into a crisp hourglass icon and a groovy Art Deco-ish wordmark with letters high and low &#8212; I don&#8217;t know why the letters do this but, again, nice to look at. The menus have octagon cut-out because I don&#8217;t know but &#8212; guess what? &#8212; it&#8217;s nice to look at as well and even better to see the remnant octagon pieces on their own. There are a lot of unanswered questions about why this is how it is but maybe we ask too many questions. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/triborodesign.com\/work\/the-golden-hour\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Ellington by Hmmm Creative Studio<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_ellington.jpg\" alt=\"Ellington by Hmmm Creative Studio\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/ellington-printing.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ellington<\/a> is a printer in Tallinn, Estonia, with a funky identity designed by local firm <a href=\"https:\/\/hmmmcreative.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hmmm Creative Studio<\/a>. Revolving around eyes, there is eyes everywhere you look (pun!). How many eyes? Business-cards-shaped-like-eyes-with-eyes-on-them many. Maybe it&#8217;s too many eyes but I found it all to be lighthearted and a little trippy, all deployed in a soft color palette and accentuated by nice typography. The logo is a little too <a href=\"https:\/\/non-aliencreatures.fandom.com\/wiki\/Pale_Man\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pale Man-esque<\/a> so I&#8217;ll just try to ignore that. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/76762823\/Ellington\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Kinfelts by Studio Oeding<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_kinfelts.jpg\" alt=\"Kinfelts by Studio Oeding\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.kinfelts.de\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kinfelts<\/a> is an upscale bistro in Hamburg, Germany. The identity, designed by local firm <a href=\"https:\/\/www.studio-oeding.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Studio Oeding<\/a>, is able to convey the high-end aspect through the use of gold foil and a lovely color palette of olive green, mustard yellow, black, and white but is complemented by a nice range of hand-drawn details, from the crisp script logo in a thin line stroke to rugged fonts to a lovely hand-painted sign on the wall. When the elements overlap as in the coasters or the label (on the header image) it&#8217;s like a great dish with an unexpected combination of elements. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.studio-oeding.com\/kinfelts\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Some effusive and textural projects this week, with work from Brooklyn, Tallinn, and Hamburg&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,85,26],"tags":[1237,1682,997,564,1683],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7532"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=7532"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7532\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=7532"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=7532"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=7532"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
