For those interested, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.aaltoyliopisto.info\/files\/0120_e_aalto_university_presentation_final.pdf\">a handy PDF<\/a> explains everything in detail about this new institution. While everything about this school indicates a forward-looking vision, they decided to hold a backwards-acting contest to determine its visual identity. Open to students, staff and alumni of Aalto University, the contest was open from March to April and a few weeks ago <a href=\"http:\/\/www.aaltoyliopisto.info\/en\/news\/kutsu-invitation-by-rasmus-snabb-selected-as-a-winning-entry-of-the-aalto-university-visual-identity-contest\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the winner was announced<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/aalto_university_olds.gif\" alt=\"Previous Logos\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Logos of the Helsinki School of Economics, the University of Art and Design Helsinki and the Helsinki University of Technology.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The winner, <a href=\"http:\/\/by.rasmussnabb.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rasmus Snabb<\/a>, a graphic designer and a former student of the University of Art and Design Helsinki named his entry <em>Kutsu<\/em>, &#8220;Invitation&#8221; in English, and in his web site explains the concept:<\/p>\n<blockquote>What defines the image of an educational institution? Discussion, evaluation, change. A school is constantly re-evaluating, discussing and adjusting the way it organizes itself and its activities. The image of a school is thus undefinable &mdash; it is in constant change. This is why the logo should not provide a static predefined image, but a blank canvas, which will in time be attached with meaning &mdash; an identity created and experienced by the students, researchers and employees.<\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/aalto_university_alts.gif\" alt=\"Aalto University Logo, Alternatives\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Alternatives of the logo, and use in other languages.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>And further on the actual execution:<\/p>\n<blockquote>The logo doesn&#8217;t have a static visual form, it can be endlessly rearranged and changed. The typeface Helvetica has been chosen because it is the most &#8220;meaningless&#8221; typeface. The primary colours are used because in this combination they have no symbolic value but merely represent &#8220;all colours.&#8221;<\/blockquote>\n<p>While I will never encourage contests to define identity design, I have to admit this is a pretty well thought out result that also happens to look pretty good. I think something other than Helvetica &mdash; something with enough neutrality but a little more warmth and personality &mdash; would have been much more appropriate, specially since Helvetica has become a cliche for neutrality. Nonetheless, I really like the visual strategy of this logo and how it can change yet still maintain a very consistent texture and recognizable identity. Above all, the concept is just plain good and you don&#8217;t need to have it explained to be understood, it&#8217;s quite evident that this logo (or, well, <em>these<\/em> logos) represent a different kind of university that is willing to look at things differently.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.paperjam.fi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jyri Niemi<\/a> for the tip.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[29,12,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/843"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=843"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/843\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=843"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=843"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=843"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
