Over 34,000 employees work across a retail network that includes approximately 4,700 company-operated stores in the United States and Mexico. The last time we talked about Radio Shack here was for their &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_shack_aw_shucks.php#.UdvmdT77190\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Shack<\/a>&#8221; campaign, which has come and gone. Its most recent brand message, &#8220;Radioshack: Let&#8217;s Play&#8221; was introduced this March with the purpose of establishing the retailer as &#8220;a neighborhood technology playground.&#8221; With these two ideas in place, Radioshack has opened a concept store in New York to showcase said playground-ness and introduce a new logo. No design credit given, but the creative agency of record is <a href=\"http:\/\/grey.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Grey<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/radioshack_2013_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Retail Concept for Radioshack\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>&#8220;I am very excited about this store, which brings the essence of our new &#8216;RadioShack: Let&#8217;s Play&#8217; branding to the heart of Manhattan, and I am also thrilled about the support and very positive reactions of our neighbors,&#8221; said Joe Magnacca, chief executive officer of RadioShack Corporation.  &#8220;Our goal at RadioShack is to make our iconic brand relevant to new segments of the consumer market, while reinforcing our commitment to the strong and loyal base of customers who have known RadioShack for many years.  We know that all of these consumers like technology when it makes their lives simpler, but they love technology when it makes their lives fun.&#8221;<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/media.radioshackcorporation.com\/phoenix.zhtml?c=242236&#038;p=irol-newsArticle&#038;ID=1834533&#038;highlight=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press Release<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/smaBv2CL3YY\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>New logo pops up at the beginning of this product review.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/radioshack_2013_store_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Retail Concept for Radioshack\" \/>\n<figcaption>PR Newswire caption: &#8220;The new RadioShack concept store at 2268 Broadway in New York showcases the retailer&#8217;s new branding, as well as numerous innovations that enable shoppers to easily find the products they need.&#8221; My caption: This is the block where retailers with circles in their logo need to be.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/radioshack_2013_store_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Retail Concept for Radioshack\" \/>\n<figcaption>PR Newswire caption: &#8220;RadioShack&#8217;s new concept store at 2268 Broadway in New York City has newly configured displays highlighting in-demand brands like Apple, HTC and Samsung, and carriers like AT&amp;T and Verizon&#8221;.

Save for the obvious retouching on the headphones.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The previous logo is a retail classic: easy to spot, easy to remember, and simply executed with the thickness of the circle&#8217;s stroke matching the thickness of the &#8220;R&#8221;&rsquo;s serifs. Not the most terribly exciting logo but it represented the company quite well. The new logo completely crushes the subtleties of the old one with an extra bold, sans serif &#8220;R&#8221; and a much thicker stroke on the circle. If there has ever been a logo equivalent to a boob job and pumping collagen into lips, this is it. To be perfectly honest though there is nothing structurally wrong with the new logo &mdash; it&#8217;s an &#8220;R&#8221; in a circle, you can&#8217;t really screw that up &mdash; it&#8217;s just that evolution-wise it&#8217;s a pretty clumsy step.<\/p>\n<p class=\"end\">The one thing that does baffle me is the color palette. At first I thought the light red and shit brown were the problem of a CMYK file being put up for download. But, nope, the website, in all its RGB glory, uses the light red and shit brown color palette. It seems like a very strange choice to make deliberately. As far as the new stores, they look promising but still operate within that cheap shopping-mall-vibe that one associates with Radioshack. Overall, I will grant that the new logo and stores are more on cue for a younger, hipper crowd that has no associations with the Radioshack of yore and just wants to get the latest cool entertainment gadget without paying Apple-like prices, but&hellip; seriously, shit brown?<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1919, Radioshack is a &quot;national retailer of innovative mobile technology products and services, as well as products related to personal and home technology and power supply needs.&quot; What that means is that it has kind of a double&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,86,26],"tags":[128,40,309,149,849],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2571"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2571"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2571\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2571"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2571"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2571"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
