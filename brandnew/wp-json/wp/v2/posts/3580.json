Now, having pivoted more times than Hakeem Olajuwon, truTV is focusing on &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/pressroom.turner.com\/us\/trutv\/trutv-gets-way-more-fun\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Way More Fun<\/a>&#8221; programming, introducing four new comedy series and a slew of other humor- and reality-based programming. Billed as The New truTV, the channel has introduced a revised logo and new on-air package designed by New York, NY-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.loyalkaspar.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">loyalkaspar<\/a> with additional out of home advertising by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mullen.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mullen<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/trutv_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo and On-air Look for truTV by loyalkaspar\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/trutv_logo_explanation.png\" alt=\"New Logo and On-air Look for truTV by loyalkaspar\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo explanation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/trutv_logo_system.png\" alt=\"New Logo and On-air Look for truTV by loyalkaspar\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icon system.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Clearly not much of a revolution on the logo, more like an uprising. Literally. The &#8220;TV&#8221; dot has been moved from a passive position on the bottom, serving as a supporting punctuation mark, to an active position on the top, serving as an nth-degree mark of sorts. It&#8217;s amazing how a small move like this can change the message. The typography has also been tightened and is specially effective in the narrower &#8220;u&#8221;. The new ability to put different icons inside the circle gives the logo extra functionality. Overall, the logo now has better balance and feels more engaging.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/KWpJLXV3Lvc\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Brand manifesto.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/109297196\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>New on-air package.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/110842678\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>&#8220;Brand bursts&#8221;.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>On air, the new identity is, as would be expected, fast and playful, without having overwhelming animation behaviors. Instead of motion-graphic pyrotechnics, the package relies on a handful of perky typefaces to convey the attitude of the channel through subtle, bouncy animations that also bring to life the logo and show icons.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/trutv_advertising_outdoor.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and On-air Look for truTV by loyalkaspar\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/trutv_advertising_outdoor_2.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and On-air Look for truTV by loyalkaspar\" \/>\n<figcaption>Outdoor advertising and acronyms.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">Perhaps my favorite bit of this relaunch is the out of home advertising photo above where a number of scattered, small billboards convey the same kind of bounciness from the motion work. Mullen has also introduced some acronyms on steroids that are kind of funny &mdash; or, at least, the &#8220;My Eyes Are Puking Rainbows&#8221; line is. Overall, the message is clear about the new truTV, you won&#8217;t find any court proceedings here anymore; instead it&#8217;s all shits and giggles now and that&#8217;s something we can all handle.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Originally launched in 1991 as Court TV and focusing on seemingly endless live coverage of court trials, truTV as it was renamed in 2008 is an American cable channel owned by Turner Broadcasting System that, at the time, turned its&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,66,26],"tags":[617,596,589,290],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3580"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3580"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3580\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3580"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3580"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3580"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
