Recently renamed <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sankeo.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sank\u00e9o<\/a>, the company introduced a new identity designed by Paris- and Lyon-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.grapheine.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Graph\u00e9ine<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>The acronym CTPM becomes &#8220;Sank\u00e9o&#8221;, a modern version of the Catalan slang expression for &#8220;blood and gold&#8221; [(&#8220;Sang et Or&#8221;)], a nod to the inhabitants of French Catalonia. While keeping a foot in tradition and heritage with graphic codes echoing the territory (the stripes of the Catalan coat of arms, the facets of a garnet, optical art, etc.), this new image is resolutely future-oriented, especially towards young people, the faces of the tomorrow&#8217;s mobility.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.grapheine.com\/en\/portfolio\/sankeo-transport-perpignan-mediterranee\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Graph\u00e9ine project page (Google-translated)<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sankeo_logo_concept_2.png\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Sank\u00e9o by Graph\u00e9ine\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo and identity concepts.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sankeo_logo.png\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Sank\u00e9o by Graph\u00e9ine\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo with tagline, &#8220;Every day is a new departure&#8221;.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sankeo_logo_colors.png\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Sank\u00e9o by Graph\u00e9ine\" \/>\n<figcaption>Color variations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo was really bad with some kind of breezy grunge font &#8212; those aligning &#8220;p&#8221;s! &#8212; loosely letterspaced next to a colored tile that also appears on the commune&#8217;s logo so I guess <em>that<\/em> makes sense. Certainly, nothing worth keeping. The new logo is&#8230; unexpected. Of all the things a seaside community bus system&#8217;s logo could look like, this is probably the last direction I would have seen coming. The logo takes its faceted edges from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=granet+stone+france&#038;oq=granet+stone+france&#038;aqs=chrome..69i57.3823j0j7&#038;sourceid=chrome&#038;ie=UTF-8#q=garnet+stone+france\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the garnet stone<\/a> which I assume may be a thing particular to the region and perhaps recognizable to the locals. Regardless, the logo is memorable, in both good and bad ways. I&#8217;m torn between liking it and disliking it. I like how it&#8217;s different from pretty much anything else but I don&#8217;t like the letterforms, particularly the &#8220;n&#8221; next to the uppercase &#8220;K&#8221;.
