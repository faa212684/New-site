The Lightning won the Stanley Cup in the 2004 &ndash; 05 season and in the following season, trying to defend their championship, they were eliminated by the Senators in the first round of the playoffs. I bet there is some poetic justice there for Senators fans. The Lightning have had two very crappy seasons after those glory days and now seem determined to get some thunder going behind them. Yesterday, they announced new uniforms, which will be used starting next season, and a new identity designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/lightning.nhl.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SME Branding<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>The Lightning worked with SME, a strategic brand development firm servicing the sports and entertainment industries, to create the new logo. &#8220;Bold&#8221;, &#8220;classic&#8221;, &#8220;iconic&#8221; and &#8220;hockey-centric&#8221; were the words that inspired the new designs. The previous circular logo shape was evolved into a contemporary oval shape to better represent the speed and power of NHL hockey competition as well as the upward direction of the club. One color, Tampa Bay Blue, was retained to honor the past and represent leadership&#8217;s commitment to the area.  In order to create a more uplifting overall presentation &mdash; bright, wide white stripes replace the silver and black, providing a brighter presentation of the Tampa Bay brand.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/lightning.nhl.com\/club\/news.htm?id=551150\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press Release<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tb_lightning_marks.gif\" alt=\"Tampa Bay Lightning\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Primary mark (without name), secondary mark, and patch.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tb_lightning_unis.gif\" alt=\"Tampa Bay Lightning\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Home (above) and away uniforms.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tb_lightning_unis_ph_01.jpg\" alt=\"Tampa Bay Lightning\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tb_lightning_unis_ph_02.jpg\" alt=\"Tampa Bay Lightning\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tb_lightning_brand_vision.jpg\" alt=\"Tampa Bay Lightning\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">&#8220;Vision of the Tampa Bay Lightning.&#8221; Tip to PR folks: Don&#8217;t release images that have been screen-captured and the text is being selected.<\/p>\n<p>If you look <a href=\"http:\/\/sportslogos.net\/team.php?id=27\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">at the history of Tampa Bay Lightning logos<\/a> it&#8217;s easy to see that they do not have the best track record and they prove that you can screw up something as kick-ass as a lightning bolt. Relatively speaking, the new logo is an improvement over the old: It&#8217;s simpler, cleaner, and more efficient with a single color and without all the unnecessary strokes. But, not speaking relatively, the new logo is still dull. The typography is improved, although I have no idea on what kind of fattening steroids that &#8220;B&#8221; is on. The uniforms are what they are, I have never been a big analyzer of uniforms. The best part of the whole identity is the patch, but even that has some half-cooked typography.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a passable evolution, but it certainly has no thunder worth stealing.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.addisonwhitney.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nick Irwin<\/a> for first tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_110202_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_110202_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_110202_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_110202_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_110202_config_03.xml&#038;xyz=poll_110202_votes_03.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv3\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv3\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,26,87],"tags":[292,457,153,42,272,121],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1330"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1330"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1330\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1330"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1330"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1330"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
