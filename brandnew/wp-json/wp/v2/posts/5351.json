The name means &#8220;Ally&#8221; in Catalan, which is apt given the tight alliance between the &#8220;a&#8221; and the &#8220;t&#8221; in the logo. Designed by local designer <a href=\"http:\/\/www.enriquepresa.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Enrique Presa<\/a>, this is   a rarely well done ligature that is unusual (from the fi fl common ligatures) and works great to form a tight, bold wordmark. The application on brown and tan paper with white ink is sophisticated and striking. I would totally take their tax advice. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/47854445\/Aliat-Naming-and-brand-Identity?\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Flyrite by Foxtrot<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_flyrite.jpg\" alt=\"Flyrite by Foxtrot\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.flyritechicken.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Flyrite<\/a> is a small chain of chicken sandwiches in Austin, TX, with only two locations but they are two locations that stand out wildly, with a giant triangle thing and a neon logo on the facade that are hard to miss. Designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/foxtrot.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Foxtrot<\/a>, the logo features a chicken flying just rite&#8230; it&#8217;s a great icon with crisp, strong lines and a bonus &#8220;F&#8221; hidden in its wing. The strength of the logo carries the whole identity, which is fairly basic in a coral red and gray color palette and minimal additional graphics. It&#8217;s the cool, industrial cousin Chick-fil-A never knew it had. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/foxtrot.co\/work\/flyrite-chicken-sandwiches\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Lund\u00e9n Architecture Company by Tsto<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_lunden.gif\" alt=\"Lund\u00e9n Architecture Company by Tsto\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.lunden.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lund\u00e9n Architecture Company<\/a> is, as its name implies, an architecture company in Helsinki, Finland, with a portfolio of some pretty cool and out of the ordinary projects that support the equally out-there new logo designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tsto.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tsto<\/a>. A simple wordmark, typeset in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fontshop.com\/families\/ff-bau\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FF Bau<\/a> is given a literal twist by breaking apart the letterforms into spin-able pieces that separate and come together cyclically in a hypnotic animation. The stroked approach gives it an extra layer of WTFness but it works perfectly in synch with the type of work done by Lund\u00e9n. The backs of the business cards with the different states of the animation are each wonderful typographic compositions on their own. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.tsto.org\/work\/lunden-architecture-company\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/bpando.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Via BP&amp;O<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Clean, bold, and crisp designs and typography abound this week, with work from Palma de Mallorca, Austin, and Helsinki&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[58,36,11,85,26],"tags":[1157,105,406,849,112],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5351"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=5351"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5351\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=5351"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=5351"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=5351"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
