Their identity, designed by <a href=\"https:\/\/facultative.works\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Facultative Works<\/a>, is all kinds of funky and unhinged from any conventions about retail stores that sell eyeglasses. It&#8217;s hard to describe and\/or discern either the concept or the aesthetic other than &#8220;have fun&#8221; and &#8220;make it look cool&#8221;, which may not always fly in this industry but when done with so much conviction and detail as here, well, it&#8217;s damn enjoyable. I love how the P.Y.E transforms into a smiley face, I love all the random shapes and lines, I love the color palette which is a simple muted version of primary colors, and I love all the knickknacks and stickers they&#8217;ve come up with. On top of the fun-ness, there is a great design rigor that ties everything together. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\">See full project <a href=\"https:\/\/facultative.works\/P-Y-E-Identity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/facultative.works\/P-Y-E-Optics-Identity-2-0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Tallinn Music Week 2018 by AKU<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_tallinn_music_festival.jpg\" alt=\"Tallinn Music Week 2018 by AKU\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/tmw.ee\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tallinn Music Week<\/a> is a week-long music festival held every spring since 2009 in Tallinn, Estonia. This year&#8217;s identity, designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.aku.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AKU<\/a>, revolves around a super funky custom font with highly contrasting thin horizontal strokes and thick vertical strokes in a condensed structure that amplifies the contrast. The identity is rendered in a retina-challenging color palette of red, blue, and tan that may be a little on the extreme side but it does look cool. Additionally, there is a surprise element of transparent rods that distort elements of the layouts. I don&#8217;t know their meaning but as a graphic effect I dig it and it certainly goes along with what looks like a fairly avant garde event and audience. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/69502585\/Tallinn-Music-Week-2018\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Dimoni by Forma<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_dimoni.jpg\" alt=\"Dimoni by Forma\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/vdimoni.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dimoni<\/a> is a vermouth named after the devil (demon, dimoni) that features in the story of Sant Antoni and the annual celebration of Sant Antoni&#8217;s day in Mallorca, Spain, where <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?lr=&#038;safe=active&#038;biw=1623&#038;bih=914&#038;tbm=isch&#038;sa=1&#038;ei=W0qSW-P_L4rujwTKjLPgDQ&#038;q=Sant+Antoni+Day+dimoni&#038;oq=Sant+Antoni+Day+dimoni&#038;gs_l=img.3...16313.17263..17654...0.0..0.66.440.7......1....1..gws-wiz-img.ARgjfy0uRv0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">people don large devil masks<\/a>.

The primary serif font for &#8220;DIMONI&#8221; is beautiful and is nicely complemented with a more contemporary, extended sans serif. The low contrast approach &#8212; whether it&#8217;s red-on-tan or black-on-red &#8212; gives it a nice, serious mood and aptly matches the tone of the drink itself. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.forma.co\/project\/dimoni\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"We get a little weird this week with projects from Moscow and St. Petersburg, Tallinn, and Barcelona&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[51,63,11,86,26],"tags":[1605,1237,906,544,395],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6867"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=6867"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6867\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=6867"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=6867"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=6867"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
