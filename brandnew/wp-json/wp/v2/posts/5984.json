The identity by Buffalo, NY-based <a href=\"https:\/\/blockclub.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Block Club<\/a> won&#8217;t win any points for originality or boundary-breaking but it perfectly captures the homey, rustic vibe of the restaurant and its food with a lovely wordmark and an even lovelier &#8220;G&#8221; shorthand version.  The gold foil applications from restaurant exterior to business cards give everything a luxurious look but all the ornaments and pretty type stop it from becoming pretentious.   <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/blockclub.co\/work\/the-grange\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Nuca by Eggplant Factory<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_nuca.jpg\" alt=\"Nuca by Eggplant Factory\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/urnuca.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nuca<\/a> is a cosmetics company in Seoul, South Korea, and that&#8217;s as much information as I can extract, since not only is their site in Korean, many of their descriptions are image files, so Google Translate doesn&#8217;t work. Regardless! Their packaging system by local firm <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/eggplantfactory\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Eggplant Factory<\/a> has a lovely simplicity and a fantastic primary color palette of lavender and pink &#8212; with gray, white, and black as secondary colors &#8212; that, along with a basic sans serif wordmark, look great on the stubby little containers. Like Grange above, nothing groundbreaking, just a set of simple ingredients very nicely calibrated throughout various applications. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/40484867\/nuca-Brand-Design\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Private Lomonosov School by LOCO Studio<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_lomonosov.jpg\" alt=\"Private Lomonosov School by LOCO Studio\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/pls.international\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Private Lomonosov School<\/a> is a private school in Nizhny Novgorod, Russia, offering an international baccalaureate program from (I think) elementary to high school years.

The only complaint is that the gold crest on purple paper should have a negative version so that the gold acts as the white\/highlights of the drawing, but it looks pretty sharp on white. (As a side note in how the gold accents in The Grange project don&#8217;t look pretentious, this is the opposite, where the gold accents makes it look pretentious but for a private school with a crest of a bear and a deer and a graduation cap it makes sense for it to be that way.) <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/58482149\/Private-Lomonosov-School-Nizhny-Novgorod\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Some simple but convincing and enjoyable projects this week, with work from Hamburg (NY), Seoul, and Moscow&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[51,29,11,85,26],"tags":[818,53,564,544],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5984"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=5984"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5984\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=5984"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=5984"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=5984"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
