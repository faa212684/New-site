Local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.moodley.at\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Moodley<\/a> created an ethereal identity that combines a light handwritten logo with thin wobbly lines with a thin monospace typewriter font. The result is almost an imperceptible identity that has a ghostly appeal to it. I think this could benefit from a much better (and less confusing) presentation to really stand out. Worth noting (and watching a video on the link ahead) is that that the bag shown above left and on the opener image is a tote bag made out of recycled cement bags that is half a body tall. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.moodley.at\/en\/portfolio\/branding\/verdarium.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">From North by Mikael Kivel&auml;<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_fromnorth.jpg\" alt=\"From North by Mikael Kivel&auml;\"\/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">This is an older project from 2010 and it seems that the client, From North, a jewelry brand and goldsmith factory in Finland does not exist anymore at its <a href=\"http:\/\/fromnorth.fi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">former domain<\/a>, replaced by something far less cool. Designed by Helsinki-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.behance.net\/KIVELA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mikael Kivel&auml;<\/a>, this identity feels forged out of some <em>Game of Thrones<\/em> kind of mythology with a badass medieval look to it: a castle sigil, a name that recalls the King of the North, the &#8220;heartborn&#8221; line that reads like &#8220;ironborn&#8221; (which is thrown around all the time on <em>GoT<\/em>). Anyway. There is a very interesting contrast of identity elements (shown above in blue) that don&#8217;t seem like any of them belong with each other, but they certainly do and with a lot of attitude and personality. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/From-North-Identity-2010\/8244655\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">No. Six Depot by Perky Bros<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_no6depot.jpg\" alt=\"No. Six Depot by Perky Bros\"\/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">Nashville, TN&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.perkybros.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Perky Bros<\/a> is back on Friday Likes with a quirky and highly sophisticated identity and packaging for <a href=\"http:\/\/sixdepot.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">No. Six Depot<\/a>, a roaster and caf&eacute; in West Stockbridge, MA. Vintage-illustration collages are paired with perfect typography all around, from the circle logo to the data on the labels. The gold, dark green, and light mint color palette is unexpected and looks quite tasty. A lot of thought and detail has clearly gone into this. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.perkybros.com\/portfolio\/sixdepot\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Today we are going to start with a couple of projects that might require some extra convincing on my part as they fall outside the obviously-cool spectrum and we will end things with a clear crowd pleaser with work from&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[571,419,564],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2775"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2775"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2775\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2775"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2775"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2775"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
