The &#8216;speech mark&#8217; will now appear as the central graphical focus overlaid on all marketing and marketing communications activity. The logo will also appear in a new 2D design in place of a skeuomorphic 3D approach.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.vodafone.com\/content\/index\/media\/vodafone-group-releases\/2017\/vodafone-announces-new-brand-positioning-strategy.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Vodafone press release<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/vodafone_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo for Vodafone by Brand Union\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/vodafone_icon.png\" alt=\"New Logo for Vodafone by Brand Union\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icon.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Since Vodafone is not in the U.S., this isn&#8217;t a brand I know well enough so my experience with it is limited to the few overseas travels in the last few years and what&#8217;s apparent is that Vodafone can appear to be <em>everywhere<\/em> and part of it is its striking speech-bubble mark that &#8212; regardless of whether it&#8217;s good or not &#8212; it makes a bold impression. Drenched in 3D renderings as it was before it definitely had impact &#8212; gaudy impact but impact nonetheless. It was improbable that Vodafone would change to something else altogether so this evolution is in tune with what the rest of the brands are doing, which is going flat.<\/p>\n<p>As usual, it looks better to designers&#8217; eyes but I wonder if this loses more equity and recognition than something like Audi or Movistar did when they shed their gradients and textures? The bevel effect was so strong in the old rendering that I think that was more recognizable than owning the color red (vs. T-Mobile&#8217;s magenta or Orange&#8217;s orange). With the speech mark all in red, it will take some time to build the same instant recognition the silver and red version had. This challenge is further compounded by the use of the speech mark as a stroke in the applications, but we&#8217;ll get to that in the next later.  The new wordmark is fine and, as a personal preference, way better than the old UPS- and FF Dax-like clunker.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/vodafone_sample_old.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Vodafone by Brand Union\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sample of old look.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>Vodafone&#8217;s brand positioning strategy focuses on the theme of optimism about the future, using the new strapline, &#8220;The future is exciting. Ready?&#8221;. The first part of the strapline will be presented in local languages with the second part &#8211; &#8220;Ready?&#8221; &#8211; presented in English. For example: &#8220;il futuro \u00e8 straordinario. Ready?&#8221; in Italian; and &#8220;El futuro es apasionante.

It created some odd layouts but it was an easy way of making applications consistent as well as establishing a recognizable graphic device. The new applications rely on a much more &#8220;fragile&#8221; graphic device which is a stroked version of the speech mark on its own. Removing the circle around it takes a way a lot of its visual presence.<\/p>\n<p>While the idea is sort of interesting, I think this lacks the impact necessary for the brand to scream as loud as it did in the past in order to compete out there in the world where it has to go head to head with all other major brands, not just of mobile providers but the Nikes and Apples of the world. There might be too much visual pressure on the stroked icon and I&#8217;m not sure it will be able to deliver.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/vodafone_powerpoint.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Vodafone by Brand Union\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sara Oliviera, Head of Brand and Media, Vodafone Group.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/vodafone_ghana_launch.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Vodafone by Brand Union\" \/>\n<figcaption>Launch in Ghana.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"hu\" dir=\"ltr\">Ami eddig csak j\u00e1t\u00e9k volt, az ma m\u00e1r leny\u0171g\u00f6z\u0151 \u00e9lm\u00e9ny: <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/twzwOZzeBN\">https:\/\/t.co\/twzwOZzeBN<\/a>.

The application directly above is a good example&#8230; it makes the speech mark look&#8230; mundane. Additionally As the image with the CCO and the image of the little girl with the robot (in the elevator) show, this identity could quickly suffer from bad Photoshop silhouetting and it could make the brand look really poorly, really quickly.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/1TqaxX5K8yg\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>&#8220;Hello&#8221; TV spot.
