Through a larger desktop router or a smaller mobile device users get access to some of the faster speeds available in London &mdash; billed as &#8220;fibre-fast&#8221; &mdash; thanks to its parent company, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ukbroadband.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">UK Broadband<\/a>, which is &#8220;the UK&#8217;s largest commercial holder of national radio spectrum suitable for 4G mobile services and fixed wireless solutions&#8221;.

A fairly straightforward slab serif with a round finish on the bottom right of each character. Could be better, could be worse. What really got my attention about this identity was the characters.<\/p>\n<blockquote>Turquoise chose to focus on the activities that high-volume data users &mdash; Productive People &mdash; need high-speed connections for on a daily basis. The identity has been created with a broad range of component illustrations, enabling it to stretch across all media and marketing touchpoints and communicate the many ways in which Relish empowers Productive People.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/priyamistry.co.uk\/portfolio\/project\/relish\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Priya Mistry project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/relish_character_running.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Relish by Turquoise Branding\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/relish_character_dancing.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Relish by Turquoise Branding\" \/>\n<figcaption>A couple of character animations.

There is something oddly appealing about them and when set in motion they come alive in a very endearing way. I am not convinced this is the best approach or concept for this product and there is no real visual relationship or graphic tie-in between the logo and the characters but, again, there is something innately attractive to the blunt cast of characters &mdash; they are almost like caveman drawings, if cavemen wanted to sell each other Wi-Fi services.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/96926529?portrait=0&amp;color=f0001c\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>New brand introduction.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/relish_packaging_render.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Relish by Turquoise Branding\" \/>\n<figcaption>&#8220;Pocket Hub&#8221; packaging for on-the-go connection.

There is a third element thrown around, a line-art rendition of the London skyline&#8217;s most popular landmarks, which has little visual tie-in to anything else but it does say &#8220;London&#8221;. Overall, the identity could have been tied together better but it&#8217;s a welcome change of pace in this spectrum.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Launched earlier this month and available exclusively in London, Relish is a new service that provides internet connectivity through 4G and wireless networks without the need to physically connect any wires to phone or cable lines.
