With the departure of the Montreal Expos to Washington, the Blue Jays are the sole Canadian team in the MLB. Last week, the Blue Jays announced new uniforms and a new logo for the 2012 season, designed by the MLB&#8217;s Design Services, that take them back to their original look<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bluejays_logo_old_comparison.gif\" alt=\"Toronto Blue Jays\" \/><\/p>\n<blockquote>The new look is a modernized version of the franchise&#8217;s first logo that was used from 1977-97. It features a sleeker-looking Blue Jay bird head with a prominent red maple leaf to showcase Toronto&#8217;s standing as the only Major League Baseball team in Canada.<br \/><br \/>The new look was more than 18 months in the making. It was created by the Blue Jays with assistance from the Design Services division of Major League Baseball, in conjunction with members of Toronto&#8217;s staff, manager John Farrell and several players.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/toronto.bluejays.mlb.com\/news\/article.jsp?ymd=20111117&#038;content_id=25996396&#038;vkey=news_tor&#038;c_id=tor\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press Release<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe width=\"574\" height=\"389\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/gkJP1budiAc\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Promo video for new logo.

So it&#8217;s nice to see a storied franchise go back to their roots and revive a well-known logo. Unfortunately the original logo wasn&#8217;t that good so the revival can only do so much. The logo looks like a plate of food served haphazardly, one thing on top of the other, with the maple leaf as garnish. The execution is better &mdash; from the blue jay itself to the chiseled serif type choice to the inline lettering &mdash; but the arrangement mostly remains awkward. Not terrible, just not great. The alternate logos and lettering options, on their own, look quite disconnected even if, again, they are sort of well done. There just seems to be a lack of cohesiveness and connection between icon and typography. Nonetheless, a welcome change to simpler things.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.looneyrooney.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Chris Rooney<\/a> for first tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_111123_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_111123_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_111123_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_111123_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,26,87],"tags":[230,409,150,604,556],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1734"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1734"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1734\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1734"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1734"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1734"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
