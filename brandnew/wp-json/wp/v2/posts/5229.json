Also works great in relation to the name- vibration, tension and rhythm in meaning of magnetism.&#8221; Something might be getting lost in translation but, yeah, I get it. I really dig the different, wonky &#8220;M&#8221;s and &#8220;MMMM&#8221; patterns and how they can adapt to different heights. The wordmark is okay and the overall typography could use some extra oomph but the general texture and dynamism created by the &#8220;M&#8221;s has a certain kind of&#8230; I don&#8217;t know&#8230; attractive magnetism. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/46782729\/Magneting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">The Garage Group by Hyperquake<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_thegaragegroup.jpg\" alt=\"The Garage Group by Hyperquake\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.thegaragegroup.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Garage Group<\/a> is an innovation and growth strategy firm in Cincinnati, OH, that, you guessed it, started its business in a garage. Originally a 2-person firm, it now has over a dozen employees <em>not<\/em> in a garage. The original logo already featured one of those classic, unfinished, unadorned light bulbs you find in creepy basements and garages with the little chain to turn on but as you&#8217;ll see on the project link, it was kind of crummy. The new logo by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hyperquake.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hyperquake<\/a> fixes the original concept beautifully with a rugged, industrial aesthetic that resolves into a bad-ass, badge-like logo. The wordmark is garage-y as well but doesn&#8217;t go full grunge to avoid scaring clients. The applications are okay but, to me, the highlight was the light bulb logo. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hyperquake.com\/work\/the-garage-group\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Fabric by Richards Partners<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_fabric.jpg\" alt=\"Fabric by Richards Partners\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/fabricofonehunga.co.nz\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fabric<\/a> is a residential development in Onehunga, a suburb of Auckland City in New Zealand with many industrial businesses setting up shop there. The development takes its name from the site&#8217;s previous life as a clothing factory. The identity by Newmarket, Auckland-based <a href=\"https:\/\/richards.partners\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Richards Partners<\/a> brings the name to life with &#8220;fabric&#8221; letters stitched together with hyphens. Each character in the alphabet is the width of &#8220;F-A-B-R-I-C&#8221; repeated vertically 14 times. The letters have a great texture small and when used big, as in the cover, it takes a minute to see the &#8220;F&#8221;, giving the identity two different feels and ways of showing of the letters. The applications are elegant and contemporary with crisp layouts and a simple color palette.  <a href=\"http:\/\/bpando.org\/2017\/02\/21\/branding-fabric-onehunga\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Some bold simplicity throughout the projects this week, with work from Bratislava, Cincinnati, and Newmarket&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[36,11,83,26],"tags":[1158,1368,711],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5229"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=5229"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5229\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=5229"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=5229"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=5229"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
