In Mexico the undisputed taste champion (at least in my personal tests) was Orange Crush and I guess the <a href=\"http:\/\/flickr.com\/photos\/64892387@N00\/192369250\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">funky glass bottle<\/a> it came in had something to do with the experience. A close second was Fanta. So, yes, that was an odd segue to bring us to the subject at hand, but I really wanted to link to the Orange Crush bottle. With more than 70 flavors (including mind-benders like Banana Fermented Milk, Mellon Vanilla and Mint Raspberry) in 180 markets around the world, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fanta.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fanta<\/a>, from the Coca-Cola family of products, will be implementing a new identity designed by San Francisco-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.visitoffice.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Office<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fanta_01.jpg\" alt=\"Fanta Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.virtualvender.coca-cola.com\/ft\/index.jsp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">official description of Fanta<\/a>, from Coca-Cola, will help put in context the work:<\/p>\n<blockquote>Available in Europe since the 1940s, Fanta was introduced in the United States in 1960. Consumers around the world, particularly teens, fondly associate Fanta with happiness and special times with friends and family. This positive imagery is driven by the brand&#8217;s fun, playful personality, which goes hand in hand with its bright color, bold fruit taste and tingly carbonation.<\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fanta_03.jpg\" alt=\"Fanta Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fanta_04.jpg\" alt=\"Fanta Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fanta_06.jpg\" alt=\"Fanta Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>New identity elements by Office.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>As explained on their web site (<em>Work > Fanta<\/em>) Office developed a flexible range of branding elements &mdash; in the form of a visual vocabulary of playful illustrations, shapes and colors &mdash; that can then be put together in a variety of different ways according to each locale&#8217;s message, audience and the flavors available. As well, an evolution of the logo has been introduced.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fanta_old_bottles.jpg\" alt=\"Fanta Old Bottles\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fanta_old_cans.jpg\" alt=\"Fanta Old Cans\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Current bottle and can design.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The old and current look of Fanta fits right in the soda market. It&#8217;s colorful, bold, and busy, relying heavily on swirls and eye-of-the-storm backgrounds to capture the attention. In contrast, the new identity is more cohesive, more evident about what it&#8217;s selling (oranges!) and, most importantly, it&#8217;s more varied, diverse and versatile. And the new cans, which may or may not be the final product, look pretty damn fantastic.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fanta_02.jpg\" alt=\"Fanta Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Can designs by Office.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fanta_bottles.jpg\" alt=\"Fanta Bottles\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Bottle designs taken from Poland&#8217;s Fanta web site.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fanta_new_single_can.jpg\" alt=\"Fanta Bottles\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Not quite sure where this is from, but it does show what happens when good elements are paired with bad elements.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The new identity hasn&#8217;t been rolled out in the U.S. yet, but it has started to appear in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fanta.pl\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Europe<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fanta.ru\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Russia<\/a>.
