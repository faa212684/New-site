Five to six minutes of your help to be specific. We would very much like to know what you do, how you do it and how much or how little you read Brand New and the rest of the UnderConsideration sites by completing our <a href=\"http:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/survey2007\/uc_survey_bn.html\">2007 Survey: <em>It&#8217;s not me, it&#8217;s you<\/em><\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>We are currently in the midst of an energized push to look for supporters (advertisers, sponsors, printers and other enterprises) that will enable us to keep doing what we are doing and, what&#8217;s better, allow us to do more of it and through different venues. Knowing who our audience is is not only eye-opening for us, it allows us to target the most relevant candidates that will be interested in supporting our community. Finding appropriate supporters is essential to the continued progress of UnderConsideration: Server power and storage, self-funded publications that we can offer at minimal cost, programing and coding upgrades to our sites, and a myriad of other ideas are all waiting patiently to be fulfilled.
