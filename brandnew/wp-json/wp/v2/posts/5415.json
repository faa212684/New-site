The new Nordic Swan has a more modern and more functional digital design. [&hellip;] One of the reform&#8217;s objectives are to clarify which organizations are part of the official Nordic cooperation &#8211; the future is the new swan label common to all of them. At the same time allows for the visual solution to the difference between the Nordic Council &#8211; Nordic parliamentary cooperation body, and the Nordic Council of Ministers, the Nordic governments, clarified.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.norden.org\/en\/news-and-events\/news\/en-ny-svan-aer-foedd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nordic Co-operation press release<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/norden_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Nordic Co-operation by Kontrapunkt\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icon.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo had the right idea &#8212; so much so that it was a great base for the new logo &#8212; but the detailed execution worked against it because of those thin lines in the wings of the swan that didn&#8217;t reduce very kindly. The old wordmark was atrocious. I would have probably posted this as a Noted but the new icon is so perfectly done that it deserves some extra attention. Few logos designed today are as classically done as this. It&#8217;s so tight and well done it doesn&#8217;t even need an underlying grid to explain anything&#8230; it just works. Also note the ink traps of where the wing meets the body of the swan. Boss. I do expect comparisons to the Lufthansa logo in the comments but this is far from a copy of it and it builds on the basic structure of the previous version.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/norden_logo_main.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Nordic Co-operation by Kontrapunkt\" \/>\n<figcaption>Main three logos.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/norden_logo_extensions.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Nordic Co-operation by Kontrapunkt\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sub-brands.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>I still don&#8217;t really understand what all the different Nordic This and Nordic That are or how exactly the organization is structured and who does what but they clearly have a lot of sub-brands. The geometric sans serif is safe and bland but it does its job properly in attaching itself to the icon. I love how the baseline of the wordmarks aligns with the body of the swan in the icon.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/norden_materials.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Nordic Co-operation by Kontrapunkt\" \/>\n<figcaption>Various covers.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/norden_folder.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Nordic Co-operation by Kontrapunkt\" \/>\n<figcaption>Meeting materials.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/norden_flag.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Nordic Co-operation by Kontrapunkt\" \/>\n<figcaption>Flag.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/norden_flag_2.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Nordic Co-operation by Kontrapunkt\" \/>\n<figcaption>Flag, cooler shot.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">Not much in application but everything is crisp and clean.
