While the workings under the hood of <a href=\"http:\/\/news.cnet.com\/8301-13953_3-9974373-80.html?hhTest=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the new web site<\/a> like a &#8220;new API that is helping to deliver pages 40 to 50 percent faster&#8221; means nothing to me, we can certainly focus on the front-end changes, specifically the logo. Originally named and written c\/net (for Computer Network) it is now an all caps CNET, making the logo in all lowercase a little contradicting, but who can argue against the friendliness of lowercase? The new logo is being referred to as the &#8220;pipeless&#8221; logo, <strike>so I&#8217;m guessing that the vertical line in the old one was meant to signify a, um, pipe &mdash; but like no one should call New York &#8220;The Big Apple&#8221; I&#8217;m going out on a limb and say that no one refers to the internet delivery system as a &#8220;Pipe&#8221;. But I digress.<\/strike> [<em>Update: See Patrick Foster&#8217;s comment<\/em>]. The typography in the old logo was peculiar and quirky, with the weird &#8220;n&#8221; and tight letterspacing making it somewhat engaging and memorable, while the new one is painfully generic and forgettable. And while everybody knows that this is pronounced see-net, the lack of a visual divider certainly renders the new logo as knet. Oh, yes, it now has a shadow to make it look like a sphere. Yay.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Thanks to Moeed Mohammad, Fred Sotherland and Greg for the tip.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,26,88],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/664"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=664"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/664\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=664"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=664"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=664"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
