Designed by local firm, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sulliwan.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sulliwan<\/a>, the resulting logos look diagrammatically fun, if that&#8217;s even a proper adjective. The royal blue color and blunt sans serif give it a trendy feel yet the application is as clean and spare as any corporation. A very nice balance overall. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/16373595\/Public-Space\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Veganise! by Zuzanna Rogatty<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_veganize.jpg\" alt=\"Veganise! by Zuzanna Rogatty\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">Now, here is a thing you probably didn&#8217;t think would exist: a &#8220;fashion brand for vegan food and lifestyle lovers&#8221;. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/veganisenet\/photos_stream\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Veganise!<\/a> is a retail effort by Poznan, Poland-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.behance.net\/rogatty\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Zuzanna Rogatty<\/a> that sells t-shirts with a giant &#8220;tofu!&#8221; slogan on it or a &#8220;go vegan&#8221; proclamation, all designed in a wonderful, hard-edged, monoweight script and matching custom sans serif. It&#8217;s playful, hip, and fresh like a wheatgrass shot. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/15932105\/Veganise-\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project here<\/strong><\/a><\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">La Central by Estudio Yey&eacute;<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_lacentral.jpg\" alt=\"La Central by Estudio Yey&eacute;\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">Of all 88 Friday Likes, this project is probably my favorite, or at least top three. Designed by Mexican design firm <a href=\"http:\/\/estudioyeye.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Estudio Yey&eacute;<\/a> for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Lacentralfabricadepanycafe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">La Central<\/a>, a bakery and cafe in Chihuahua, the identity is non-stop awesome. From the custom chiseled logo, to the badges, to the complex illustration (and the way elements from that illustration can be taken apart), to the sticky and rubber stamps, to the coffee packaging it&#8217;s all working on so many levels. Add to that killer sign painting for the restaurant and this is just hard to beat. Amazing. <a href=\"http:\/\/estudioyeye.com\/La-Central\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"What do grumpy cat, tofu, and a red-painted toy soldier have in common?
