Recently Ville de Nevers introduced a new identity designed by Paris- and Lyon-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.grapheine.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Graph\u00e9ine<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>Nevers is a city rich in history and heritage. Yet, like many medium-sized cities, its demography is on the decline, leading to the inevitable economic slowdown. Nevers is often described as &#8220;sleeping beauty&#8221; and it is precisely this image that we have sought to change. In this context, choosing a new visual identity is choosing <strong>to assert an ambition<\/strong>! To give back the departmental, regional and national stature that Nevers deserves. This new identity is therefore there to inscribe the city in <strong>modernity, movement and energy<\/strong>.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.grapheine.com\/en\/portfolio\/visual-identity-city-of-nevers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Graph\u00e9ine project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ville_de_nevers_logo_source.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Ville de Nevers by Graph\u00e9ine\" \/>\n<figcaption>Source of the chevrons: The Ducal Palace, previously the subject of the old logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The logo is designed in a modular way. In its initial configuration it draws the letter &#8220;N&#8221;, but it can be recomposed in a thousand ways&#8230; The idea of movement is written into his DNA. These arrows seem to open up as if to unfold the city&#8217;s potential.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.grapheine.com\/en\/portfolio\/visual-identity-city-of-nevers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Graph\u00e9ine project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ville_de_nevers_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Ville de Nevers by Graph\u00e9ine\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo was quite sad, with a terrible illustration of the Ducal Palace that looked as if Clifford the Big Red Dog peed on it and the typography was, well, it was not good. The new logo abstracts the distinctive polygon turrets of the building into chevrons that are then reconfigured to form an &#8220;N&#8221; in their counterspace. The resulting monogram is contemporary and surprising &#8212; eschewing the more typical let&#8217;s-make-our-quaint-city-look-quaint approach. The mix of solid chevrons with dotted chevrons creates an interesting sense of dimensionality as if the logo had two sources of light, casting different shadows. The wordmark does a good job in echoing the light\/dark composition of the monogram with a small light &#8220;Ville de&#8221; and a bold, all uppercase &#8220;NEVERS&#8221;. We just need to move that &#8220;S&#8221; a little bit to the left and we&#8217;ll be all set.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ville_de_nevers_logo_animation.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Ville de Nevers by Graph\u00e9ine\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo animation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ville_de_nevers_pattern_animation.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Ville de Nevers by Graph\u00e9ine\" \/>\n<figcaption>Pattern animation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The monogram&#8217;s animations are entertaining but if I had one philosophical question it would be what, if anything, do these animations tell us about Nevers? Of course, I know they are not meant to tell the story of the city, but this type of animation seems more appropriate for some kind of industrial corporation or tech-forward city, which doesn&#8217;t seem to be entirely the case here. Still, I spent more billable hours staring at those two GIFs than I should have.<\/p>\n<blockquote>The chevrons, as the main ingredients of the identity, are used in a lively and colourful way.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.grapheine.com\/en\/portfolio\/visual-identity-city-of-nevers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Graph\u00e9ine project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ville_de_nevers_logo_with_arrows.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Ville de Nevers by Graph\u00e9ine\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo with arrows.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ville_de_nevers_color_palette.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Ville de Nevers by Graph\u00e9ine\" \/>\n<figcaption>Color palette.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ville_de_nevers_stationery.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Ville de Nevers by Graph\u00e9ine\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stationery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The angle of the logo is the starting point of the composition of the posters. Large diagonals cross the format to draw rhythms through the posters. Colours, texts and images produce structured and moving compositions. The system can be put in minor to give prominence to the visual, or express itself fully when the iconography is deficient.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.grapheine.com\/en\/portfolio\/visual-identity-city-of-nevers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Graph\u00e9ine project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ville_de_nevers_layout_grid_a.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Ville de Nevers by Graph\u00e9ine\" \/>\n<figcaption>Layout variations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ville_de_nevers_sheets_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Ville de Nevers by Graph\u00e9ine\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ville_de_nevers_sheets_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Ville de Nevers by Graph\u00e9ine\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ville_de_nevers_sheets_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Ville de Nevers by Graph\u00e9ine\" \/>\n<figcaption>Posters.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ville_de_nevers_covers.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Ville de Nevers by Graph\u00e9ine\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ville_de_nevers_guide.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Ville de Nevers by Graph\u00e9ine\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sample covers.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The extension of the angled nature of the chevrons is nicely done in the applications, setting up a flexible system that&#8217;s dynamic, colorful, and engaging.

As a disclaimer, I have never been to Ville de Nevers but judging from the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=nevers+france&#038;safe=active&#038;source=lnms&#038;tbm=isch&#038;sa=X&#038;ved=0ahUKEwiEnv3ijvbbAhVk04MKHRfcDHkQ_AUIDCgD&#038;biw=1429&#038;bih=869\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google Image search<\/a>, the identity seems way too cool for what looks like an&#8230; old town. With some destinations that I&#8217;ve never been to, the Google Image Search result test does match what an identity is doing and I know it&#8217;s far from scientific but it seems like a disconnect in this case. Optimistically though, this very well-crafted identity could help set the tone for a cooler Ville de Nevers.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Ville de Nevers is the prefecture of the Ni\u00e8vre department in the Bourgogne-Franche-Comt\u00e9 region in central France.
