The series and format have now been exported to more than 35 countries including Bangladesh, China, France, Peru &mdash; to name but a few &mdash; and including Australia, where it&#8217;s consistently been the most watched series and in the United States, where celebrity chef Gordon Ramsey is judge. The format has evolved into &#8220;MasterChef: The Professionals&#8221; for professional working chefs, &#8220;Celebrity MasterChef&#8221; for celebrities that cook, and even &#8220;Junior MasterChef&#8221; for the kids. The MasterChef brand has evolved into a line of cooking consumer products, cookbooks, and magazines. To bring it all together, a new identity has been designed by London-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theplant.co.uk\/projects\/masterchef\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Plant<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/masterchef_01.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for MasterChef by The Plant\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/masterchef_01_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for MasterChef by The Plant\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail, texture and single color.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"http:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/69087560?portrait=0&amp;color=f0001c\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo animation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/masterchef_02.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for MasterChef by The Plant\" \/>\n<figcaption>Color variations<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo wasn&#8217;t so bad that it called attention to itself and screamed for a redesign but now that we see a better version it&#8217;s easier to spot the annoyance of the old one, like the poor and extra tightly tracked typography with its bad embossing as well as the undefined curves of the &#8220;m&#8221; in the monogram. The new logo has a much more readable and pleasant sans serif without the fiery effects while the &#8220;m&#8221; made out of the stove coil is cleaner and better spaced.

That&#8217;s not saying that it&#8217;s bad or boring or unimaginative. It&#8217;s all a fairly decent and clean approach that looks good but it&#8217;s nothing revolutionary.
