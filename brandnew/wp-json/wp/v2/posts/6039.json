While the logo could also be perfect for a martini house &#8212; since the elements of the logo look like olives &#8212; I really like its geometry and how its simplicity is given so much dynamism simply by moving around the inner dot. It also serves as a strong cornerstone for the patterned applications where it&#8217;s paired with a grid of dots and blown up versions of the company&#8217;s name in Chinese characters, all in a lovely tea-esque color palette. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/58689857\/Teaspira\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Maldini Studios by Jens Nilsson<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_maldini.jpg\" alt=\"Maldini Studios by Jens Nilsson\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.maldinistudios.se\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Maldini Studios<\/a> is an interior design and carpentry company in Stockholm with some lovely, unique work that is aptly represented in their new identity designed by local designer <a href=\"https:\/\/jens-nilsson.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jens Nilsson<\/a>, with a logo that looks almost as it it was carved out of wood with an axe. (Normally, that wouldn&#8217;t be a compliment to a logo but the choppy letterforms have a great feeling of craft to them.) The wordmark is complemented with a script for &#8220;Studios&#8221; that gives it a little jazz and, like Teaspira above, it is all executed in a super nice, earthy color palette and great choices of colored paper. Bonus points for the killer soccer scarf rendition. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/jens-nilsson.com\/projects\/maldini-studios\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Good Measure Co by Peter Craggs<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_goodmeasure.jpg\" alt=\"Good Measure Co by Peter Craggs\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/goodmeasureco.com.au\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Good Measure Co<\/a> is a new Australian chocolate brand offering artisan chocolates with the option of same-day delivery in Sydney (and normal shipping across Australia) delivered in unique boxes. The company was started by Peter Craggs and his wife Hannah, with the identity designed by Craggs himself, who has worked for various design firms in London and Sydney, including Wolff Olins, Re Sydney, Landor, Interbrand, SomeOne, and Venture Three. The chocolates come in an array of lovely boxes foiled with charming patterns and punctuated by a white label that can be customized with each customer&#8217;s message, making the box feel extra personalized &#8212; versus the typical printed note inside box, typeset in Times Roman. The balance of all the elements is just right, with the message in a light serif big and crisp and some supporting sans serif underneath hovering over the large patterns. The chocolates themselves are not bad-looking either. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/56461697\/Good-Measure-Co\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Some nice color combinations and patterning this week, with work from Beijing, Stockholm, and Sydney&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[51,11,85,26],"tags":[882,204,710],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6039"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=6039"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6039\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=6039"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=6039"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=6039"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
