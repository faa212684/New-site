Avnet employs over 15,000 people in 125 countries around the world and they have a kick-ass <a href=\"https:\/\/www.avnet.com\/wps\/portal\/us\/products\/product-highlights\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">inventory<\/a> of products for tinkerers. This week, Avnet introduced a new identity designed by New York, NY-based <a href=\"http:\/\/red-peak.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">RedPeak<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/avnet_old_look.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Avnet by Red Peak\" \/>\n<figcaption>Old look.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>Highlighting its ongoing mission to help customers navigate an ever-changing technology landscape, Avnet today introduced &#8220;Reach Further,&#8221; its new global branding campaign. [&hellip;] Reach Further is the result of deep research on Avnet&#8217;s key stakeholder audiences and aligns with the company&#8217;s business strategy. Avnet&#8217;s new logo replaces red with green to symbolize growth and possibility. The global campaign reflects the largest investment that Avnet has made in a marketing campaign during its 96-year history.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20170403005471\/en\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Avnet press release<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/8Z7rNc9F590\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>New logo introduction.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>Avnet is a guide for their customers &#8211; helping navigate elaborate supply-chains and global vendors. The &#8220;A&#8221; was designed to show focus and direction &#8211; a path forward. We also changed from a red to green color palette to convey optimism and growth. The horizontal green bar at the bottom of the mark was inspired by the cursor from early computer screens, and our font Aper\u00e7u Mono was also picked for it&#8217;s resemblance to programming code.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/red-peak.com\/work\/avnet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">RedPeak project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/avnet_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Avnet by Red Peak\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo with tagline.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/avnet_brand_architecture.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Avnet by Red Peak\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brand architecture.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo had an old school corporate charm with its vintage-AT&amp;T-esque use of lines to differentiate between weights and create an interesting interplay in the monogram. The wordmark could have been left alone, without the stenciling. Its main problem was that it felt monolithic, cold, and not like a company that would encourage collaboration. The new logo maintains some of the seriousness of the old one but feels so much more like a collaborative enterprise focused on technology. The &#8220;A&#8221; makes for a good visual hook into the logo and its own airiness sets the tone for the rest of the generous letterspacing, making it feel, literally, open and welcoming. Maybe it&#8217;s something RedPeak tried in the process but I wonder how the rest of the letters would have looked like with the same treatment as the &#8220;A&#8221;, bringing in that stencil structure from the previous logo. Not that that would make it a better or worse logo, just wondering out loud. The logo extends well into sub-brands and pairs nicely with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.colophon-foundry.org\/typefaces\/apercu\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Aper\u00e7u Mono<\/a>.<\/p>\n<blockquote>In addition, Avnet is introducing its &#8220;A-Frame,&#8221; a new graphic element to build brand recognition that represents the company&#8217;s dedication to progress and collaboration and is used to highlight or frame important moments.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20170403005471\/en\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Avnet press release<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/avnet_diagonals_words.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Avnet by Red Peak\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/avnet_diagonals_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Avnet by Red Peak\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/avnet_diagonals_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Avnet by Red Peak\" \/>\n<figcaption>&#8220;A-Frame&#8221; device.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>This is a nice extension of the &#8220;A&#8221; into a recurring visual device for the identity. Not as striking, but it reminds me a little of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wolffolins.com\/work\/37\/red\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">(RED) brand by Wolff Olins<\/a>, with their parentheses able to wrap around anything and still be recognizable as (RED). Certainly, Avnet lacks some Bono and other mainstream brand power but the green diagonals are a good graphic effort to give Avnet a tool to build an identity around.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/avnet_icons.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Avnet by Red Peak\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icons.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/avnet_icons_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Avnet by Red Peak\" \/>\n<figcaption>Diagrams.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Nice icons, although I keep trying to see &#8220;A&#8221; diagonals in the lines that are highlighted in a different color&#8230; doesn&#8217;t seem to be a clear rhythm or pattern to them. Still, nice enough.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/avnet_business_cards.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Avnet by Red Peak\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/avnet_loose_sheets.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Avnet by Red Peak\" \/>\n<figcaption>Loose sheets of some kind.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/avnet_posters.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Avnet by Red Peak\" \/>\n<figcaption>Posters.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/avnet_packaging.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Avnet by Red Peak\" \/>\n<figcaption>Packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">The applications are all solid with a good balance of white space, splashes of green, and repetition of the angle of the &#8220;A&#8221; as in the packaging or the bottom boxes of the loose sheets. The photography could use some kind of point of view&#8230; as it&#8217;s all over the place, showing a satellite in space, a dude at a desk, and a dog chasing a drone all in different styles. I would recommend a Spotify duotone-ing approach so that then I could complain how it looks like a Spotify duotone approach. Anyway&#8230; a rather nice corporate redesign that makes a somewhat unknown company ready for broader consumer acceptance.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1921, Avnet helps other companies or individuals take a product from concept to completion&#8230; to distribution to maintenance and support at a large scale, from baby monitors to pollution sensors installed on the light poles across Sao Paulo&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,36,26],"tags":[936,319,1395,1381],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5369"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=5369"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5369\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=5369"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=5369"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=5369"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
