Its mission is to &#8220;give [people] the tools to thrive in a new country&#8221; and was built by a diverse team that had spent the last two decades serving global migrant communities within the fintech, payments, and telecom spaces. Founded in Stockholm, Sweden, Majority launched in the U.S. with headquarters in Houston, TX, and a partnership with Sutton Bank, Member FDIC, with the goal of expanding to other states in the U.S.. The identity for Majority has been designed by Stockholm-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.boldscandinavia.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bold<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>The brand and visual identity were built around Majority&#8217;s principle of inclusivity. We&#8217;ve translated the name Majority into a graphic device, called the Canvas. The canvas is a geometric grid, inspired by flag designs. It can be brought to life through use of colours, photography, animation and typography. It&#8217;s an endlessly diverse, unifying design system that ties together the whole brand experience; from an intuitive banking app, to modular retail spaces and to playful campaign materials.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.boldscandinavia.com\/work\/majority\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bold project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/majority_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Majority by Bold\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\" style=\"padding-bottom: 74.25%;\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/majority_logo_animation.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo animation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>There is not much to the new logo. A bold, uppercase sans serif with an extended structure. It could be an airline, it could be a gallery, it could be a fashion label, it could be a number of things but it happens to be an app-based banking account. Is it good? Not really. Is it bad? Not really. I think the goal of the logo is to simply establish some trust as a kind of neutral entity that, most importantly, doesn&#8217;t look like a traditional bank but that instead looks like something one might find in cooler retail establishments. For the record, visually and technically, the logo is absolutely fine &#8212; nice font, well spaced, etc. I also have the feeling that the &#8220;canvas&#8221; graphic below was pitched as the main logo but was a little too wild for a U.S.-based audience.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/majority_wordmark_to_canvas.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Majority by Bold\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo-to-&#8220;canvas&#8221; concept.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/majority_canvas.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Majority by Bold\" \/>\n<figcaption>The canvas.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\" style=\"padding-bottom: 74.25%;\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/majority_wordmark_animation.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Canvas animation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>This is where things start to get interesting. I really like how the foundation for this &#8220;canvas&#8221; graphic came from a close-up of the &#8220;M&#8221;, which then led to heavy abstractions of each letter in the name, which <em>then<\/em> led to this cool tapestry of shapes that are used throughout the identity. At first glance its geometric gobbledygook, but the letters are quite readable with some effort (and if you know what it&#8217;s supposed to spell beforehand), so it has the benefit of looking cool on its own but it&#8217;s also not gratuitous shapes. And it animates like a boss.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\" style=\"padding-bottom: 74.25%;\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/majority_typography.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Typography.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/majority_photography.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Majority by Bold\" \/>\n<figcaption>Photography.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/majority_layout_system.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Majority by Bold\" \/>\n<figcaption>Layout system.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/majority_visual_language_01.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Majority by Bold\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/majority_visual_language_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Majority by Bold\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/majority_visual_language_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Majority by Bold\" \/>\n<figcaption>Visual language.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/majority_advertising_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Majority by Bold\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/majority_advertising_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Majority by Bold\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/majority_advertising_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Majority by Bold\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/majority_wildposting.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Majority by Bold\" \/>\n<figcaption>Out of home advertising and wild postings.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The identity comes together in explosive ways, with very energetic and bold applications that mix the canvas shapes with lots of color, great photography, and the introduction of a condensed sans serif that nicely contrasts the wide wordmark. To be honest, I&#8217;m not sure this says &#8220;We are a finance app&#8221; but, from an optimistic point of view, I think what it does is establish a culturally rich and diverse persona that feels more human, raw, and accepting that is much more appealing and engaging than a more buttoned-up, finance-y approach ever could. I do feel like somewhere in all of the above it should be a little more clear exactly what &#8220;Majority&#8221; is because it could easily be mistaken for a music festival. Still, it&#8217;s nice to see an identity in the finance realm go more over the top in its applications.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\" style=\"padding-bottom: 67.25%;\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/majority_digital_billboard.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Digital ad.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/majority_instagram_stories.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Instagram stories.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/majority_app_icon.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Majority by Bold\" \/>\n<figcaption>App icon.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/majority_app_ui_design.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Majority by Bold\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/majority_app_ui_design_animated.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>App UI.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/majority_tote.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Majority by Bold\" \/>\n<figcaption>Tote.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/majority_beanie.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Majority by Bold\" \/>\n<figcaption>Beanie.
