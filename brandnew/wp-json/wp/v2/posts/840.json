As with other management changes, this lead to the redesign of Spanair&#8217;s identity. The job went to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.morillas.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Morillas Brand Design<\/a>, who led Spanair to two very viable solutions for a new logo. The obvious next step &mdash; sarcasm! &mdash; was to put those two identity options to public voting. Between May 5 and 11, close to 80,000 people voted and mid-May, the winner was announced.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/spanair_options.gif\" alt=\"Spanair Logo Options\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>The two contenders.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/spanair_runner-up.gif\" alt=\"Spanair Logo, the Runner-up\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>The runner-up.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The presented options were the winning design, titled &#8220;World,&#8221; and the runner-up, titled &#8220;Trail&#8221; or &#8220;Wake.&#8221; &#8220;Mundo&#8221; y &#8220;Estela&#8221; in Spanish. Both logos had a feeling of space flight more than regular commuter flight, which I guess is a nice aspirational inclination. The runner-up would have been a pain to reproduce, with such a thin mark and it was the more NASAesque. The winner, well, there isn&#8217;t much nice to say about it other than it&#8217;s a visual improvement over the previous one. But it seems to be a derivative of too many logos. I&#8217;m not one to typically make logo equations, but this one is too easy to resist:<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/spanair_equation.gif\" alt=\"Spanair Logo, Equation\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Boeing + Pepsi + Expedia = Spanair<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Below are two opinion pieces on each of the options.<\/strong><\/span>\n <br \/>\n<object width=\"480\" height=\"295\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/g-fclPg4q-I&#038;hl=en&#038;fs=1\"><\/param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"><\/param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"><\/param><embed src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/g-fclPg4q-I&#038;hl=en&#038;fs=1\" type=\"application\/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"480\" height=\"295\"><\/embed><\/object><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>About &#8220;World.&#8221;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><object width=\"480\" height=\"295\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/C44emhQh4ts&#038;hl=en&#038;fs=1\"><\/param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"><\/param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"><\/param><embed src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/C44emhQh4ts&#038;hl=en&#038;fs=1\" type=\"application\/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"480\" height=\"295\"><\/embed><\/object><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>About &#8220;Trail.&#8221;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hollisduncan.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hollis Duncan<\/a> for the tip.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[60,9,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/840"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=840"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/840\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=840"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=840"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=840"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
