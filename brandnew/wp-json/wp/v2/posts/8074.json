With a new showroom opening in Helsinki, Finland, Nomart introduced a new identity designed by local firm <a href=\"https:\/\/kuudes.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kuudes<\/a>. The logo features a loopy &#8220;n&#8221; that is meant to reference mid-century Scandinavian design and although I am not sure (through my own lack of awareness of mid-century Scandinavian design) how that translates I simply like it for its quirkiness. Also, if you have read Brand New for some time you know I hate unicase but this works so well. Not crazy about the &#8220;R&#8221; as it distracts from the &#8220;n&#8221;. The applications are quite great, with a lot of copper printing and finishing that works beautifully with the dark blue and tan color palette. All together, the identity looks as expensive as I am sure the cheapest piece of furniture is in their collection (which is to say still pretty expensive). <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/kuudes.com\/work\/nomart\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Newport Coffee House by Abe Zieleniec<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_newportcoffee.jpg\" alt=\"Newport Coffee House by Abe Zieleniec\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.newport-coffee.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Newport Coffee House<\/a> is a coffee roaster and coffee shop with two locations north of Chicago, one in Evanston, IL, and the other in Bannockburn, IL (where the roastery is). Their identity, designed by Chicago-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.abezieleniec.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Abe Zieleniec<\/a>, builds around a great icon-slash-monogram that doubles as a coffee mug and an &#8220;NP&#8221; combination that is all kinds of pleasing. Accompanied by crisp sans and serif typography, the icon and wordmark deploy effortlessly on all applications, from signage to apron to mug, where the icon adds another mug for some mug on mug action. The only glitch and this is more of a Public Service Announcement than an attempt at derailing this beautiful job is to always make sure you use an apostrophe, not a single quote mark, when contracting years &#8212; it should be &rsquo;92 not &lsquo;92. Aside from that, which most people won&#8217;t notice, this is super spiffy. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.abezieleniec.com\/project\/newport-coffee\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Letta Botr\u00e1gyi by Peltan-Brosz Studio<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_letta.jpg\" alt=\"Letta Botr\u00e1gyi by Peltan-Brosz Studio\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/lettabotragyi\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Letta Botr\u00e1gyi<\/a> is a fashion designer in Budapest, Hungary, specializing in couture wedding gowns. Her identity, designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/peltan-brosz.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Peltan-Brosz Studio<\/a>, is elegant, you guessed it, AF, with a lovely condensed, thin, high-contrast wordmark that doesn&#8217;t need much else to shine. The print applications, most of them embossed on pearlescent paper, are all swoon-worthy for brides (and grooms) to be. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/86140221\/Letta\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Some elegant and effective wordmarks (and monograms) make this week&apos;s projects quite enjoyable, with work from Helsinki, Chicago, and Budapest&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[68,11,85,86,26],"tags":[597,1660,755],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8074"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=8074"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8074\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=8074"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=8074"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=8074"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
