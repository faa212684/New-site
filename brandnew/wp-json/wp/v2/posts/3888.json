The product is available in Sweden and produced by Food for Progress Scandinavia AB, an organization developing sustainable food options.

I also enjoy that not every flavor variety is the exact same layout structure as you see in most packaging systems but instead the bursts of type and information adapt to the names of the flavors and the contours of the photography. If I saw this in the frozen food section of my grocery story I would totally go for it. (Then I might realize it&#8217;s soy protein and remember why I love a good steak.)<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Launched this year, Oumph! is a new line of ready-to-cook vegetarian meals made from soy protein concocted to feel and taste like meat, available in strips or chunks and in a number of seasonings.
