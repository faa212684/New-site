Smith was launched in the US in 2008 and in 2011 the American corporation purchased the UK parent company and in order to establish a consistent global brand, Smith introduced a new identity in November, designed by San Francisco, CA-based <a href=\"http:\/\/strohlsf.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Strohl<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/smith_vehicles_07.jpg\" alt=\"Smith Electric Vehicles\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">One of the original &#8220;milk floats&#8221; from the 1940s-50s (shown repurposed as a food truck).<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/smith_vehicles_02.jpg\" alt=\"Smith Electric Vehicles\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/smith_vehicles_03.jpg\" alt=\"Smith Electric Vehicles\" \/><\/p>\n<blockquote>The resulting brandmark, a winged tiger, communicates the core values of the company: innovation, impact and unity, and reflects the company&#8217;s 80 year heritage and passion of its employees.<br \/><br \/>The tiger has long been a symbol of power and agility&#8211;attributes at the core of Smith&#8217;s business. It is an extremely energy efficient creature, and can quickly access an extraordinary amount of power, using it in a calculated and efficient manner. The addition of wings to the tiger adds an aspirational&#8211;almost mythical&#8211;aspect to the mark, underscoring the concept of balance in nature.<br \/><br \/>The orange color was carried over from the previous brand&#8211;maintaining continuity and differentiation for Smith amongst the &#8220;green-washed&#8221; world of sustainable branding. The typography is bold with strong that are implemented elsewhere as part of a larger graphic system.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/strohlsf.com\/smith-electric-vehicles-2\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Strohl Case Study<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/smith_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"Smith Electric Vehicles\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/smith_vehicles_01.jpg\" alt=\"Smith Electric Vehicles\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The previous logo was a decent effort despite a slightly confused &#8220;S&#8221; monogram and a lowercase &#8220;m&#8221; where an uppercase one should have been. In contrast to the new one, however, it&#8217;s amazing how uninspiring and generic it was. I love the simplicity and boldness of the new icon, it feels strong and confident, and it gives Smith a story to tell. I am a sucker for bold strokes and this winged tiger is captured successfully with a minimal amount of vector points. The typography, matching the thickness of the stroke, works perfectly in unison with the icon and has just the right amount of customization in the &#8220;S&#8221; and its angles to make it particular to Smith. In application, whether on the business card or the side of a truck, the logo, type, and color serve as a strong identifier that doesn&#8217;t rely on &#8220;green&#8221; clich&eacute;s focusing instead, as it should, on the strength and values of the product and company.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/smith_vehicles_04.jpg\" alt=\"Smith Electric Vehicles\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/smith_vehicles_05.jpg\" alt=\"Smith Electric Vehicles\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Sub-branding for proprietary technologies within the truck (battery, drive train, software\/diagnostics).<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/smith_vehicles_06.jpg\" alt=\"Smith Electric Vehicles\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">President Obama visiting the Smith Kansas City plant in 2010.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_120213_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_120213_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_120213_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_120213_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,26,90],"tags":[230,41,42,687],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1834"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1834"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1834\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1834"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1834"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1834"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
