It is responsible for the promotion of the sport, including running, jumping, throwing, and walking; the organization of competitions, from track and field, road running, cross country running, to race walking; and the management of the French National team in international competitions. This past July the organization changed its name to Athl\u00e9 and introduced a new identity designed by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dragonrouge.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dragon Rouge<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>The new logo is directly related to the origins of our sport and Olympism.

Other than dramatically-arched rooster, everything was generic and sort of random in the old logo, including the purple color &#8212; a mix of France&#8217;s blue and red I presume? The new logo is a drastic departure not just for the organization but for logos in general. As I write this I&#8217;m still unclear in my feelings about it. I want to like it but there is something unbalanced about it and very weird about it, even when its purpose is to clearly be weird. I think it might be the heavy &#8220;e&#8221; at the end. Or it could be the centerpiece &#8220;H&#8221; and its slightly angled stems. Perhaps there is something lost in translation, but the rationalizations make no sense; I could see perhaps this new logo referencing Greek letterforms but all the other references are lost. It&#8217;s daring for sure. The variation with the partner logos is cool in principle but very odd-looking in execution.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure about the name either but I will differ to our French-speaking readers to comment on that. It seems like an unfinished thought or as if, say, the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Fran\u00e7aise de Basket-Ball changed its name to &#8220;Basket&#8221;. I&#8217;ll shut up before I further reveal I do not understand the French language.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/athle_type_treatments.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Athl\u00e9 by Dragon Rouge\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/athle_type_treatments.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Athl\u00e9 by Dragon Rouge\" \/>\n<figcaption>Type treatments.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The wordmark is accompanied by the full name of the organization below it, typeset in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.myfonts.com\/fonts\/latinotype\/arquitecta\/?refby=ucllc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Arquitecta<\/a>, which, in its Art Deco-ness in uppercase, grounds the wordmark through a more classic element. Arquitecta is then used as the supporting typeface for the identity with some elongated variations in some letters &#8212; tying it back to the elongated &#8220;H&#8221; in the wordmark, I assume. The result is kind of cheesy and, paired with the silhouetted photos, it starts to look more like a chain of gyms than a national organization.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/athle_instagram_images.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Athl\u00e9 by Dragon Rouge\" \/>\n<figcaption>Social media graphics.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/athle_banners.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Athl\u00e9 by Dragon Rouge\" \/>\n<figcaption>Banners.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/athle_event_graphics.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Athl\u00e9 by Dragon Rouge\" \/>\n<figcaption>Event graphics.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/athle_bag.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Athl\u00e9 by Dragon Rouge\" \/>\n<figcaption>Bag.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">Some of the more official applications are better and more convincing &#8212; the banners image almost makes me a convert and the social media graphics strike a better balance of effusiveness and official-ness. Overall, this seems to be positioned more like a lifestyle logo and identity with the intention of gaining a wider audience but maybe the Adidas-ing should be left to the Adidas-es of the world, not national governing bodies.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1920, F\u00e9d\u00e9ration fran\u00e7aise d&apos;athl\u00e9tisme (&quot;French Athletics Federation&quot; in English, FFA for short) is the governing body for athletics in France.
