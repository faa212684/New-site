Aside from the sale, distribution, and wholesale supply of paper, the company also offers packaging products, inks, and chemicals to the packaging, printing, and plastics industries. The new identity has been designed by Sydney, Australia-based <a href=\"http:\/\/forthepeople.agency\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">For the People<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>The new identity celebrates the physical nature and tactility of its product range. The simplified letterforms of the brandmark enable it to demonstrate various behaviours and material properties.

Doggett was the least offensive with a type-only approach but it weirdly mixed Franklin Gothic with Gill Sans, which, no thank you, and BJ Ball had a clich\u00e9d paper airplane and an unappealing wide (stretched?) sans serif. So, nothing to miss about the old logos. The new logo focuses on the merger by introducing a monogram with a large ampersand unifying the old names into a new company. The execution is made using full and half circles that yield a huge ampersand, a small &#8220;B&#8221;, and a medium &#8220;D&#8221;. I know I&#8217;ve seen this before a number of times &#8212; because I just had a deja-vu-averse reaction to what happens to the &#8220;B&#8221; &#8212; so it&#8217;s not entirely the most original approach, although that doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s wrong for this project. Paper companies have the tricky business of needing an identity that appeals to their designer audience but they also do a lot of sales to non-creative businesses so this slightly more daring, abstract logo is kind of &#8220;out there&#8221; when it comes to the B2B aspect. The wordmark is okay, although there is something weird about those &#8220;g&#8221;s. The color variations on the logo are okay too.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ball_and_doggett_logo_render_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Ball &amp; Doggett by For the People\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ball_and_doggett_logo_render_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Ball &amp; Doggett by For the People\" \/>\n<figcaption>3D renders.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/247256080\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<hr \/>\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/247257773\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<hr \/>\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/247257334\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo animations by Dominik Grejc and Georgiy Kuznetsov.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Being such a simple logo, it lends itself to some cool variations and explorations of how it can be represented.

This meant toning down or straight up avoiding excessive graphics, and instead leaning more towards utility of information, simplified typography and a focus on making the materials do all the talking. The material is the central piece  &#8211; it&#8217;s colour, texture, smell, weight etc, and every piece of design is there to support it, not distract from it.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/63053223\/Ball-Doggett\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">For the People project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ball_and_doggett_business_cards.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Ball &amp; Doggett by For the People\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ball_and_doggett_various_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Ball &amp; Doggett by For the People\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ball_and_doggett_various_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Ball &amp; Doggett by For the People\" \/>\n<figcaption>Various print materials.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ball_and_doggett_tissue_paper.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Ball &amp; Doggett by For the People\" \/>\n<figcaption>Tissue paper.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ball_and_doggett_tote.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Ball &amp; Doggett by For the People\" \/>\n<figcaption>Tote.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The print applications are still in process but the renders show a good range of flexibility that help highlight the papers offered.
