In other words, the BFI knows film. And was in need of an identity that established it as a leading organization in the crowded film industry. Stepping away from film clich&eacute;s London-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.johnsonbanks.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">johnson banks<\/a> designed a cinematic identity around the idea of lens flares, creating a sense of movement and layering and, perhaps romantically on my part, a portrayal of those magical moments in film where you are momentarily brightened by a line of dialog, a great chase or a real display of emotion. Johnson banks&#8217; solution might seem complex and highly illustrative, specifically compared to the old logo &mdash; which I particularly like &mdash; but considering that this identity will live mostly on screen and in 4-color posters it is a refreshing departure from traditional identity design and quite appropriate for the client and audience.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bfi_angles.jpg\" alt=\"British Film Institute Logo, Four Different Angles\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The identity features four different &#8220;angles&#8221; &mdash; although an unlimited number of configurations does not seem impossible &mdash; to provide flexibility and variation to the institute.
