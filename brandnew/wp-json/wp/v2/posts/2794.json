These form the basis of an identity system that not only reflects what Jason.L sells but the way they do business &mdash; a little bit differently.<br \/><br \/>Along with a refreshed colour palette, typeface and layout principles, a new brand voice was introduced that centred on their positive, can-do attitude. All these elements come together to create a brand identity that takes its customers seriously, but itself, not so much.<\/blockquote><h3>Provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/JasonL_3a_logo.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for JasonL by Re:\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Jasonl_3b-avatar_family.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for JasonL by Re:\" \/>\n<figcaption>Complete avatar family.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/JasonL_1-hero-product-decal.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for JasonL by Re:\" \/>\n<figcaption>Decal.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>You can tell where this is going: funville, non-stop.

I appreciate that they didn&#8217;t force a smile into all of them and allowed the actual furniture to dictate whether it was smiling, content, or being grumpy cat like the wall clock. The new wordmark takes a cue from the previous DIN and goes with a more Futura-esque sans serif that still has a curly &#8220;l&#8221; that pairs well with the initial lowercase &#8220;j&#8221;. While in lock-up mode the avatars and the wordmark don&#8217;t quite come together the two elements work best slightly separated in application.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/JasonL_2a-boxes.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for JasonL by Re:\" \/>\n<figcaption>Packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/JasonL_2b-swingtag.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for JasonL by Re:\" \/>\n<figcaption>Hang tag.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/JasonL_2c-posters.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for JasonL by Re:\" \/>\n<figcaption>Posters.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/JasonL_3c-Avatars&#038;Language.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for JasonL by Re:\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/JasonL_3d-Fitouts.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for JasonL by Re:\" \/>\n<figcaption>Avatars and tone of voice.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Jasonl_3e-Promo-totes.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for JasonL by Re:\" \/>\n<figcaption>Totes.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/JasonL_3f-Promo-Notebook.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for JasonL by Re:\" \/>\n<figcaption>Even the promo folder has eyes.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/JasonL_4-Bcard-single1.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for JasonL by Re:\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/JasonL_7-Flyer-Comp.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for JasonL by Re:\" \/>\n<figcaption>Flyer.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/JasonL_7a-Livery_warehouse.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for JasonL by Re:\" \/>\n<figcaption>Livery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/JasonL_10a-Catalogue-Cover-Spreads-comp.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for JasonL by Re:\" \/>\n<figcaption>Catalogue.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">There is plenty to see in application and it has all been executed cleverly without feeling like a gimmick. The color palette, kept from the previous identity, provides a clean and fresh feel without resorting to today&#8217;s more typical &uuml;ber bright, vibrant color palettes. The typography plays well with the flat avatars and I love how in the catalog the avatars blend in with the actual products. Overall, a fun identity that establishes a distinct personality for the company.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 2009, JasonL is an Australian office furniture retailer selling everything from chairs to storage to workstations to industrial\/lab seating directly from the factory through their website, keeping prices nice and low.
