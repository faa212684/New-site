Compared to the latter&#8217;s populations of 4-million-plus each, Canberra is home to less than 400,000 people and its main industries (or areas of interest) are politics and public service, which has led to the perception, as one of our readers pointed out to me by e-mail, of Canberra being boring. Funded by its local government, Australian Capital Territory, Canberra is looking to change that perception with a $2.6 million project &mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.brandcanberra.com.au\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brand Canberra<\/a> &mdash; that has launched with the introduction of a new city logo designed by Canberra City-based <a href=\"http:\/\/coordinate.com.au\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Coordinate<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>Canberra is about connectedness and the exchange of ideas, with unique interaction between government, science, research, education and business. Because it&#8217;s Australia&#8217;s capital city, big things happen here. It&#8217;s a city for all Australians, because of the stories told in our great national institutions. Most of all, as we pass our 100th birthday, it&#8217;s a city that has come of age. Our new brand needs to reflect all that, and more.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.brandcanberra.com.au\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brand Canberra<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/canberra_brand_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo for Canberra by Coordinate\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>CONFIDENT.

Photos by Melissa Adams for <em>The Canberra Times<\/em>.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>There are two obvious reactions so far to the logo: 1) 2.6 million for that? And 2) It looks like the Melbourne logo. As we all know, the 2.6 million didn&#8217;t go only into the logo, but that&#8217;s always the price public projects pay for having to divulge their spending and then only launching a &#8220;logo&#8221;. At least the Brand Canberra website &mdash; and its seemingly infinite number of pages and explanations &mdash; helps establish that this logo is part of a larger project and also explains why this project is needed. As to the logo (and all the diagonal-looking rays and gradients) looking like the Melbourne logo? Well, sorry, but, yes, they got you there. It&#8217;s certainly not the same and it&#8217;s clearly not a case of plagiarism of imitation: it&#8217;s just not that original.<\/p>\n<p class=\"end\">In their defense, perhaps the angled aesthetic of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/canberra_100.php#.Up8Uz2RDvfY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Canberra 100 logo<\/a> influenced the new logo but <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/city_of_melbourne_detail.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">in both its filled and stroked form it&#8217;s hard not to draw comparisons<\/a>. If we move past that, there isn&#8217;t much to the logo. It&#8217;s an okay interpretation of the letters C, B, and R, the choice of which to use as a logo is the more interesting part of this exercise as its an abbreviation familiar to Canberrans and has been sold nicely to the client as also standing for &#8220;Confident, bold, ready&#8221;. Reportedly, the full brand rollout will happen in March and perhaps there will be more applications to judge this against but I&#8217;m not really holding my breath for what that might be.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"As an outsider you don&apos;t hear as much about Canberra, the capital city of Australia, as you do about Sydney or Melbourne.
