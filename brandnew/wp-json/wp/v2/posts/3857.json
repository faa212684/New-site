This past February Meals on Wheels introduced a new identity designed by Minneapolis, MN-based <a href=\"http:\/\/duffy.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Duffy &amp; Partners<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>&#8220;This new identity symbolizes the power found in people coming together &mdash; a forward movement &mdash; where the wheels of urgency generate an energy that is central to the very essence of the organization, just as the &#8216;M&#8217; and &#8216;W&#8217; are essential to the most beloved and recognized name that Meals and Wheels evokes,&#8221; said Joe Duffy, Creative Director at Duffy &amp; Partners.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mealsonwheelsamerica.org\/national\/press-room\/2015\/02\/26\/meals-on-wheels-association-of-america-rebrands-to-spark-a-nationwide-movement-to-address-senior-hunger-and-isolation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Meals on Wheels press release<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/meals_on_wheels_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Meals on Wheels America by Duffy &amp; Partners\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/meals_on_wheels_logo_cobranding.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Meals on Wheels America by Duffy &amp; Partners\" \/>\n<figcaption>Co-branding.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The previous logo was far from great but it could have probably been worse and there were no questions left unanswered. The new logo is much more logo-ish with the introduction of a new &#8220;MW&#8221; monogram that nicely abstracts &#8220;people&#8221; in the first letter and &#8220;wheels&#8221; in the second. The ribbon-like effect gives it positive forward motion and also conveys the idea that this is an effort that requires people working together to deliver. The &#8220;W&#8221; starts to look too much like a shopping cart, which I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s necessarily a bad thing, but I keep wanting to click it to check-out. The typography is good, ol&#8217; fashioned Gotham doing what it does best &mdash; being nice and sturdy and readable. The circle for &#8220;on&#8221; is a bit distracting and not sure it&#8217;s needed, it&#8217;s also the only lowercase word, which makes it stand out more than it makes it recede.<\/p>\n<p>The change in tagline is good, moving into something a little broader that highlights the idea of a network through &#8220;together&#8221; and opens up the possibilities of what the organization provides: Food is the main thing they deliver, they also provide more than that, so it becomes less narrow than the previous &#8220;no senior goes hungry&#8221; tagline.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/meals_on_wheels_identity_elements.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Meals on Wheels America by Duffy &amp; Partners\" \/>\n<figcaption>Identity elements.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/meals_on_wheels_stationery.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Meals on Wheels America by Duffy &amp; Partners\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stationery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/meals_on_wheels_factsheet.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Meals on Wheels America by Duffy &amp; Partners\" \/>\n<figcaption>Fact sheet.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/meals_on_wheels_online.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Meals on Wheels America by Duffy &amp; Partners\" \/>\n<figcaption>Online presence.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/meals_on_wheels_tshirt.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Meals on Wheels America by Duffy &amp; Partners\" \/>\n<figcaption>T-shirt.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/meals_on_wheels_mugs.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Meals on Wheels America by Duffy &amp; Partners\" \/>\n<figcaption>Mugs.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/meals_on_wheels_tote.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Meals on Wheels America by Duffy &amp; Partners\" \/>\n<figcaption>Tote.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">In application, despite the multiple images, not a whole lot to be seen. It&#8217;s the logo, front and center, with the blues and greens color palette. One cool thing about the logo is that it breaks apart nicely as seen in the stationery image, where the wordmark can stack or go full horizontal without the icon. Overall, this is a big improvement over the old and I&#8217;m certain that the materials will get a nice boost from this new system.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1974 (originally as Meals on Wheels Association of America), Meals on Wheels America is the &quot;oldest and largest national organization supporting the more than 5,000 community-based senior nutrition programs across the country that are dedicated to addressing senior&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,79,26],"tags":[123,314,40],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3857"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3857"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3857\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3857"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3857"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3857"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
