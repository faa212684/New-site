Its new identity by the Qu&eacute;bec City office of <a href=\"http:\/\/lg2boutique.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">lg2boutique<\/a> is based around sticks. Lots of sticks. Always forming an &#8220;N&#8221; with different stem &#8220;thicknesses&#8221; of one stick, two sticks, three sticks, lots of sticks, adapting to the dozens of applications created for Nourcy. Rotated 90 degrees it also makes for a cool pattern. At times it feels all just a tad repetitive but the initial premise is strong and the applications are really great, particularly that ceiling structure, which is part of the architecture work done by the Montreal office of lg2boutique. <a href=\"http:\/\/lg2boutique.com\/en\/work\/597\/nourcy-branding\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">2011 Flow Festival by Tsto<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_flowfest.jpg\" alt=\"2011 Flow Festival by Tsto\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.flowfestival.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Flow Festival<\/a> is a music and arts festival in Helsinki, Finland and its 2011 edition had a fantastic identity by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tsto.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tsto<\/a> that didn&#8217;t exactly &#8220;flow&#8221;. Instead, it jarred with repetition of letters and a vibrant red-only application. It&#8217;s almost like the craziest type specimen ever. When applied to programs and ads it has a very unique and energetic feel. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tsto.org\/work\/flow\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Marcia Hofmann by Ben Johnston<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_marciahofmann.jpg\" alt=\"Marcia Hofmann by Ben Johnston\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/marciahofmann.com\/about\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Marcia Hoffman<\/a> is a San Francisco, CA-based lawyer focusing on technology law and perhaps ironically her website desperately needs the same tender loving care that Toronto-based <a href=\"http:\/\/benjohnston.ca\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ben Johnston<\/a> put into her new identity. The &#8220;MH&#8221; monogram is very nicely done and the way the two letters share some of the lines is quite swell. In application, the monogram and its pattern version look great in copper against black and white and along dead animal skulls. <a href=\"http:\/\/benjohnston.ca\/18783\/5843819\/work\/mh-branding\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project here<\/strong><\/a><\/strong>.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Due to some constraints this morning the writing in today&apos;s Friday Likes is a little sub-par but that shouldn&apos;t take away from the goodness in the work coming from Montreal, Helsinki, and Toronto&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[906,967,564],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3806"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3806"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3806\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3806"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3806"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3806"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
