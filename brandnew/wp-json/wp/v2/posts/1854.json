These activities have now been organized under three main headings: Resources, Logistics, and Energy. Adani has 9,000 employees with offices in India, Australia, and Indonesia. Looking to further expand its reach and business as well as &#8220;to manage its brand actively and professionally&#8221; Adani Group has introduced a new identity designed by the Dubai office of <a href=\"http:\/\/wolffolins.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wolff Olins<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>The logic behind the new brand is encapsulated in the phrase &#8216;Thinking big. Doing better.&#8217; This is not intended to be an advertising strap-line but simply a shorthand to explain the spirit in which the Group works. [&hellip;]<br \/><br \/>Adani has also chosen to adopt a new visual expression to symbolise the modernity and international potential of the Group&#8217;s business as well as the simplicity of the integrated model.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/wolffolins.com\/work\/adani\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wolff Olins Case Study<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/adani_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"Adani Group\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/adani_icons.png\" alt=\"Adani Group\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Icons for the three divisions &mdash; Resources, Logistics, and Energy &mdash; above.

It was generic, swooshy, and with really bad typography. The new logo corrects at least two of those traits: The swooshes are gone and the typography isn&#8217;t &#8220;really bad&#8221; anymore &mdash; as set in Miles Newlyn&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.newlyn.com\/fonts\/fonts\/rubrik\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rubrik<\/a> &mdash; but the generic feel, now attuned to the twenty-first century, is still there. The lowercasing, the rounded sans serif, the colorful patina against a white background &mdash; it&#8217;s all there. That is not to say that the logo is bad, it&#8217;s not, it&#8217;s a perfectly capable execution, but we&#8217;ve been there and done that many times over. The real star of this identity is the icon set that gives personality and presence to the three areas of business that create a shorthand for an otherwise complex company. The icons are succinct and strong, if perhaps a little cartoonish, but you have to like that miner! Overall, it&#8217;s a good redesign and it&#8217;s a drastic and positive change for this company but, for the rest of us identity nerds, there isn&#8217;t much to mine from.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to Binit Vasa for the tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_120227_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_120227_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_120227_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_120227_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,36,26],"tags":[46,596,386,180],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1854"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1854"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1854\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1854"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1854"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1854"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
