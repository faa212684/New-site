It wasn&#8217;t too disappointing, given that the core of their visual presence &mdash; event posters, outdoor advertising, banners and such &mdash; used this uninspired, &#8220;safe&#8221; method of art direction. The old logo uses Trajan with the crossbars of the As dropped, probably a nod to musicians familiar with the marcato articulation symbol. This nice little idea would&#8217;ve made an okay logotype, but someone thought it was a good idea to improve it with the ever-popular swoosh. But behold, <em>this<\/em> swoosh had reason, representing the arched roof of the orchestra&#8217;s home, the <a href=\"http:\/\/kimmelcenter.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kimmel Center<\/a>. Then again, it&#8217;s still a swoosh.<\/p><!--more--><p>With a new orchestral season approaching, a free concert in the works, a new ticket subscription program, partnerships with new sponsors, and the departure of decorated musical director Christoph Eschenbach, the Philadelphia Orchestra doesn&#8217;t seem to have any problem with exposure. It just indicates prime opportunity for a rebranding. And overall, I am pleased. <br \/>\n <br \/>\nThe new logo sports classic Bodoni in red and gray, with a bold and stylishly customized P. The bowl of the P flourishes into a spiral, ending with a ball terminal that imitates the scroll found on many stringed instruments. A great example of how image and type can be fused to form a strong, legible, graphic mark. The formality of the didone typeface in the logo and in headlines is nicely complemented by dynamic photography, as seen on a billboard I spotted on I-95, and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.philorch.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">their new website<\/a>. It&#8217;s crisp, delightful, and it&#8217;s refreshing.<\/p>\n<p>My one complaint is on the scalability of the logo as a whole. The fine detail in Bodoni&#8217;s extreme contrasts is lost due to such a huge contrast in scale between the text itself and the mark. I wish the difference wasn&#8217;t so much. &#8220;Philadelphia Orchestra&#8221; is a long phrase, and maybe eliminating the space between them was an attempt to sacrifice space (no pun intended) for increased scale, but it&#8217;s not enough. On that billboard I saw, the P was clear, but the words were virtually invisible. Also, I can&#8217;t help but be reminded of Pentagram&#8217;s logo for the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.detroitsymphony.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Detroit Symphony Orchestra<\/a>. Does it matter, though? It&#8217;s not likely that one will be confused for the other.<\/p>\n<p>Aside from these two complaints, the rebranding feels like it&#8217;ll be a success. The timing is great, the logo is improved, and the new art direction, from what I have seen so far, is unstaid. Solid job, whoever did this!<br \/>\n <br \/>\n<span class=\"small\"><strong>Kosal Sen is a designer at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sidesmedia.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sides Media Studio<\/a> where spends his most of his time on advertising and branding for interactive and traditional media.
