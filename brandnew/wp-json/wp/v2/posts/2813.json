She is stylish, chic and on-trend, seeking fashion for a night on the town. The 2B woman was Tolleson&#8217;s muse as the studio engaged in an expansive discovery process. We pushed the label to embrace its fun and flirty fashion sensibility but held onto the equity of the brand&#8217;s signature heart icon and color pink. The 2B story is told through updated photo styling, a tone and voice with appeal to both moms and teens, and a visual identity that extends the application to shopping bags, labels and a retail experience with vibe.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/tolleson.com\/story\/2b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tolleson case study<\/a><\/h3>\n<p>All images below taken from link above.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/2b_bebe_detail.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2b by Tolleson\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo in front of pretty person.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/2b_bebe_logo_neon.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2b by Tolleson\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo in neon.

Specially one with poorly scaled typography inside. The new logo maintains the shape of the heart in the &#8220;B&#8221; &mdash; if you turned it a few degrees counter clockwise it&#8217;s there &mdash; and adds some youthful vibe with the hand-brushed approach, like soft graffiti. The straight up magenta color also makes it feel more nightclub than Valentine&#8217;s Day and the applications strike a good balance of cray-cray fun and entry-level luxury. Even *I* would want a shopping bag like that.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Launched in 2009 as a spin-off and concept store of the popular bebe (pronounced bee-bee) fashion brand, 2b provides a more affordable entry point into the brand through 51 stores across the U.S. and Canada, skewing towards a younger demographic&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,86,26],"tags":[367,369,265],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2813"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2813"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2813\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2813"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2813"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2813"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
