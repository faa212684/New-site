The university is situated on a 300-acre campus near the Houston Museum District and is adjacent to the Texas Medical Center. Rice is now a research university with an undergraduate focus. Its emphasis on education is demonstrated by a small student body and 6:1 student-faculty ratio, and it has been nationally recognized as a leading university for undergraduate teaching. The university has a very high level of research activity, with $140.2 million in sponsored research funding in 2016. Rice is noted for its applied science programs in the fields of artificial heart research, structural chemical analysis, signal processing, space science, and nanotechnology. The university has produced numerous prominent alumni, including more than two dozen Marshall Scholars and a dozen Rhodes Scholars. Given the university&#8217;s close links to NASA, it has produced a disproportionate number of astronauts and space scientists. In business, Rice graduates have become CEOs and founders of Fortune 500 companies; in politics, alumni have won positions as congressmen, cabinet secretaries, judges, and mayors. Two alumni have won the Nobel Prize, and numerous others are leading researchers in science, technology, and engineering.&#8221; (<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rice_University\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wikipedia<\/a>)<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/rice_university_previous_shields.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Rice University by Hawkeye\" \/>\n<figcaption>Previous shields.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/rice_university_shield_before_after.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Rice University by Hawkeye\" \/>\n<figcaption>Shield, before and after.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/rice_university_shield_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Rice University by Hawkeye\" \/>\n<figcaption>Shield detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/rice_university_owl_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Rice University by Hawkeye\" \/>\n<figcaption>Owl detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/rice_university_logo_system.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Rice University by Hawkeye\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo system.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/rice_university_seal.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Rice University by Hawkeye\" \/>\n<figcaption>Seal.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/rice_university_website.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Rice University by Hawkeye\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/rice_university_website_mobile.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Rice University by Hawkeye\" \/>\n<figcaption>Website.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/rice_university_scarf_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Rice University by Hawkeye\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/rice_university_scarf_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Rice University by Hawkeye\" \/>\n<figcaption>Scarf-y-like things.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/rice_university_podium.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Rice University by Hawkeye\" \/>\n<figcaption>Podium.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/rice_university_scepter.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Rice University by Hawkeye\" \/>\n<figcaption>Scepter.
