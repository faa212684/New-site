Triumph designs and produces a range of motorcycles from ones that go vroom-vroom really fast and others that go vroom-vroom to make you look like a bad-ass. (This should clarify my expertise in bikes). At the end of 2013, Triumph introduced a revised logo and new emblem designed by the London office of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wolffolins.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wolff Olins<\/a> with typographic assistance by <a href=\"http:\/\/face37.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rick Banks<\/a>.<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/triumph_motorcycles_logo_history.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Triumph Motorcycles by Wolff Olins\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo history.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>[We developed a refreshed logo and new brand symbol. For the logo we made only a small change, redrawing it slightly to make it more usable on their modern bikes whilst staying true to its original unique design and heritage. Alongside this we developed a new and bolder brand symbol to use both on bikes and at events and shows &mdash; this incorporates the new logo into the original &#8216;makers mark&#8217; triangle with a design that celebrates their British heritage. Supporting this we worked with McCann Birmingham who developed a new more biker focused communications style and activation platform and strapline &#8216;For the ride&#8217;. This activation platform is designed to highlight Triumph bikes capability to deliver the best ride (handling, drive, ridability), represent Triumph as a brand that enables the rider to have &#8216;the ride&#8217; &mdash; the perfect ride in terms of their experience (the desert tour, the road trip, the best ride to work ever) and ultimately position Triumph more in the customers world.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.wolffolins.com\/work\/triumph-motorcycles\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wolff Olins case study<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/alSMJLtFifg\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>&#8220;For the Ride&#8221; promo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/triumph_motorcycles_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo for Triumph Motorcycles by Wolff Olins\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/triumph_motorcycles_logo_detail_nerd.png\" alt=\"New Logo for Triumph Motorcycles by Wolff Olins\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail and logo detail for super nerds.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/triumph_motorcycles_logo_repeat.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Triumph Motorcycles by Wolff Olins\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo sample sheet.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The new wordmark maintains the basic premise of the &#8220;R-H&#8221; ligature wordmark introduced in 1934 but now comes in a rounded-corner, sans serif flavor that takes away some of the more baroque aesthetic of the previous version. I&#8217;m a fan of flared serifs in general so I personally would have liked to see those stay in the new version while cleaning up its usability as the new one does. It&#8217;s definitely crisper and better developed but it also lost some bite. The new emblem&hellip; I don&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s clunky. In the quote above they refer to a &#8220;makers mark&#8221; which I am guessing is something along the lines of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ebay.com\/itm\/Vintage-Triumph-Triangle-B-Motorcycle-Emblem-Metal-Badge-\/161204820247\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this<\/a>, with the Union Jack flag in a triangle; this new interpretation sort of looks like parts of the flag but it also looks like a pair of mechanical wings, neither very convincing or pleasing. It&#8217;s just oddly spaced and arranged inside the triangle.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/triumph_motorcycles_bike_shot_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Triumph Motorcycles by Wolff Olins\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/triumph_motorcycles_bike_shot_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Triumph Motorcycles by Wolff Olins\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/triumph_motorcycles_bike_shot_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Triumph Motorcycles by Wolff Olins\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/triumph_motorcycles_bike_shot_04.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Triumph Motorcycles by Wolff Olins\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sexy motorcycle shots.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">However, when you have sexy motorcycles to put the logo on and the light reflects just <em>so<\/em> on its metallic surfaces, you can&#8217;t help but be smitten by it.
