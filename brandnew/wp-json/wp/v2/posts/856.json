Certainly the circular icon they were using was rather abstract and nondescript compared to the identifiable bridge in their new mark &mdash; although I&#8217;m not sure this new icon speaks to what they do.

The new typography is clean, corporate, humanist and completely forgettable,\ufffda definite lost asset in the battle for visual brand equity.
