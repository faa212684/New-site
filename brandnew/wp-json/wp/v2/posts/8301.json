We figured that&#8217;s a slogan we should use. The thing is, we used to work in a design studio, and one of the biggest challenges we had was to efficiently deliver and manage visual identities we created. The more projects we got, the bigger the problem grew. It sucked. Hard. Brandpad was the solution, and it does make sense &#8212; that&#8217;s why we created it in the first place.<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/380264092?title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"360\" height=\"203\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Initially, Brandpad was something we made for ourselves. No one else. We wanted a system that provided a &#8220;no login&#8221; way for clients to access their brand guidelines and their assets after delivery. We wanted a product where the brand experience was made by us&#8211;where we could design the platform to match the brand identity. Most of all, we wanted a system where we could easily bring all our projects, old and new, standardizing our brand delivery and management process across our entire portfolio. Hell yeah, right?<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sponsored_brandpad_guidelines.gif\" alt=\"Brandpad. It just makes sense.\" \/>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Then we gave some friends access. Then they had some friends. That had some friends. Eventually, we opened up for everyone. Fast forward a couple of years, a lot of learning, sweat, and luck later; we&#8217;re suddenly running a software company with some of the studios we&#8217;ve looked up to for years as customers (we still do). Today, Brandpad is used by influential companies all over the world, and we give thousands of ambitious brands a place to live and prosper. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.brandpad.io\/?utm_source=bn&#038;utm_medium=post&#038;utm_campaign=makessense\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Give it a try and see if it makes sense for you too<\/a>.
