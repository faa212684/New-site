If there was any more evidence needed that Futura is working on a separate realm of identity than the rest of us, I think this is the smoking gun. Chickens, legs, arms, eyes, bricks, mouths, arrows, and patterns that would make Ettore Sottsass jealous, the suite of illustrations are fantastically trippy. At no moment whatsoever does any of it make you think of coffee and I will not try to defend that in any way but I will also not deny my guttural attraction to this. The typography is all kinds of stretched and elongated and inconsistent and I hate to love it. The color palette is also quite nice and different from any other craft coffee roaster out there, which, again, may not be an entirely good thing but it certainly pays homage to Austin&#8217;s Keep Austin Weird attitude. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/byfutura.com\/project\/superthing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Internova by Bunch<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_internova.jpg\" alt=\"Internova by Bunch\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Internova.hr\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Internova<\/a> is an interior design firm in Croatia with a particular affinity for tailor-made, wooden furniture. The identity, designed by Zagreb, Croatia-based <a href=\"http:\/\/bunchdesign.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bunch<\/a>, doesn&#8217;t have the typical punch of other Friday Likes but I thought it was a great example of a simple and elegant wordmark brought to life through thoughtful print production, upscale materials, and charming promotional items: those pencils are the main reason this project is with us here today. I&#8217;ll admit that I have no idea what&#8217;s going on with the | | \\ | pattern but that doesn&#8217;t mean I don&#8217;t enjoy it, particularly in the debossed notebook. This project also serves as a kind of palette cleaners after Superthing before moving on the next one. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/bunchdesign.com\/work\/internova\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Schnipper&#8217;s by GrandArmy<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_schnippers.jpg\" alt=\"Schnipper's by GrandArmy\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.schnippers.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Schnipper&#8217;s<\/a> is a family-owned comfort food joint in New York, NY, with five locations in prime real estate, from the Flatiron district to Times Square.

Energetic, bold, and playful, the identity elements come together in unexpected ways and add up to a flexible yet cohesive brand, from menu boards to soda cups. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/grandarmy.com\/work\/projects\/project.php?project=schnippers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"A relative roller coaster of projects take us from whoah! to alright! to hey! this week, with work from Mexico City, Zagreb, and New York&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[51,11,85,26],"tags":[183,597,186,1194,39,115,564],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7365"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=7365"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7365\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=7365"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=7365"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=7365"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
