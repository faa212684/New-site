Seeking to increase their profile and double their fundraising efforts, CCIA introduced a new identity in March, designed by Sydney-based <a href=\"http:\/\/purposeagency.com.au\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Purpose Agency<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>Put simply, Children&#8217;s Cancer Institute believed in Success. Nothing less. Period.<br \/><br \/>In order to communicate this unwavering determination, we needed to &#8216;open the lab door&#8217; and challenge the common stereotypes of scientific research while balancing the human attributes of the organisation.<br \/><br \/>The new brand shows that success is cumulative. Success is a journey. And, most importantly, success is not a miracle. It is the result of some seriously amazing scientific research.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/purposeagency.com.au\/success-nothing-less\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Purpose Agency project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/childrens_cancer_institute_au_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Cancer Research Institute by Purpose Agency\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo animated.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The previous logo&hellip; well, it got the message across. It&#8217;s probably way more effective in communicating what CCIA does than any new fancy logo ever could but as an identifier for a research laboratory perhaps it&#8217;s not the most optimistic representation. The new logo and identity focus on the research and analytical aspect of the institute by employing building blocks and crosses to communicate the sense of a growing body of knowledge to fight cancer. The logo comes across perhaps more as a logo for a children&#8217;s hospital than a research institute with adults in it but since the end goal is about children, the colorful and graphic approach makes sense. I am not certain if the specific shape of the logo means something in particular but, in its asymmetry, it becomes easy to spot at small sizes.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/childrens_cancer_institute_au_guidelines.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Cancer Research Institute by Purpose Agency\" \/>\n<figcaption>Guideline page samples.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/childrens_cancer_institute_au_business_cards.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Cancer Research Institute by Purpose Agency\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/childrens_cancer_institute_au_tote.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Cancer Research Institute by Purpose Agency\" \/>\n<figcaption>Tote bag.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/childrens_cancer_institute_au_print_ad.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Cancer Research Institute by Purpose Agency\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/childrens_cancer_institute_au_outdoor_ad.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Cancer Research Institute by Purpose Agency\" \/>\n<figcaption>Ads.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/childrens_cancer_institute_au_poster.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Cancer Research Institute by Purpose Agency\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/childrens_cancer_institute_au_poster_detail.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Cancer Research Institute by Purpose Agency\" \/>\n<figcaption>Poster (and detail).<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">In application, the identity has a great presence, with bold blocks of color stacking around the logo, providing a great framework to deploy longer paragraphs of text along with headlines or facts and some background imagery (as seen in the two ads). Applications like the tote and poster showcase the building blocks quite nicely and come across as playfully serious.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1984, Children&apos;s Cancer Institute (CCIA) is an independent medical research institute in Australia wholly dedicated to childhood cancer, which affects more than 625 Australian children diagnosed each year.
