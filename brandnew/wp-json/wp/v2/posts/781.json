It is mostly, if not purely, a nostalgic nod. Back in the 1990s, when I was living in Mexico City, we had one of the first DirecTV dishes and since I have always had an insatiable TV appetite this was simply awesome. Like many people I religiously watched <em>Friends<\/em> &mdash; sure, laugh away, you probably did too &mdash; as part of the extinct species known as <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Must_See_TV\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Must See TV<\/a>, the primetime sitcom block of Thursdays that has yet to be repeated. So, to get to the point, at 7:59 pm, right before said primetime feast, the NBC channel that we received invariably had a 1-minute spot for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.omahasteaks.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Omaha Steaks<\/a>, with a very jolly white fellow in a suit selling steaks. I was always surprised that such an offering (steaks by mail) could yield enough money to warrant such a prominent advertising slot. Yesterday, Omaha Steaks, a fifth-generation, family-owned business, <a href=\"http:\/\/news.prnewswire.com\/ViewContent.aspx?ACCT=109&#038;STORY=\/www\/story\/03-02-2009\/0004981082&#038;EDATE=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">announced its change of logo<\/a>. It may not be a primetime redesign, but it&#8217;s a solid improvement.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Thanks to Tony Hall for the tip.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,69,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/781"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=781"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/781\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=781"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=781"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=781"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
