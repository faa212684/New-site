With eight showrooms in North America (four in the U.S., three in Canada, and one in Mexico), Resource works directly with consumers, with interior designers and architects, and real estate developers and hospitality clients. Earlier this year, Resource introduced a new identity designed by Brooklyn, NY-, and Toronto, ON-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.executiveagency.us\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Executive<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>The resulting brand design sought to stay true to the nature of Resource&#8217;s transforming collection, with the identity including three marks suited for different spaces.<br \/><br \/>Brand touchpoints incorporate a delightfully unexpected use of space, matched with a vibrant yet sophisticated tone.<\/blockquote><h3>Executive provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/resource_furniture_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Resource by Executive\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/resource_furniture_logo_animation_a.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo animation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo managed to be both generic in its uninspired choice of Helvetica and depressing with its swatches of varying degrees of beige. It had a catalog-only vibe that didn&#8217;t quite support what I can only assume are high prices as well as not being representative of what is a rather nice collection of furniture. The new logo now reflects a design-driven, high-quality business through a simple and confident wordmark with not one but two clever twists: one, transforming the &#8220;R&#8221; into an abstraction of a contemporary chair; and, two, creating a space-saving logo that can contract and expand just like its furniture options. I absolutely love the &#8220;R&#8221;, it&#8217;s executed just right to read as both letter and chair and it works great as a monogram. I question the lowercase &#8220;r&#8221; that I get was maybe done that way to look like a table but it becomes a little distracting. Nonetheless, it&#8217;s great and I really enjoy the three &#8220;states&#8221; of the logo, especially as visualized below.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/resource_furniture_livery.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Resource by Executive\" \/>\n<figcaption>Livery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/resource_furniture_business_cards.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Resource by Executive\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/resource_furniture_ads.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Resource by Executive\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/resource_furniture_ads_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Resource by Executive\" \/>\n<figcaption>Ads.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The applications are all quite nice with layouts that look like room diagrams, fitting the elements in different rotations as if they were maximizing space.
