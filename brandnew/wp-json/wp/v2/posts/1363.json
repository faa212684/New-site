Providing fairly decent middle-of-the-road merchandise, JCPenney is an extremely popular destination for finding affordable items without the top brand names attached &mdash; they develop many of their own brands. Yesterday, JCPenney announced that its transformation &#8220;to become America&#8217;s favorite shopping destination for discovering great styles at compelling prices&#8221; would be celebrated with a &#8220;bold new logo&#8221; that is set to go into effect at the end of this month. The new logo has been designed by Luke Langhus, a third-year graphic design student at the University of Cincinnati&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.daap.uc.edu\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">College of Design, Architecture, Art, and Planning<\/a>. That&#8217;s right, a company with $17.8 billion in revenue in 2010, has a logo designed by a student. Oh, and also, forget all that complicated casing, just call it and write it as &#8220;jcpenney.&#8221;<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>To choose a new logo design, jcpenney sought submissions that reflect a wide range of perspectives. Participants included the Company&#8217;s associates, several design agencies and two art schools &mdash; University of Cincinnati and Rhode Island School of Design &mdash; that collectively submitted over 200 designs for consideration.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/ir.jcpenney.com\/phoenix.zhtml?c=70528&#038;p=irol-newsCompanyArticle&#038;ID=1531199&#038;highlight\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press Release<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p>Consider the above process against the one that Unimark went through in 1968 when it got the job to redesign JCPenney, at the time known as Penney&#8217;s, led by partner Jay Doblin:<\/p>\n<blockquote>[&hellip;] Unimark was selected through a screening process that ruled out twelve other candidates. &#8220;We had to find a firm with a broad scope, which would understand our complex needs &mdash; everything from architecture and packaging, to advertising and corporate design,&#8221; said Robert Smith, J.C. Penney Product Design Manager.<br \/>&mdash; <em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/303778184X?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=uc-20&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=303778184X\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Unimark International: The Design of Business and the Business of Design<\/a><\/em><\/blockquote>\n<p>True, the days of the monolithic identity designer or consultancy that could push their bold vision on a client are long gone but a 200-logo bake-off is the absolute worst way to define the visual representation of a company. Since 1969, when Unimark established Helvetica as the type family, JCPenney &mdash; excuse me, <em>jcpenney<\/em> &mdash; has been using the same typeface, going through a period in the last ten years (I believe) of placing the name inside a very tight square, which has been gone in the last year or so.<\/p>\n<blockquote>The jcpenney logo puts greater visual emphasis on a new, lowercase &#8220;jcp&#8221; by positioning it slightly off-centered in a red box while still featuring the Company&#8217;s signature red color and Helvetica font. The logo was designed to evoke a sense of movement and discovery as the letters appear to break out of the box, symbolizing an emergence into an exciting, new future.<br \/>&mdash; Press Release<\/blockquote>\n<p>The biggest problem I have with this whole thing is the perception that this is a &#8220;bold new logo&#8221;. It&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s rearranging the chairs on the Titanic, reupholstering them if you want to be generous. But bold or new? No way. Looking at the result&hellip; as a type exercise it&#8217;s actually very decent, it&#8217;s well spaced and nicely positioned, can&#8217;t argue with that but it is also a confusing visual and verbal nomenclature. Are we supposed to call it &#8220;jcp&#8221;? What do we do then with the &#8220;enney&#8221;? Why the division? No one calls it JCP, it&#8217;s always been &#8220;J. C. Penney&#8221;. Simple and memorable. I don&#8217;t think the old Unimark wordmark was any kind of work of genius, it was one more company to Helveticize, and it reflected a visual dogma of the time. This new logo simply waters down that premise without really looking at what the company might be able to contribute to twenty-first century retail.<\/p>\n<p>This whole post is in no way a knock on Luke&#8217;s work, his actual execution is perfectly acceptable and so much power to him for being able to have such a high-profile mark in his portfolio, but the process that led to it and what the result represents is a little too disheartening.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to Amar Singh for the tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_110223_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_110223_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_110223_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_110223_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,86,26],"tags":[195,477,309,42,478],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1363"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1363"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1363\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1363"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1363"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1363"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
