But it doesn&#8217;t take a local to recognize the progressive personality of the city and the rich visual landscape in which it thrives. Yesterday, Lord Mayor Robert Doyle unveiled a new identity that will represent the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.melbourne.vic.gov.au\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">City of Melbourne<\/a>, and provided plenty of rationale behind the new identity replacing a logo designed in the early 1990s.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/city_of_melbourne_press.jpg\" alt=\"City of Melbourne Logo, Press Announcement\" \/><\/p>\n<div class=\"caption\">Lord Mayor Robert Doyle announces the new identity.<\/div>\n<blockquote>&#8220;The &#8216;M&#8217; design will become an icon for Melbourne, synonymous with the modern, vibrant, cool city Melbourne is today and will continue to be in the future.<br \/><br \/>&#8220;The new identity will deliver more impact, be stronger, more flexible and reduce confusion as to who is delivering services. It will build greater long term identification and align with best practice around the world.&#8221;<br \/><br \/>&#8220;The new brand is strong and leading edge and will be instantly recognised as belonging to the City of Melbourne.&#8221;<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.melbourne.vic.gov.au\/info.cfm?top=228&#038;pg=715&#038;st=1125\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press Release<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><object width=\"560\" height=\"340\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/svNpa1NFsB4&#038;hl=en&#038;fs=1&#038;\"><\/param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"><\/param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"><\/param><embed src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/svNpa1NFsB4&#038;hl=en&#038;fs=1&#038;\" type=\"application\/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"560\" height=\"340\"><\/embed><\/object><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/city_of_melbourne_detail.jpg\" alt=\"City of Melbourne Logo, Alternate Applications\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/city_of_melbourne_alternates.jpg\" alt=\"City of Melbourne Logo, Alternate Applications\" \/><\/p>\n<div class=\"caption\">Various full-color and 1-color iterations of the logo.<\/div>\n<p>The identity design was developed by the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.landor.com\/index.cfm?do=aboutus.sydney&#038;bhcp=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sydney office of Landor<\/a> and the City of Melbourne paid $A91,000 (US$74,000) in &#8220;preliminary research for the new brand&#8221; and $A148,000 (US$120,000) for the design itself <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theage.com.au\/national\/melbournes-240000-makeover-20090722-dt0o.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">according to Doyle<\/a>. Of course, any dollar amount ignites ire in people and it&#8217;s so easy to say &#8220;$A240,000 for a fat blocky M?&#8221;. Yes, that&#8217;s what things cost people, get over it. But back to the identity.<\/p>\n<p>There is something very appealing and avant garde about this logo and it walks a fine line between trendy-and-useless and progressive-and-defining, but I think it definitely swings to the latter. There is a really great tension created by the detail and overlay on the left side of the M and how it resolves into something more simple on the right side. The gradients are subtle and help add a sense of depth and breadth that you would not get with a flat logo, which is clearly evident in the 1-color application where the logo looks like a bad diagram in progress and loses its enigmatic feeling from the color version. The type selection is also unconventional and helps set apart the City of Melbourne from all other international cities with common, lowercase sans serifs. As the spreads below show, this identity has impact and adaptability beyond the logo and looks remarkably vibrant, dynamic and multi faceted, which is how I imagine the City of Melbourne to be.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/city_of_melbourne_print_00.jpg\" alt=\"City of Melbourne, Council Plan 2009 &ndash; 2013\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/city_of_melbourne_print_01.jpg\" alt=\"City of Melbourne, Council Plan 2009 &ndash; 2013\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/city_of_melbourne_print_02.jpg\" alt=\"City of Melbourne, Council Plan 2009 &ndash; 2013\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/city_of_melbourne_print_03.jpg\" alt=\"City of Melbourne, Council Plan 2009 &ndash; 2013\" \/><\/p>\n<div class=\"caption\">Cover and spreads from the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.melbourne.vic.gov.au\/info.cfm?top=202&#038;pg=1864\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Council Plan 2009 &ndash; 2013<\/a>.<\/div>\n<h4>Thanks to Josh Darvill for first tip.<br \/><br \/><\/h4>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_20090722_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_20090722_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_20090722_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_20090722_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,64,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/884"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=884"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/884\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=884"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=884"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=884"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
