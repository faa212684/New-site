This week Gallaudet introduced a new logo, designed by an internal design committee with two Gallaudet alumni, Zhou Fang and Scott Carollo, credited as the designers. The process of the redesign has been thoroughly documented <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gallaudet.edu\/Communications_and_Public_Relations\/Logo_Redesign.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>The symbolic design of the logo represents the university&#8217;s bilingual mission by portraying &#8220;Gallaudet University&#8221; in American Sign Language (ASL) as well as in English, the two languages contained in the mission. The ASL component is demonstrated by the two arches meeting at a point.  The design represents the movement of the sign for &#8220;Gallaudet&#8221; which is the letter &#8220;g&#8221; formed with the forefinger and thumb making an arch across the brow and meeting near the temple.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gallaudet.edu\/News\/Announcing_new_logo.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press Release<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/gallaudet_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"Gallaudet University\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/gallaudet_g.jpg\" alt=\"Gallaudet University\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">American Sign Language, letter G.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/gallaudet_sign.jpg\" alt=\"Gallaudet University\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">&#8220;Stylized&#8221; letter G in sign language specific to Gallaudet University.<\/p>\n<p>This is probably one of the best logos of the year in concept but also one of the worst in execution. Starting with the two open points of the sign language letter G and swooshing it both visually and with the motion of the hands is pretty brilliant as a way to create a unique identifier for the university, no much different or unifying than, say, the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hook_'em_Horns\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hook &#8217;em Horns<\/a> hand signal of UT. Unfortunately the execution is bland and antiquated with some terribly uninspired typeset serif and a double-swoosh that, even though grounded in a great concept, looks like a hundred other swoosh logos. Substance tends to trump style, but bad style can ruin the best substance.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to James I.
