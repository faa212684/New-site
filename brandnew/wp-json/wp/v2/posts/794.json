Last Monday, Wisconsin Governor Jim Doyle unveiled the new logo and slogan for the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.travelwisconsin.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wisconsin Department of Tourism<\/a> to help attract visitors to the state as well as helping it portray a positive image. Like most state or city logos, the Wisconsin logo has ignited plenty of criticism, and even though I am absolutely no fan of the logo I thought I could debunk a couple of its publicly mocked misgivings.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/wisconsin_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"Wisconsin Logo, Detail\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The most common complaint is its cost, at $50,000 of tax payers&rsquo; money. The basic response is &#8220;$50,000 for that?&#8221; No, people, it&#8217;s not. $50,000 covers more than just coming up with a slogan, a typeface and an icon. But that has always been the problem of reporting costs when announcing a logo, people just assume the designers pocketed all the money. I can&#8217;t verify that the designers &mdash; in this case, Wisconsin-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.redbrownkle.com\/have_flash.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Red Brown Kl&eacute;<\/a> &mdash; didn&#8217;t pocket all the money but I am pretty positive this was not a $50,000-fee identity job. <\/p>\n<p>The other main complaint was the slogan, &#8220;Live like you mean it,&#8221; which has been used by other products, campaigns and, as has been quoted in articles, even by motivational speakers and authors. Gasp, the horror: &#8220;motivational speakers and authors&#8221; have used a common phrase before Wisconsin! What a travesty. Again, people criticizing this logo need to get a grip, the problem with the tag line isn&#8217;t that it has been used before but simply that it&#8217;s generic without any specificity to Wisconsin. But so is &#8220;I Love New York&#8221;, you can love any darn state, so why does &#8220;I Love New York&#8221; only work for New York? It&#8217;s about building that message in people&#8217;s heads and if Wisconsin wants to embed the thought of living life as if you meant it, so be it, give it a chance.<\/p>\n<p>Then there is the matter of the logo itself: a man (a boy?) doing a cartwheel over one of the strangest typefaces I&#8217;ve ever seen. Some people are offended that it was a male doing the cartwheel, ostensibly emasculating the entire Wisconsin female population. Others are offended that it&#8217;s a clown representing the state, and that the logo will only work when promoting a circus coming to town. There are many formal problems with the logo, starting with the typeface, and then the colors, but the concept isn&#8217;t as bad as it was executed. There is a free-wheeling, fun, liberating implication made by someone doing a cartwheel that does match the slogan and you can&#8217;t blame the designers for trying to capture that, it was just unfortunately not well translated into a visual.<\/p>\n<p>The logo is far from perfect, and I would be the first one in line to suggest changes, but I am constantly more appalled by the behavior of people in the media who suggest that they could have done it better, or that a contest paying $500 to the winner would have been better. And the problem isn&#8217;t the resulting design, but that the process of designing an identity is completely misunderstood and the media will be the first to exploit that. Anyway, just a side rant using this logo as a delivery. Go at it, I guess.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[64,12,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/794"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=794"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/794\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=794"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=794"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=794"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
