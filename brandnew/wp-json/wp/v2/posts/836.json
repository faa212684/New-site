In this case, the metal and hardcore texture of the logo really brings to life the bad-assedness that these glasses must be, and communicates that they are tough, durable and can withstand any sort of pressure. A black and white logo sometimes simply can&#8217;t do that. And as you can see in the packaging shots below, it can look pretty crisp. There is a 1-color application for the new logo and it works just fine too.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ess_logo_1color.gif\" alt=\"ESS Logo, 1-color\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ess_pacakging.jpg\" alt=\"ESS Packaging, Before and After\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Before and after of three different products.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>I would describe this as a really encouraging redesign; it just breathes new life into what was really a poor logo and identity, giving ESS a very appropriate look.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ess_field.jpg\" alt=\"ESS in Action\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Afghan Police\/soldiers (the good guys) with a banner of ESS.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,51,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/836"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=836"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/836\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=836"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=836"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=836"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
