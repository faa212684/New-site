Launched successfully as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kickstarter.com\/projects\/jansapper\/paperlike-make-ipad-pro-feel-like-writing-on-paper\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a Kickstarter campaign<\/a> with 1,914 backers, version 1 was a success, but instead of resting on its paper-like laurels, Jan and his team have revisited the product to launch version 2 with improved texture and screen refraction. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kickstarter.com\/projects\/jansapper\/paperlike-ipad-screen-protector-with-nanodots\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Its second, funded Kickstarter campaign<\/a> attracted almost 10,000 backers and the product will now also be available in retail stores worldwide. The new identity has been designed by Copenhagen, Denmark-based <a href=\"https:\/\/danielflosser.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Daniel Fl\u00f6sser<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>Correlating with the launch of an updated version of the Paperlike, and a move into physical retail, we launched a new identity. It&#8217;s rare to have a product brand with a name that speaks to the product function in such a straight talking way, without being generic. We wanted to create an identity that continued this direct approach, and the logo does just that by being a visual representation of the product, swaying into P for Paperlike. The result is a strikingly simple visual identity, activated across website, retail, packaging design and more.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/danielflosser.com\/paperlike\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Daniel Fl\u00f6sser project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/paperlike_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Paperlike by Daniel Fl\u00f6sser\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo had the right idea of conveying the sense that its product would maintain the roughness and texture of drawing on paper through its marker-drawn wordmark but the execution was pretty bad, looking like they held auditions to find the person with the worst handwriting possible. Too bad I didn&#8217;t know about it as I would have won. Point being, it wasn&#8217;t a logo that made it feel like my experience using this product would be enhanced but rather that it would be somewhat unpleasant. And why didn&#8217;t they fix the &#8220;Pap&#8221; spacing?! Anyway, enough about the old logo. The new logo may have lost the paper-ish texture but the slick new approach makes it feel like this is a high quality, professional product that positions it more as a productivity tool than an artsy whim. The icon\/monogram is quite nice, folding a depiction of the product into a &#8220;P&#8221; &#8212; simple but effective and manages to speak to the malleability and transparency of the cover. The wordmark, in <a href=\"https:\/\/sharptype.co\/typefaces\/centra\/centra-no1\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Centra No.1<\/a>, looks elegant but also software-like, as something that could come out of Apple or Microsoft, which gives it a more mature appearance. Additional golf claps for the thickness of the icon matching the thickness of the wordmark.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/paperlike_typography.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Paperlike by Daniel Fl\u00f6sser\" \/>\n<figcaption>Typography.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/paperlike_illustration.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Paperlike by Daniel Fl\u00f6sser\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/paperlike_illustration_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Paperlike by Daniel Fl\u00f6sser\" \/>\n<figcaption>Illustration by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nataschepy.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nata Schepy<\/a>.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>While the illustrations aren&#8217;t surprising in their faceless approach &#8212; and they might seem more familiar than usual as they were done by the same illustrator that did <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/new_logo_and_identity_for_onfido_by_koto.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Onfido<\/a> &#8212; I would say that this is the one project where they are the most appropriate, highlighting the ability to make slick yet rough lines on the iPad.

It&#8217;s amazing what can be done with great product photography and then getting out of the way as a designer.
