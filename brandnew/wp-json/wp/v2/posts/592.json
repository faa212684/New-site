On February <a href=\"http:\/\/www.donatos.com\/about_donatos\/news_detail.asp?ID=40\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">it officially launched its new identity and campaign<\/a>, but the identity has been in the works since 2006 undertaken by Interbrand&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.designforum.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Design Forum<\/a> &mdash; somebody needs an update of their own if you know what I mean. The new logo and a prototype store were tested in a 1975-square-foot prototype in a western suburb of Columbus in 2006, and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.vmsd.com\/index.php\/channel\/27\/id\/10344\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here you can see some nice shots of the updated interiors and exteriors<\/a>. Having never been to a Donatos I can&#8217;t vouch for the old restaurants, but the new ones look like what a fast food chain should look like in the twenty-first century and, unfortunately, that&#8217;s exactly the same thing I can say about the new logo. The old one may have been overly traditional, but the new one is far too technologically advanced to trigger images and cravings of yummy pizza. Donatos claim to fame is its Edge to Edge&reg; pizza, which is then cut in squares, so I guess that&#8217;s where the D-in-a-skewed-box comes from, but I&#8217;m not sure where the crazy wordmark comes from with those poor deformed letterforms &mdash; and poor &#8220;S&#8221;s they always get it the worst. The update, as usual, makes sense, the execution, also, does not.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,69,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/592"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=592"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/592\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=592"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=592"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=592"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
