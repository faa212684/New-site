Newsbeat is produced by BBC News but differs from the BBC&#8217;s other news programmes in its remit to provide news tailored for a specifically younger audience.[1] It is primarily hosted by Chris Smith and Tina Daheley. The 15-minute Newsbeat programme is broadcast at 12:45 and 17:45 during the week on Radio 1 and 1Xtra. Short bulletins are also heard throughout the day on both stations on the half hour with extra bulletins broadcast at peak times.&#8221; (<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Newsbeat\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wikipedia<\/a>)<\/p>\n<p>Additional good info from Moving Brands: &#8220;The way people stay up to date with news is changing, particularly for those under 25. Vice, Reddit and Buzzfeed all offer more entertaining, snackable ways to consume news, and platforms like Facebook and Snapchat are as much a link to current events as they are to friends and family. In this landscape, BBC Newsbeat, the national broadcaster&#8217;s news service aimed at 16 &ndash; 24yr olds, had some catching up to do.&#8221;<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bbc_newsbeat_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for BBC Newsbeat by Moving Brands\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bbc_newsbeat_identity_elements.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for BBC Newsbeat by Moving Brands\" \/>\n<figcaption>Identity elements.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bbc_newsbeat_bits_and_pieces.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for BBC Newsbeat by Moving Brands\" \/>\n<figcaption>Bits and pieces.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bbc_newsbeat_app.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for BBC Newsbeat by Moving Brands\" \/>\n<figcaption>App.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/129885187\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Identity presentation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"(Est. 1973) &quot;Newsbeat is the flagship news programme on BBC Radio 1 and BBC Radio 1Xtra.
