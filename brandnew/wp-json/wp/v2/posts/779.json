Designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.landor.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Landor<\/a>, the new wordmark is an excellent corporate design: It is simple, confident and has just enough quirks to make it unique and ownable. The condensed sans serif is a great way of creating a compact wordmark that has as much punch as an icon. The period at the end is my favorite part, it clearly states &#8220;the line ends here, we are the best.&#8221; In contrast, my least favorite part is the missing dot over the &#8220;i.&#8221; I have never liked that move. An &#8220;i&#8221; needs its period, otherwise it&#8217;s just a stick, and in this particular case, it looks like the dot was transplanted to the end, so as much as I like the period, it feels like the &#8220;i&#8221; had to sacrifice its own. Nonetheless, this is a simple, strong corporate design and major bonus points for ditching the industry-issued color blue in favor of orange.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Thanks to Jarrod Wubbels for the tip.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,37,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/779"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=779"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/779\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=779"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=779"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=779"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
