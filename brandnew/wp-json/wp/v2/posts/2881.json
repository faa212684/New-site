The logo for <a href=\"http:\/\/sevenseeds.com.au\/seeds\/traveller\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Traveller<\/a>, an espresso bar in Melbourne run by Seven Seeds, is the image of a shoe on the move. You know&hellip; it&#8217;s traveling. It&#8217;s such a simple and clever idea it almost passes for dumb. The execution by Melbourne-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tcyk.com.au\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Company You Keep<\/a> is delightful, in a pasty green and off-white color palette and a modest dose of playful typography. Americans might clamor for a politically-correct alternate or complementary version with a woman&#8217;s shoe, though. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tcyk.com.au\/traveller\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Cemento by Design by St<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_cemento.jpg\" alt=\"Cemento by Design by St\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">&#8220;Stylish, brutalist and robust.&#8221; That&#8217;s how I like most of my things, from burgers to television series to coffee and that&#8217;s how London-based <a href=\"http:\/\/designbyst.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Design by St<\/a> describes the new identity for <a href=\"http:\/\/cemento.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cemento<\/a>, the UK distributor of an Italian concrete veneer for wall panelling and furniture. Similar to Traveller above where name and image have a perfect relationship, here you read the name and then see that &#8220;C&#8221; and, bam, Cement! Thick, heavy, solid cement. In combination with plenty of white space and Avant Garde the identity achieves a fashionable, high-end feel so that it doesn&#8217;t look like any cement mix you could get at Home Depot. <a href=\"http:\/\/designbyst.com\/home\/cemento\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Delectaballs by Black Squid Design<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_delectaballs.jpg\" alt=\"Delectaballs by Black Squid Design\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">If you giggle uncontrollably like a 12-year-old when you watch <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hulu.com\/watch\/4156\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Schweddy Balls on NPR&#8217;s Delicious Dish<\/a> then the naming, identity, and tone of voice for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.delectaballs.com.au\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Delectaballs<\/a>, a meatball truck in Adelaide, will have you bawling of delight. Designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.blacksquid.com.au\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Black Squid Design<\/a> the identity is crude, humorous, and unapologetically so. Perhaps it&#8217;s a little too much but how can you not love a drawing of a meatball with legs and shoes running around.
