From the simple crown (that looks like baby of the old UPS logo and any number of Dutch royal logos) to the color palette to the stenciled serif to the accent of the &#8220;&oacute;&#8221; being an underline, everything has a wonderful air of modernity and sophistication. Just, stunning. Even the illustrations of rich people looking hopeful into their peso-filled future work well. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.anagrama.com\/portafolio\/167-naci%C3%B3n\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">San Javier City Council by Jose &Aacute;lvarez Carratal&aacute;<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_sanjavier.jpg\" alt=\"San Javier City Council by Jose &Aacute;lvarez Carratal&aacute;\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">It&#8217;s a shame that this is a proposal (not sure if done for the client or done for the fun of it) because this is rather nice. (I try to limit the amount of non-implemented work we show on Friday Likes but sometimes it&#8217;s hard to resist). Designed for <a href=\"http:\/\/sanjavier.es\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">San Javier<\/a>, a town in the region of Murcia, in the southeast of Spain by local designer Jose <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/Joseignaciocarratala\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">&Aacute;lvarez Carratal&aacute;<\/a>, the identity is an exercise in reductivism leading to a beautiful crest and textbook set of applications. I love how he broke down the old logo and new logo into its elements and assembled them back together. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/San-Javier-emblem\/11044061\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Mark Milton by ico Design<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_markmilton.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Milton by ico Design\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">For UK-based jeweler designer and curator, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mark-milton.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mark Milton<\/a>, London-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.icodesign.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ico design<\/a> crafted a pendant-like monogram of two droopy &#8220;M&#8221;s that would look great on their own, cast in gold, and hanging from a neck. The monogram is applied with little reservations big, bold, and red when desired and small, delicate, and gold when needed. It&#8217;s a great balance and establishes both a luxurious and playful feel for the brand. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.icodesign.com\/project\/Mark+Milton+Branding\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"A range of minimal, simple, and colorful projects in this Friday Likes with work from Monterrey, Murcia, and London&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[746,965,711],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3144"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3144"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3144\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3144"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3144"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3144"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
