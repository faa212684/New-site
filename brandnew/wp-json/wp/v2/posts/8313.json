Its success was instant, selling more than 300,000 tickets in its first five days, later traveling to Los Angeles, Miami, and San Francisco (where, after a 1-year engagement, became the first permanent location in 2018). To match and spearhead the growth of MOIC, its founders have even established a new company, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.figure-8.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Figure8<\/a>, dedicated to it as well as to new &#8220;experiums&#8221;, leading with a flagship permanent location opened in Soho in New York &#8212; 25,000 square feet over 3 floors of ice cream-related Instagram goodness &#8212; that opened this past Fall with a new identity designed by New York-based <a href=\"https:\/\/theworkingassembly.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Working Assembly<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><p>(Before getting into the review: Happy new year to everyone and may all your logo wishes come true in 2020.)<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/museum_of_ice_cream_logo_wordmark.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Museum of Ice Cream by The Working Assembly\" \/>\n<figcaption>Wordmark.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/museum_of_ice_cream_logo_icon.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Museum of Ice Cream by The Working Assembly\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icon.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo was mostly fine, in an unassuming Art Deco-ish sans serif with its biggest issue being how thin it was and its highly distracting \u00ae glyph. The new wordmark is an improvement by its weight gain alone, making it more visible and easier to reproduce but its letterforms are also a little more jovial, especially the round &#8220;A&#8221;. However, it&#8217;s not exactly exciting or even interesting as a logo. To complement the dry wordmark is a new icon in the form of an abstract scoop\/swirl of ice cream that spells &#8220;MOIC&#8221; somewhat cleverly in it &#8212; it&#8217;s a good idea and the execution was close but would have benefitted from a letterer&#8217;s touch to take it to the next level. The two elements together do get the point across, easily and convincingly, that this museum is indeed all about ice cream.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/museum_of_ice_cream_logo_locations.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Museum of Ice Cream by The Working Assembly\" \/>\n<figcaption>Location badges.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/museum_of_ice_cream_Guidelines.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Guidelines.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/museum_of_ice_cream_exterior_facade.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Museum of Ice Cream by The Working Assembly\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/museum_of_ice_cream_exterior_ticket_neon.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Museum of Ice Cream by The Working Assembly\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/museum_of_ice_cream_exterior_blade_sign.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Museum of Ice Cream by The Working Assembly\" \/>\n<figcaption>Exterior (New York location).<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>In a way, the logos don&#8217;t really have to do much heavy lifting as the museums themselves <em>are<\/em> the brand with pretty much every room being a photogenic brand touchpoint and instant Instagram fodder that effectively promotes and identifies MOIC with every instance that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/museumoficecream\/tagged\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@museumoficecream<\/a> is tagged.
