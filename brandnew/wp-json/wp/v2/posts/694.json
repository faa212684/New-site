Sure, it feels more corporate and like a multimillion enterprise, but there is something about postal service logos that call for a more traditional approach. The old logo featured the Crown of Norway (one of only three logos allowed to use it), a post horn &mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.stampsofdistinction.com\/2008\/03\/norways-post-horn-stamp.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Norwegian postage stamps since the nineteenth century<\/a> have featured the advanced sounding arrival mechanism &mdash; and a very European sans serif&mdash; which may look like Gill Sans, but I think it&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.p22.com\/products\/london.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Edward Johnston&#8217;s precursor for the London Underground<\/a> &mdash; that gave the Posten a formal, trustworthy aesthetic. In contrast, the new logo carries no meaning and, while in five or ten years time it will surely become ubiquitous and recognized, it doesn&#8217;t stand for anything. This is a very similar case to UPS, where the company was more about its logistics superpowers than the thrill of receiving a package &mdash; resulting in a more abstract logo, devoid of meaning.
