The identity by local firm <a href=\"https:\/\/re.agency\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Re<\/a> playfully takes on the name with a bare naked lady, drawn beautifully by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.chrisdelorenzo.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Christopher DeLorenzo<\/a>, as the main attraction. The illustrations &#8212; there are about five different ones &#8212; have a fantastic aesthetic, with thin strokes, dense hair, and halftone shadows that then informed the logo, which provides a welcome spin on the drop shadow effect. The blue on pink color palette gives everything a cool sense of calmness and smoothness. This project serves as a good reminder that illustration done and used well can be a fantastic asset to build an identity around. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/re.agency\/bare-witness\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Ian Bennett by Joel Derksen<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_ianbennett.jpg\" alt=\"Ian Bennett by Joel Derksen\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/ianbennett.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ian Bennett<\/a> is a residential architect in Newport Beach, near Sydney, who has a knack for simple forms and lines with the occasional angle to add tension to his work. The identity by Amsterdam- and London-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.joelderksen.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Joel Derksen<\/a> references his style with a bare sans serif logo placed at a stark angle in all the layouts, along with other typography, creating an interesting dynamic within each identity application. It&#8217;s almost like an early class assignment in design school but executed perfectly right and made even better by the choices in different gray papers that also allude to the recurring use of concrete in Ian&#8217;s work. Solid. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.joelderksen.com\/work\/ian-bennett-architecture\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Agder by Frank<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_agder.jpg\" alt=\"Agder by Frank\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">Agder is a pilsner beer brewed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.norskebryggerier.no\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Norske Bryggerier<\/a> in the coastal region of Rogaland in Norway. Designed by Oslo-based <a href=\"http:\/\/frank.no\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Frank<\/a>, the packaging references sailing, which is part of the region&#8217;s history and modern-day amenities, through a white background and a marina-like vibe. Even if that&#8217;s not evident, the &#8220;Agder&#8221; wordmark is killer, with a Brooklyn-Dodgers-meets-Medieval-Pub aesthetic that&#8217;s bold and exciting. The vertical placement of the logo is unexpected and adds to the smoothness of the can. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/frank.no\/arbeider\/agder-bryggeri\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"A little rusty on this Friday as it&apos;s been over a month since our last Friday Likes.
