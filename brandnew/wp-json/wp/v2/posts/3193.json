Their combined 38 stores have now been renamed <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ocay.se\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ocay<\/a> and launched with a new identity designed by Stockholm-based <a href=\"http:\/\/esseninternational.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Essen International<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote><strong>Starting Point<\/strong><br \/>&ndash; Ocay is the machinery behind the scenes.

But with the merger and new name (also created by Essen) both logos had to go and in their place is a super chunky wordmark &mdash; just like I like &rsquo;em &mdash; with plenty of bounce and personality. The four letters fit together nicely and the shifting baseline helps the &#8220;A&#8221; wedge in well and avoid the usual open space at the top. I sort of wish the bounciness was taken one step further so that it isn&#8217;t just down-up, down-up but a more varied rhythm. Nonetheless, the name is great, the exclamation point is great, and the color is great. I would love an office supply company identity like that in the sea of Office This and Office That in the U.S..<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ocay_identity_elements.png\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Ocay by Essen International\" \/>\n<figcaption>Customized version of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.myfonts.com\/fonts\/linotype\/railroad-gothic\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Railroad Gothic<\/a>.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/92940008?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=ffffff\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Spot.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ocay_animation.gif\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Ocay by Essen International\" \/>\n<figcaption>Exclamation point animation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ocay_boxes.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Ocay by Essen International\" \/>\n<figcaption>Packing tape.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ocay_bag.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Ocay by Essen International\" \/>\n<figcaption>Tote.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ocay_web.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Ocay by Essen International\" \/>\n<figcaption>Web presence.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ocay_signage.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Ocay by Essen International\" \/>\n<figcaption>Signage waiting to be signage.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">In application, the custom version of Railroad Gothic does most of the heavy lifting in large swathes of colored blocks, mainly green.
