A moment of national pride, where sacrifice becomes glory and legends are made. &#8216;The Podium&#8217; is the foundation for the brand experience across every touchpoint. The design uses the iconic three tiers as a simple visual metaphor that can be used in hundreds of ways. Layers of vibrant colour, inspired by Olympic venues, and an expressive, bespoke typeface &#8211; called Eurosport 3, 5, and 7 [by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.a2-type.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A2-Type<\/a>] &#8211; create a flexible and distinctive graphic style that is inspired by ultimate ambition of elite athletes to be the best.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/dixonbaxi.com\/work\/home-of-the-olympics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DixonBaxi project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/eurosport_olympics_concept.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and On-air Look for Eurosport Olympic Coverage by DixonBaxi\" \/>\n<figcaption>Concept.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/eurosport_olympics_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and On-air Look for Eurosport Olympic Coverage by DixonBaxi\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/eurosport_olympics_logo_color_variations.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and On-air Look for Eurosport Olympic Coverage by DixonBaxi\" \/>\n<figcaption>Color variations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/eurosport_olympics_logo_animation.gif\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and On-air Look for Eurosport Olympic Coverage by DixonBaxi\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo animation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The podium concept may seem like an obvious premise but it&#8217;s a reference point we haven&#8217;t yet seen from anything Olympics-related and given that the IOC doesn&#8217;t allow anyone to mess with the rings, torch, or medals, finding new ways to visually <em>say<\/em> Olympics is not easy. Taking the podium as a starting point is quite clever and, surprisingly, lends itself to some excellent graphic interpretations. In the logo, though it may not be entirely evident that it&#8217;s a podium given that the bronze level is at the same level as silver, which I understand that symmetrically-speaking makes sense and looks more balanced in a logo but it misses to go the full monty on the concept. I&#8217;m sure it was a high point of contention in the design process internally and with the clients. Still, the three bars make for a nice visual bridge between the Eurosport logo and the Olympic icons, both of which are the key elements that need to be communicated.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/eurosport_olympics_custom_type_01.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and On-air Look for Eurosport Olympic Coverage by DixonBaxi\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/eurosport_olympics_custom_type_02.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and On-air Look for Eurosport Olympic Coverage by DixonBaxi\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/eurosport_olympics_custom_type_03.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and On-air Look for Eurosport Olympic Coverage by DixonBaxi\" \/>\n<figcaption>Custom typeface.
