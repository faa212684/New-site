The key to success was tapping into kids&#8217; psyche &mdash; they&#8217;re the ones that need to embrace and get motivated by the brand. The target audience is 8-12 year olds, so we worked hard to avoid being &#8216;child-like&#8217; and focused on being &#8216;kid-powered&#8217;. Not teaching them, but getting them excited to take part.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.wolffolins.com\/post\/44224418999\/michelle-obama-nike\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wolff Olins blog post<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lets_move_schools_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"Let's Move Active Schools Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<blockquote>This is a brand that&#8217;s about doing it together. So kids don&#8217;t feel being healthy is a chore, or something they have to toil away at on their own, we needed to show a healthy life can be simple and fun. It&#8217;s dodging past your buddies on the court, chasing each other to the school gate, mixing it up on the kitchen surface, running, dribbling, stirring, chewing, swerving, bouncing, chopping, high-fiving. We captured that energy in the brand, creating something that can be broken into parts, played with, and joined up to represent a school, a community, a country.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.wolffolins.com\/post\/44224418999\/michelle-obama-nike\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wolff Olins blog post<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lets_move_schools_idea.gif\" alt=\"Let's Move Active Schools Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/60470065?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=ffffff\" width=\"574\" height=\"323\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Animated pattern.<\/p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/60470064?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=ffffff\" width=\"574\" height=\"323\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Animated ticker type.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lets_move_schools_tshirts.jpg\" alt=\"Let's Move Active Schools Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/lets_move_schools_w_flotus.jpg\" alt=\"Let's Move Active Schools Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">First Lady Michelle Obama at the launch of the campaign at McCormick Place in Chicago, Ill., Feb. 28, 2013.

It&#8217;s hard not to like this. Mostly because of the good cause. But also because it&#8217;s energetic, American &mdash; okay, I can see how <em>some<\/em> would not like this &mdash; and fun. More importantly, it&#8217;s not your typical apple-means-helthy-kids logo &mdash; see main <a href=\"http:\/\/www.letsmove.gov\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Let&#8217;s Move<\/a> logo &mdash; but a prompt-driven identity sparked by verbs (as seen in the type video) and by icons (as seen in the pattern). The combination is a perfect respite from all the branded character crap kids are exposed to every day and it&#8217;s nice to see the Let&#8217;s Move organization adopt an unexpected set of visuals and words. Execution-wise, this identity is simple and effective: the logo\/pattern references the stars on the American flag and uses fairly random shapes that simply look good together and the typography is contemporary and kid-friendlier with the little flare of the &#8220;l&#8221;. Having Nike behind it probably also means cool apparel and, although Wolff Olins&#8217; concept t-shirts are a little too artsy and abstract, you can see the real potential in the actual t-shirts produced in the pictures directly above. I&#8217;d wear that.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"red\">Additional images from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.behance.net\/mkeczyk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Michael I.
