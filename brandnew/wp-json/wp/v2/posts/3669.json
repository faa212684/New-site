In 2002 the brand name and the production facility in Jalisco were purchased by Bacardi Limited with the goal to bring the product to international markets. This past September Cazadores introduced a new logo and bottle designed by Minneapolis, MN-based <a href=\"http:\/\/duffy.com\/work\/cazadores\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Duffy &amp; Partners<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>The most distinctive feature of Tequila CAZADORES new look is a redesigned bottle with a unique and stylish shape that showcases the spirit&#8217;s premium essence. An embossed neck references 1922, reminding consumers of a long-standing heritage, rich tradition and time-tested recipe. Embossed on the back of the new bottle are words proudly emphasizing the tequila&#8217;s provenance from Los Altos de Jalisco and the 100 percent agave promise. A new cork closure adds a rustic yet premium appeal.<br \/><br \/>Carefully developed graphics communicate CAZADORES high quality and simplicity. The new label highlights the tequila&#8217;s iconic stamp, the powerful and majestic stag Don Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda admired from the window of his adobe farmhouse in Los Altos, superimposed above a new logotype debossed on thick, distressed paper. Bold colors help consumers better differentiate the four expressions: blanco, reposado, a&ntilde;ejo and extra a&ntilde;ejo. Finally, Spanish language labeling celebrates the tequila&#8217;s genuine Mexican origin.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bacardilimited.com\/news\/287\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bacardi Limited press release<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cazadores_tequila_identity_elements.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Cazadores by Duffy &amp; Partners\" \/>\n<figcaption>Identity elements.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The previous logo wasn&#8217;t too bad. With a little letter-spacing it could have been pretty good; if it had any issues perhaps it was that it wasn&#8217;t <em>macho<\/em> enough. The new logo certainly ups its macho-ness with a more spiky wordmark reminiscent of the prickly agave plant. If the &#8220;A&#8221; were better resolved &mdash; it&#8217;s too top-heavy &mdash; this would be a fabulous wordmark but I find them too distracting. It would have also been nice to see a flat version with a more streamlined chiseled approach instead of the gradient which gets a little muddied given the slender structure of the letters. Still, it&#8217;s an attention-grabbing wordmark that sits really well on the label.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cazadores_tequila_bottles.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Cazadores by Duffy &amp; Partners\" \/>\n<figcaption>Cazadores Reposado before and after comparison.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cazadores_tequila_bottles_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Cazadores by Duffy &amp; Partners\" \/>\n<figcaption>The new bottles.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The biggest improvement comes in the packaging. There was nothing premium about the previous bottle, with its haphazard typography and dated layout. The stag &mdash; which the original distiller saw from his window prancing around the agave fields &mdash; remains the central figure but has been redrawn with a more confident pose and great detail. Behind him is a woodcut illustration that seems to be from a different project but works surprisingly well in layout. The label is finished off with some Mrs Eaves, which I haven&#8217;t seen used in years. The embossed neck is pretty nice too.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cazadores_tequila_bottles_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Cazadores by Duffy &amp; Partners\" \/>\n<figcaption>Bottle and box.
