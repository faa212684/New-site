It was a fun two days and, as usual, we enjoyed doing some crazy stuff for the applications especially with the challenge of channeling Las Vegas&#8217; frenetic energy. I don&#8217;t go into the behind-the-scenes in this post so if you are interested in how we put together the stuff <a href=\"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/370366477\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this video covers it<\/a>. Long post ahead with lots of video files.<\/p>\n<!--more--><h1 class=\"friday_likes\" style=\"margin: 40px 0 12px;\">Vegas References<\/h1>\n<p>Given that the venue for the conference was in Downtown Las Vegas &#8212; the original townsite and original gambling district of Las Vegas prior to the Strip &#8212; we were heavily attracted to the 1940s and 1950s version of the city, which manifested itself in an eclectic combination of the niceties of Mid-Century Modernism and the tackiness of neon light casino-ism.<\/p>\n<p>The book, <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2EfSJam\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Vegas Gold<\/em><\/a> by David Willis, and the Instagram hashtag <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/explore\/tags\/vintagevegas\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">#VintageVegas<\/a>, became our guiding lights &#8212; pun semi-intended. While the neon signs are indeed the heroes of vintage Las Vegas, we were equally attracted to the unsung marquee signs that, underneath the glitz and glimmer of the neon signs, announced the various acts that were playing at any given casino and\/or hotel in movable utilitarian fonts. These two elements served as the basis for the identity.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/BN_Conf_2019_Case_Study_01_Concept_Signs.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2019 Brand New Conference by UnderConsideration\" \/>\n<figcaption>Various marquee signs from <em>Vegas Gold<\/em>.

We were able to locate a full package of vintage marquee letters that would provide us with a starting point.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/BN_Conf_2019_Case_Study_02_Font_Purchased.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2019 Brand New Conference by UnderConsideration\" \/>\n<figcaption>The full stack of 6-inch, Gemini-brand marquee letters.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>After scanning all the letters we cleaned them up, established some mathematical boundaries, and treated each character as if it had to be drawn with a ruler, compass, and\/or French Curves. We fell in love with the modularity of the letters as well as their flat tops and bottoms, which became more noticeable when the font was stacked, which became more interesting the tighter it was stacked. Said tightness became a key component of the identity.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/BN_Conf_2019_Case_Study_03_Font_Specimen.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2019 Brand New Conference by UnderConsideration\" \/>\n<figcaption>&#8220;BNConf Marquee&#8221; &#8212; not the most imaginative font file name but it served its purpose.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\" style=\"margin: 40px 0 12px;\">Neon Lights<\/h1>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/BN_Conf_2019_Case_Study_04_Flamingo_Sign.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Flamingo Las Vegas Hotel and Casino neon lights. How do you translate <em>this<\/em> into an identity that doesn&#8217;t drive you completely insane?<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>We wanted to capture the visual and sensory overload of being in Las Vegas and specifically of walking along Fremont Street &#8212; where many of the original neon signs still stand &#8212; which is a kind of frenetic on-off-on-off flickering of neon signs, light bulbs, and letters and the constant dinging of the slot machines inside. We took a special trip to Las Vegas, armed with a telephoto lens, and photographed every possible neon sign that we could stand under. We photographed them in bursts so that we could capture as many &#8220;On&#8221; and &#8220;Off&#8221; states as possible. From the more than 2,600 images we took, we selected the ones that yielded the best on-off states and that looked the coolest as abstractions of neon signs.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/BN_Conf_2019_Case_Study_05_Photos_OnOff_States.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2019 Brand New Conference by UnderConsideration\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sample on-off states.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>We then combined the photos with the new typeface &#8212; spelling out, as usual, &#8220;BNCONF&#8221; &#8212; by referring back to the marquee font in real life, where each character lives centered inside an acrylic frame. We replicated these layouts but in a looser way with wider margins so that the images could show through better. This modularity then allowed us to mix and match the different images that, when paired, create that sensory overload feeling you get from being in Vegas.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/BN_Conf_2019_Case_Study_06_Photos_OnOff_Composition.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2019 Brand New Conference by UnderConsideration\" \/>\n<figcaption>Using BNConf Marquee to frame and pair the images.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>And that gave us the primary building block of the identity: a constant on-off, neon-light-infused modular grid that we could apply to <a href=\"https:\/\/underconsideration.com\/brandnewconference\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the website<\/a> and social media posts.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/BN_Conf_2019_Case_Study_07_Tile_Composition.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>&#8220;BNCONF&#8221; animated.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\" style=\"margin: 40px 0 12px;\">Programs<\/h1>\n<p>The real challenge of this year&#8217;s identity was how to bring to life, in analog form, our on-off compositions that were so relatively easy to deploy digitally. Enter lenticular printing. A technique we never imagined we would use, since it&#8217;s something we usually associate with tacky postcards and cheap promos but it was the only way to achieve this effect. Luckily, our trusted printer, <a href=\"http:\/\/classic-color.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Classic Color<\/a>, knew of a lenticular sheet manufacturer, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pacur.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pacur<\/a>, that makes some of the best lenticular sheets available so between Classic&#8217;s excellent printing and Pacur&#8217;s quality materials we knew we could exceed our own expectations of what lenticular can do or look like.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/BN_Conf_2019_Case_Study_08_Programs_Effect_c.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Lenticular effect on three different programs.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/BN_Conf_2019_Case_Study_08_Programs_Effect_detail.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Lenticular effect detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/BN_Conf_2019_Case_Study_08_Programs_Variety_b.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Scans of 18 different covers.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Because we never take the easy way out with the conference materials we customized every single program by mixing and matching 12 different images that were each printed 6 times and each of those having a die-cut for &#8220;B&#8221;, &#8220;N&#8221;, &#8220;C&#8221;, &#8220;O&#8221;, &#8220;N&#8221;, and &#8220;F&#8221; respectively. This allowed us to create an infinite number of possible combinations &#8212; 221,298,739,200 to be exact, actually, according to our super smart 12-year-old daughter. Each letter had a peel-off adhesive backing and we manually placed each combination, one at a time over a very long stretch of hours. If you are wondering, yes, the counters of the &#8220;B&#8221; and the &#8220;O&#8221; had to be placed individually as well to match the &#8220;background&#8221;. Sure, we could have easily printed 12 different compositions in a single sheet of lenticular and have the printer glue them in some mechanical way but this hand-assembled approach yielded a highly tactile feel in the spots where each letter nestled itself tightly.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.00%;\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/BN_Conf_2019_Case_Study_09_Programs_Images_Used.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>A sampling of the 12 on-off images that we used.
