(In January <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/new_mobile_provider_blows_into_canada.php\">we reported on Wind<\/a>, the fourth carrier to enter the market.) Public Mobile offers a simple deal: For $40 you can talk and text all you want. That is, as long as you live in the provinces of Ontario and Quebec where it is able to provide service which, granted, are the most populous of Canada, but still a few thousand miles short of nationwide coverage. Nonetheless, Public Mobile is setting itself up as the carrier of the people both in its name and in its branding.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/public_mobile_odd_photo.jpg\" alt=\"Public Mobile\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Not sure what&#8217;s going on in this image, but it shows a bunch of the print ads. <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.publicmobile.ca\/blog\/2010\/03\/18\/public-mobile-opens-stores\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Image source<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>At the heart of their pitch is people, people like you and me and that guy and girl over there. In fact, Public Mobile is so proud of its people that it boldly claims that the ones featured in their print and TV advertising not only are real but that <a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/album.php?aid=154578&#038;id=169845613852\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">there was no make-up or retouching<\/a>. I don&#8217;t know about you or that guy and girl over there, but I sure wouldn&#8217;t mind some make-up or retouching if I were on a semi-national advertising campaign. Sarcasm aside, the execution of the advertising does feel refreshing, active and I would go as far as saying edgy, considering the industry.<\/p>\n<object width=\"574\" height=\"345\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/GR0WluIUDsw&#038;rel=0&#038;color1=0xb1b1b1&#038;color2=0xcfcfcf&#038;hl=en_US&#038;feature=player_embedded&#038;fs=1\"><\/param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"><\/param><param name=\"allowScriptAccess\" value=\"always\"><\/param><embed src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/GR0WluIUDsw&#038;rel=0&#038;color1=0xb1b1b1&#038;color2=0xcfcfcf&#038;hl=en_US&#038;feature=player_embedded&#038;fs=1\" type=\"application\/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowScriptAccess=\"always\" width=\"574\" height=\"345\"><\/embed><\/object>\n<p class=\"caption\">One of three new TV ads. <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.publicmobile.ca\/blog\/2010\/03\/19\/tv-ads\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See the rest here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/public_mobile_store.jpg\" alt=\"Public Mobile\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Collage of stores in progress. <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.publicmobile.ca\/blog\/2010\/02\/19\/public-mobile-stores-update\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Image source<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The new logo is not bad, considering that it uses abstract stick people and that it uses one of those abstract stick people in place of the &#8220;i,&#8221; a maneuver that invariable looks dumb but that somehow passes muster in this execution. Perhaps simply because it doesn&#8217;t stand out too much and blends in well with the wordmark. Now, I do my best to not draw comparisons between other logos, but this one is very hard to resist: <a href=\"http:\/\/images.google.com\/images?um=1&#038;hl=en&#038;safe=off&#038;rls=en&#038;q=publix+logo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Publix<\/a>. Yes, it&#8217;s a grocery store in a small part of Canada&#8217;s neighboring country (U.S.) but it&#8217;s a well known identity in the design industry and an identity firm should be aware of its existence. The similarity wouldn&#8217;t be so glaring if the two names didn&#8217;t share all the same letters except one. But I digress and I turn my attention to the icon. It&#8217;s also not bad. It is well proportioned and I like how bluntly it represents, well, the public. Overall, this is a strong entry in a difficult market and Public Mobile seems well positioned to play the scrappy card.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/supercapacity.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Andrew Hladkyj<\/a> for first tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_100406_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_100406_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_100406_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_100406_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[12,26,89],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1069"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1069"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1069\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1069"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1069"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1069"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
