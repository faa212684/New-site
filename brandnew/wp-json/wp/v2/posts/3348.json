Also, during not primetime you can still find the <em><a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Biography_(TV_series)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Biography<\/a><\/em> series which gave the name to the Bio channel in 1999 which gave its life for this new channel. FYI, for your information, stands not &#8220;for your information&#8221; but for all or either of these: &#8220;For your inspiration,&#8221; &#8220;For your imagination&#8221; or &#8220;For your innovation&#8221;. While its logo was first introduced in December of last year, the launch of the channel now brings us the complete identity and on-air look designed by New York, NY-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.loyalkaspar.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">loyalkaspar<\/a> with additional work on the print and out of home campaign by Los Angeles, CA-based <a href=\"http:\/\/andcompany.com\/work#fyi-launch-campaign\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">And Company<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><p>The name of the new channel is certainly catchy. Not only does it work on the same level as other popular cable channels like AMC, TNT, FX, TBS in that it&#8217;s an acronym but it also works as lexicon commonly used in verbal and written communication when saying &#8220;for your information&#8221; proves to time-consuming. I wish they had left it at that and not tried to assign it all these other corny things like inspiration and imagination. But I get it, you have to sell it to the audience.<\/p>\n<blockquote>The FYI logo and letterforms evoke the conversational nature of the brand. The comma is always a lighter hue and alludes to the idea that there is always something more on FYI.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.loyalkaspar.com\/project\/fyi-brand-identity\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Loyalkaspar case study<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fyi_channel_logo_detail.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and On-air Look for FYI by loyalkaspar\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The package for FYI was created around the idea of curation, inviting the viewer to discover the personality of the individual shows, which bring together multiple topics and interests. From the photographic aesthetic and monochromatic palette to the hand-crafted logos and custom hand-written fonts, loyalkaspar developed a strong ownable look that captures the network&#8217;s authentic personality, but also provided enough flexibility for original styles and genre curations for future purposes.<\/blockquote><h3>Provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fyi_channel_logo_crafted.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and On-air Look for FYI by loyalkaspar\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fyi_channel_logo_variations.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and On-air Look for FYI by loyalkaspar\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo variations crafted from real-life stuff.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The logo, set in all lowercase and punctuated by a comma, keeps things casual and conversational, very much in tune with the vibe the channel is trying to promote. The logo has a nice symmetry to it with the &#8220;y&#8221; cutting through the two letters on its side (resolving the otherwise nightmarish kerning problem created by a &#8220;y&#8221;), and the tittle of the &#8220;i&#8221; evens out the ascender of the &#8220;f&#8221;. It&#8217;s not earth-shattering but it&#8217;s well done. Additionally, the logo has been crafted out of different materials and given volume and depth&hellip; these are fun but I think the logo looks best when laid flat and in its front view.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fyi_channel_type_paint.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and On-air Look for FYI by loyalkaspar\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fyi_channel_type_sample.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and On-air Look for FYI by loyalkaspar\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fyi_channel_type_sample_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and On-air Look for FYI by loyalkaspar\" \/>\n<figcaption>Hand-written elements.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>I am a sucker for hand-lettering where you can still see the texture of the brush and paint, so this part of the identity is like catnip for me. I really like the four or five different styles they are using and how they look paired with the straight sans serif and photos, as seen below.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fyi_channel_compositions_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and On-air Look for FYI by loyalkaspar\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fyi_channel_compositions_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and On-air Look for FYI by loyalkaspar\" \/>\n<figcaption>Bringing it all together with custom, monochromatic compositions.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Part of the concept of the channel and its visual strategy is that of &#8220;custom curation&#8221; for the viewer and one way this manifests in the identity is in the imagery and sets used to present each show through monochromatic collections of items and props. It&#8217;s a cool approach to brand each show and give them their own personality and allows the channel to bring some additional flavors into the mix.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fyi_channel_advertising.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and On-air Look for FYI by loyalkaspar\" \/>\n<figcaption>Out of home advertising by <a href=\"http:\/\/andcompany.com\/work#fyi-launch-campaign\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">And Company<\/a>.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fyi_channel_message.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and On-air Look for FYI by loyalkaspar\" \/>\n<figcaption>Takeaway message.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/100952593?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=f0001c\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>On-air montage.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">The on-air graphics are fairly tame and straightforward, which is fine. Between the monochromatic still life images and live-action shots of the talent, hand-lettered typography, and newness of all of it, it&#8217;s nice to not have a bombardment of fast graphics and quick cuts of stuff. Overall, the new channel feels like Bravo 2.0 if Bravo had been conceived as what it is today from the start &mdash; that&#8217;s not a knock on it &mdash; and the identity is fresh and simple with a feel-good vibe.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Launched earlier this month, FYI is the newest A+E Networks channel that &quot;covers a range of stories and experiences that reflect how people actually live their lives today&quot; and &quot;embraces an adventurous, personalized and non-prescriptive approach to peoples&apos; taste, space,&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,66,26],"tags":[617,589,290],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3348"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3348"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3348\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3348"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3348"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3348"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
