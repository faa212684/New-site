In December, the campaign for a logo that is better suited to &#8220;highlight the provenance of UK-made products&#8221; became a little more upscale with the formation of a dedicated nonprofit organization, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.madeingb.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Made in Britain Campaign<\/a>, and a new logo designed by London-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.the-partners.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Partners<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>Taking inspiration from the Union Flag, the new marque works as a directional device as well as a logo in its own right and has been designed to work across a range of media, materials and sizes to ensure it can be used by manufacturers of a wide range of products. It has also been designed to be localised by county or region.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.madeingb.org\/made-in-britain-news\/made-in-britain-campaign-launches-to-promote-manufacturing-in-the-uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press release<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/made_in_britain_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo for Made in Britain by The Partners\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/made_in_britain_logo_detail_icon.png\" alt=\"New Logo for Made in Britain by The Partners\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icon detail.

The new logo also looks to the Union Flag for inspiration, taking a quadrant from the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Flag_of_Great_Britain\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1700s Flag of Great Britain<\/a> (as opposed to the more stripy Union Jack of today) which is a very recognizable visual cue and minimizing it to an arrow device that points to where the products are made: Britain, bitch. (You know, as in female dog bitch, no disrespect intended to my beloved readers). It&#8217;s smart, effective, and brutally simple. I also like that it can point in any of the four directions as an application, keeping a great reference to the flag. As a bonus for all of us, the logo is not set in the pervasively British Gill Sans! The only drawback I see is that the logo doesn&#8217;t work as well in single-color version, as it needs the blue-red-and-white trigger to identify it with the Union Flag. Nonetheless, a great symbol that with enough support and adoption could become fairly ubiquitous and recognizable.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"In 2011 Stoves, a British cooker manufacturer, launched an initiative to create a Made in Britain mark that gathered around one thousand businesses to support its use and generated a logo through a student design competition won by Cynthia Lee&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,79,26],"tags":[52,181,982,446],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2923"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2923"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2923\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2923"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2923"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2923"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
