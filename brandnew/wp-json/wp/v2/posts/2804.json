The behavior of this generation is extremely volatile and what is cool today, tomorrow is totally out. From the beginning, what we wanted to avoid was to be a brand created by adults trying to talk to young people. We involved opinion makers and trendsetters of this age group in the creative process and we tried to understand them, their universe and their modus operandi to create &#8220;their&#8221; brand. And of course all the process was driven by the pioneering spirit of the Optimus brand.<\/blockquote><h3>Provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/wtf_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Name for WTF by Havas Design+\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo on background.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>We developed the creative process beginning by the naming and evolving to the brand identity and its communication language. Our inspiration came from the origins of the Internet and the visual language characteristic of this time, that we recreated, redesigned and adapted with an injection of contemporaneity. The emergence of the Internet was in its time a revolution in the way we communicate, the same way this service is a revolution in mobile communications today. This revolution is also web-based, so it made sense to look for in a kind of revival this aesthetic of the 1990s, as has been done so many other times with 70s or 80s. In this case we had a huge difference, because our target was born in the 90s, so for them this language has some dose of freshness, which joined the irreverence and spontaneity that characterize this generation. With all this elements together, we developed an unexpected brand experience.<\/blockquote><h3>Provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/wtf_pop.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Name for WTF by Havas Design+\" \/>\n<figcaption>Point of purchase display.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/wtf_tin.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Name for WTF by Havas Design+\" \/>\n<figcaption>SIM card sold in tin cans of sardine, a typical Portuguese fish. 60,000 were produced for launch.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>All things considered I, and am guessing many of you, are so outside the realm of this target audience &mdash; unless you are the lucky parent or guardian of one of its members &mdash; that this whole project seems, indeed, like a bunch of WTF? Starting with the name, which I am guessing stands as much for &#8220;What the Fuck&#8221; in Portugal as it does in any English-speaking country. I wonder if WTF is now such a general-slash-generic term used so broadly that naming a service after it makes it impossible to own the name? Regardless, the name quickly establishes that this isn&#8217;t mom or dad&#8217;s SIM card.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/wtf_posters.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Name for WTF by Havas Design+\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/wtf_posters_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Name for WTF by Havas Design+\" \/>\n<figcaption>Posters.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/wtf_store_display.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Name for WTF by Havas Design+\" \/>\n<figcaption>Store display.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/wtf_store_stuff.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Name for WTF by Havas Design+\" \/>\n<figcaption>Other store shots.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/tFR8q-oGJ4g\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>30-second TV spot.

Even though I enjoy a bit of pixelation myself and geometric-based, custom wordmarks, the execution here has been pushed to its jarring extreme with a logo that isn&#8217;t quite pleasant on the eyes and a  cacophony of odd color combos, pixel patterns, and youths making weird faces. In other words: it works. WTF manages to look like it doesn&#8217;t care in the same way as teenagers act like they don&#8217;t care about &#8220;proper&#8221; appearances. At times, the identity feels forced, specially when they use photos of their prototype teenagers acting aloof or quirky but the cast of characters translate better to the found-footage style of the ads. Overall, the identity could have been executed a little more carefully and precise but what it says at the end of the day is that this is isn&#8217;t the SIM card service for me. And that&#8217;s a good thing.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Launched last month by Optimus, one of Portugal&apos;s largest telecommunications operator, WTF is a new SIM card-based service aimed at 15- to 25-year-olds that focuses on apps and services for text messaging, sharing, and staying connected to other 15- and&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[12,26,89],"tags":[617,433,130,788,905],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2804"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2804"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2804\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2804"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2804"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2804"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
