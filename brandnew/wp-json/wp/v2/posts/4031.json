Treating their hamburgers almost like pizzas, they offer different combinations with the appropriate names, like the Hawaiian that comes with ham and pineapple, the Mexican with guacamole and nachos, or the German with sauerkraut and dill. Another defining aspect of Bembos is their retail architecture <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=bembos&#038;es_sm=91&#038;source=lnms&#038;tbm=isch&#038;sa=X&#038;ved=0CAcQ_AUoAWoVChMIn7nElrmHxgIVTw2SCh18swA6&#038;biw=1551&#038;bih=866#tbm=isch&#038;q=bembos+fachada\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">which is totally cray-cray<\/a>. Earlier this year, Bembos introduced a new identity designed by Lima-based <a href=\"http:\/\/infinito.pe\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Infinito<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bembos_old_retail.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Bembos by Infinito\" \/>\n<figcaption>A sample of an old retail location.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>To Bembos renewal is a constant, their voice is always to keep looking young. And in that sense the client&#8217;s request was to align the new brand idea and graphics with the new millennial consumer. As a result of the process we reclaimed their pop art heritage, their slogans, and activities they promotes to capitalize on their years of market presence. We developed pieces from patterns inspired by the brand&#8217;s past that today acquire a new contemporary feel.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/infinito.pe\/portafolio\/retail\/bembos\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Infinito project page (Google-translated)<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bembos_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Bembos by Infinito\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The previous logo was quite a mess, with some really unfortunate typography that must have gotten poorly digitized in the 1990s and never recovered. The new logo somehow miraculously manages to be a sophisticated interpretation of the original, even keeping the &#8220;EMB&#8221; ligature and extra tight letter-spacing. It strikes a great balance between being very designed and still keeping a vernacular aesthetic. So even though it has all the trappings that would make for a terrible wordmark this is one cool piece of typography. (I sense I will be in the minority here). The red and yellow lines help maintain the original color palette and look like servings of ketchup and mustard.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bembos_patterns_badges.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Bembos by Infinito\" \/>\n<figcaption>Patterns and badges.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bembos_full_set.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Bembos by Infinito\" \/>\n<figcaption>Container system.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The project then gets even more amazing with the introduction of a range of Pop Art-inspired patterns in primary colors that wrap around all possible containers. What makes this more special is that the patterns are used big and gives it a completely different and unexpected vibrancy. Meaning, look at the dots on the far left french fry box container, there is only 15 of them where it could have easily been dozens to look more like the &#8220;Pop Art&#8221; drawings Bembos already used. Instead, this is so striking and bold and full of awesome.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bembos_box_detail.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Bembos by Infinito\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bembos_box_detail_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Bembos by Infinito\" \/>\n<figcaption>Take-out box.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bembos_fries_variations.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Bembos by Infinito\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bembos_fries_detail.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Bembos by Infinito\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bembos_fries_detail_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Bembos by Infinito\" \/>\n<figcaption>French fries containers.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bembos_wrapper_full.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Bembos by Infinito\" \/>\n<figcaption>Wrapper paper.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bembos_wrapper_detail.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Bembos by Infinito\" \/>\n<figcaption>Wrapper paper in use.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bembos_burger_types.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Bembos by Infinito\" \/>\n<figcaption>Badges for the different burger combos.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The identity comes with a full suite of cool stuff, from badges to typographic stylings to underlines and includes a shorthand &#8220;B&#8221; monogram with the stripes and a script version of the name. Although going in, like, seven different design directions it all comes together cohesively and festively.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bembos_retail.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Bembos by Infinito\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bembos_retail_detail.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Bembos by Infinito\" \/>\n<figcaption>Retail presence.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">Compare the above retail images with the image at the beginning of the post and it&#8217;s a complete 180-degree transformation in sophistication, yet the new look stays true to the fact that this is fast food and doesn&#8217;t attempt to pass as a high-end, locavore enterprise. This is probably my favorite project of the year so far. It&#8217;s full of energy, it&#8217;s perfectly executed, and it elevates this chain&#8217;s game above the growing presence of international giants like McDonald&#8217;s, KFC, and Burger King.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1988 with a single location in Lima, Peru, Bembos is a fast food hamburger restaurant that now has 55 locations across the country.
