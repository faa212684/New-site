More famously, Reliant is the name sponsor of Reliant Park, an entertainment complex that houses Carruth Plaza, Reliant Stadium (home to the NFL&#8217;s Houston Texans and 2004&#8217;s Super Bowl XXXVIII), Reliant Center, Reliant Arena and Reliant Astrodome. Reliant was acquired in 2009 by New Jersey-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nrgenergy.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NRG Energy<\/a>, an, um, energy company (if there was any doubt), that is a Fortune 500 company. Over the summer, Reliant and NRG Energy introduced matching logos.<\/p><!--more--><p>Unfortunately there is no press release or any indication of what this new logo stands for. But it&#8217;s probably for the better as it would most likely be infuriating because I don&#8217;t see any good rationalization or story coming out of this. The old logo looked like a frickin&#8217; energy company, no questions asked. It was bold, energetic, and it looked corporate. All good things. The new one looks like a printing company with the CMYK icon that also looks like crop marks. But let&#8217;s assume that I see that because I&#8217;m a designer and that the business clients of Reliant or even the public at Reliant Park don&#8217;t make that connection, then, yeah, they might look like cute little colorful sparks of energy. I don&#8217;t want sparks. I want bolts. Big, bolts of energy powering my energy stuff. The old one would clearly do the job, this new one I have my doubts. The whole redesign is obviously a move to appear softer and friendlier, which explains the lowercase name. Well, it looks soft and weak.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/reliant_park_logo.gif\" alt=\"Reliant\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/reliant_stadium_01.jpg\" alt=\"Reliant\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/reliant_stadium_02.jpg\" alt=\"Reliant\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Better kern that &#8220;r&#8221; before it&#8217;s too expensive!<\/p>\n<p>In the context of Reliant Park, the icon might work a little better, being so festive. But I still like the old one better.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/reliant_nrg_logo.gif\" alt=\"Reliant\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As far as the parent company, NRG Energy, the change was more needed perhaps. Was it a compass? A plane flying over earth? Don&#8217;t matter, now it&#8217;s sparks. The lowercase in this case is more annoying than with reliant. It just looks childish or like an adult trying to send a text message to his or her teenage son.<\/p>\n<p>Overall, the whole package lacks energy and sense.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dla-inc.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Roy Levitt<\/a> for first tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_110923_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_110923_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_110923_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_110923_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,36,26],"tags":[625,550,148],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1650"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1650"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1650\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1650"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1650"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1650"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
