Headquartered in Luxembourg, CEV has the authority and responsibility for organizing all European competitions in volleyball, beach volleyball, and, yup, <em>snow<\/em> volleyball. The organization promotes the expansion and popularity of volleyball, coordinates the activities of the 56 member countries, fosters the development of friendly relationships among them, and ensures adherence to the FIVB rules. Last year, the CEV introduced a new identity designed by Manchester, UK-based <a href=\"https:\/\/madebyalphabet.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Alphabet<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/a_P0S9HA7rs\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Brand video.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cev_logo_evolution.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for CEV by Alphabet\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo evolution.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>Born from inspiration of the flags of all 56 European Nations, the Volleymark is the centrepiece of the brand identity. The shapes and angles illuminate the spectacular moments that transcend the sport.<br \/><br \/>Once keylined, we used the flags as direct inspiration for the Volleymark. The angles in the design directly reference the angles used in the country flags. The final design is contained within the circular shape representing the volleyball.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/madebyalphabet.com\/cev\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Alphabet project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cev_brand-formation.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for CEV by Alphabet\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo concept.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cev_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for CEV by Alphabet\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cev_icon_construction.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for CEV by Alphabet\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icon construction.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo was pretty bad, with a wispy swoosh-based abstraction of a ball in an unnecessary and almost imperceptible range of yellows; the wordmark was, I guess, okay. The new logo has a much stronger presence and while I visually like its impact, I&#8217;m unsure exactly what the icon <em>is<\/em>. I think the main interpretation is of a player about to either serve or spike a ball (with the upper yellow triangle being the head and arms stretched diagonally) but then trying to interpret the rest of the blocks leads to confusion, at least for me. There is also the explanation that the icon comes from the flags but that connection isn&#8217;t super evident in the result. Still, for whatever reason, I kind of dig it. Like the old logo, the new wordmark is, I guess, okay.<\/p>\n<blockquote>We devised a clear branding system where each of the main competitions (National, Club, Beach and Snow) had a unique colour palette and crest, with smaller horizontal badges for the sub-competitions that sit underneath each sector.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/madebyalphabet.com\/cev\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Alphabet project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cev_brand_architecture.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for CEV by Alphabet\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brand architecture.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cev_logos_secondary.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for CEV by Alphabet\" \/>\n<figcaption>Competition sub-brands.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The sub-brands add to the confusion by adding elements to the beach and snow editions and the variations are so subtle I&#8217;m not sure they were needed beyond the change in color. The badge shapes and lock-ups are a little odd too&#8230; The thin stroke and the generously rounded corners are very different from the bold and crisp language of the icon and there is a lot of awkward white space within them. Their structure is a good start but the execution felt short.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cev_subbrands_in_action.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for CEV by Alphabet\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sub-brands in action.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The display typeface is a classic geometric sans serif with a modern and energetic twist.

I can appreciate its selection for the hard angles &#8212; that represent the odd angles at which balls sometimes bounce in volleyball &#8212; but it&#8217;s a rather unpleasant aesthetic, especially when served in large doses like <a href=\"https:\/\/inside.cev.eu\/en\/brand\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">in the website<\/a>. Nonetheless, I can also appreciate that it&#8217;s an unconventional choice that deviates from the norm.<\/p>\n<blockquote>The brand is able to flex from bold and vibrant to premium and elegant.
