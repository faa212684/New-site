Ramo snacks, sold in corner stores and snack stands around the country, are somewhat of an institution in Colombia, the most well-known being &#8216;Gala&#8217; packaged pasteries, &#8216;Chocoramo,&#8221;&#8216; a square of cake coated in chocolate created by pastry chef Olimpo L\u00f3pez, and &#8216;Maizitos&#8217; (Frito-like fried corn chips). The company was founded in 1950 by Rafael Molano, from whom it takes its name. Ramo was the first brand to offer prepared and packaged cakes in Colombia. The logo and packaging of its products have changed little since the 1960s. It has several factories throughout the country and produces most of its own ingredients, including flour and eggs, in-house.&#8221; (<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Productos_Ramo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wikipedia<\/a>)<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ramo_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Ramo by Misty Wells &amp; Zea\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ramo_logo_blue.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Ramo by Misty Wells &amp; Zea\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ramo_logo_red.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Ramo by Misty Wells &amp; Zea\" \/>\n<figcaption>On color backgrounds.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ramo_gansito_before_after.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Ramo by Misty Wells &amp; Zea\" \/>\n<figcaption>Gansito, before and after.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ramo_gansito_after.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Ramo by Misty Wells &amp; Zea\" \/>\n<figcaption>Gansito.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ramo_panque_before_after.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Ramo by Misty Wells &amp; Zea\" \/>\n<figcaption>Ponqu\u00e9 (spongy cake looking thing), before and after.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ramo_panque_after.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Ramo by Misty Wells &amp; Zea\" \/>\n<figcaption>Ponqu\u00e9.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ramo_ramito_before_after.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Ramo by Misty Wells &amp; Zea\" \/>\n<figcaption>Ramito (small Ramo), before and after.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ramo_ramito_after.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Ramo by Misty Wells &amp; Zea\" \/>\n<figcaption>Ramito.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"&quot;Productos Ramo SA is a popular Colombian snackfood company, one of the few independent national brands that offer serious competition to multinational brands like Frito Lay and Grupo Bimbo.
