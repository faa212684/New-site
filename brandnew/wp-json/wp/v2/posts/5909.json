Smith<\/a> is a curated, online boutique that caters to the fashion-forward woman and its identity by Los Angeles, CA-based <a href=\"http:\/\/katiforner.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kati Forner<\/a> oozes fashion-forward-woman-ness&#8230; not that that&#8217;s even a thing but the point is that it looks elegant, unique, and high-end. The simple, Art Deco-ish wordmark looks great in all the materials, especially foil stamped in gold but even double-especially when set in a concentric circle as a secondary motif. The watercolor backgrounds are pretty nice too; not an entirely novel idea but very well used here to establish a lavender, salmon, tan color palette. All the finishes and materials chosen are spot on. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/katiforner.com\/work\/h-smith\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">GIF FEST by B\u00dcRO UFHO<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_giffest.jpg\" alt=\"GIF FEST by B\u00dcRO UFHO\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">And now for something completely different: <a href=\"http:\/\/giffest.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GIF FEST<\/a>, organised by kult and Noise Singapore, is a multi-day festival in Singapore celebrating the best of the animated GIF art form. While it&#8217;s easy to convey GIFness online, it is much harder to capture their frenetic energy in print but the identity by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/ufho.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">B\u00dcRO UFHO<\/a> manages the feat with a, well, frenetic use of illustration and typography. The hero animated GIF &#8212; a kind of gummy skull (that you&#8217;ll have to check out at the link, since it was very heavy to embed in the composite image above) &#8212; translates amazingly into a busy, colorful illustration that easily becomes a recognizable symbol for the event. The typography is an old trick of throwing every style and weight of Hoefler &amp; Co.&#8217;s Champion (or Knockout) unto the page, so, it&#8217;s not new but when paired with this aesthetic it creates a very energetic result. This is probably not for everyone but I love the more is more approach of it and, more importantly, I love that there is a multi-day festival celebrating animated GIFs. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/ufho.com\/giffest\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Salt Real Estate by skinn branding agency<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_salt.jpg\" alt=\"Salt Real Estate by skinn branding agency\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.salt-projects.be\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Salt<\/a> is a real estate developer that builds unique, boutique &#8212; it rhymes! &#8212; apartment complexes in Knokke-Heist, a coastal city in Belgium.
