Two years later, Pentagram has put together <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pentagram.com\/#\/blog\/126869\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a comprehensive case study<\/a> of the work done by Opara&#8217;s team; Michael Gericke&#8217;s team, who worked on signage and environmental graphics; and the in-house design team at Cooper Hewitt, who have been implementing and further developing the work.<\/p>\n<!--more--><p>There are a lot of images at the link, which I have edited heavily for this post, so if you want to see more, make sure to check the link.<\/p>\n<blockquote>The identity exists as both an iconic wordmark and as a useful tool. It establishes a robust and flexible branding system for the museum built around a new typeface, appropriately called Cooper Hewitt. In a breakthrough innovation, the identity was conceived as a design that truly belongs to the people: The typeface has been made available free to the public, who are encouraged to utilize it in their own designs. The font was created by Chester Jenkins in collaboration with Pentagram and was also acquired for the museum&#8217;s permanent collection.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.pentagram.com\/#\/blog\/126869\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pentagram project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cooper_hewitt_followup_01.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: Cooper Hewitt Identity by Pentagram and In-house Team\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>I&#8217;m not going to go into the logo as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/new_logo_and_identity_for_cooper_hewitt_by_pentagram.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">I&#8217;v already done that<\/a> &#8212; mostly wanted to include it as a refresher.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cooper_hewitt_followup_02.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: Cooper Hewitt Identity by Pentagram and In-house Team\" \/>\n<figcaption>Type family.

As I also mentioned in 2014, being a fan of the Galaxie family of fonts, this is another great variation.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll take this paragraph as an opportunity to quote myself on what I thought about the range of work shown back in 2014, to then spring into some comments about the new applications: &#8220;So far, in application, it seems Cooper Hewitt is placing all its bets on their typeface, with absolutely everything typeset in it. As far as I&#8217;m concerned, it&#8217;s hot. But it might grow tiresome (and dull) after a while for both visitors and in-house designers.&#8221;<\/p>\n<blockquote>The Cooper Hewitt wordmark and typeface provide the strong but flexible foundation for a robust visual identity system. This is all outlined in a hefty 408-page style guide, handsomely packaged as a hardcover book one might find in the museum&#8217;s collection. The guide demonstrates how to apply Cooper Hewitt&#8217;s visual identity to every type of museum collateral, from letterheads, business cards, mailing labels, branded folders and envelopes, mailers, brochures, tickets, membership cards, wrapping paper and shopping bags to the exhibition labels, interactive tables, Design Journal and website.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.pentagram.com\/#\/blog\/126869\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pentagram project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cooper_hewitt_followup_03.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: Cooper Hewitt Identity by Pentagram and In-house Team\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cooper_hewitt_followup_04.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: Cooper Hewitt Identity by Pentagram and In-house Team\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cooper_hewitt_followup_05.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: Cooper Hewitt Identity by Pentagram and In-house Team\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cooper_hewitt_followup_06.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: Cooper Hewitt Identity by Pentagram and In-house Team\" \/>\n<figcaption>Identity guidelines.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>408 pages of identity guidelines may sound like a lot.

The logo is a very strong visual anchor and literally brands every piece with a big thud every time, balanced very well by either occupying all the canvas or creating enough tension through white space. The letterhead is a a great example of the latter, where the logo is quite big (and the address block set in humongous, like, 21pt type) but perfectly in tension with the letter&#8217;s text.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cooper_hewitt_followup_10.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: Cooper Hewitt Identity by Pentagram and In-house Team\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cooper_hewitt_followup_11.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: Cooper Hewitt Identity by Pentagram and In-house Team\" \/>\n<figcaption>Shopping bags.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The shop&#8217;s main attraction is a no-expenses-spared bag with a deep matte black finish and an awesome liner inside that echoes the physical presence of the museum &#8212; contemporary art inside a 1900s mansion &#8212; by being somewhat serious on the outside but having a party on the inside.

The key takeaway from this campaign is that it&#8217;s undoubtedly Cooper-Hewitt-y, even as it strays away from the more buttoned-up applications so far.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cooper_hewitt_followup_16.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: Cooper Hewitt Identity by Pentagram and In-house Team\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cooper_hewitt_followup_17.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: Cooper Hewitt Identity by Pentagram and In-house Team\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cooper_hewitt_followup_18.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: Cooper Hewitt Identity by Pentagram and In-house Team\" \/>\n<figcaption>Interactive pen, interactin&#8217;.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cooper_hewitt_followup_19.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: Cooper Hewitt Identity by Pentagram and In-house Team\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cooper_hewitt_followup_20.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: Cooper Hewitt Identity by Pentagram and In-house Team\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cooper_hewitt_followup_21.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: Cooper Hewitt Identity by Pentagram and In-house Team\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sample exhibit graphics.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The biggest surprise might be how well the type family works in exhibits, at very large and very small sizes, providing a lot of hierarchy only through weight changes (as opposed to having a serif or other font to help offset the titular font). In some cases, as in the first exhibit image in the block above, it can start to feel a little dry and like &#8220;Do I really have to read <em>all<\/em> this in the same type?&#8221; but it also has a cool industrial appeal.<\/p>\n<blockquote>As part of the revitalization, Pentagram&#8217;s Michael Gericke and his team developed a vibrant system of signage and environmental graphics for the mansion&#8217;s exterior and interior. The program includes the exterior identity, exhibition directories, wayfinding and donor recognition graphics. The Andrew Carnegie Mansion is a historic landmark and cannot be physically altered, so the team found ways to creatively integrate the signage into the building in an impactful but non-intrusive way.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.pentagram.com\/#\/blog\/126869\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pentagram project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cooper_hewitt_followup_22.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: Cooper Hewitt Identity by Pentagram and In-house Team\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cooper_hewitt_followup_23.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: Cooper Hewitt Identity by Pentagram and In-house Team\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cooper_hewitt_followup_24.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: Cooper Hewitt Identity by Pentagram and In-house Team\" \/>\n<figcaption>Exterior signage and graphics.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cooper_hewitt_followup_27.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: Cooper Hewitt Identity by Pentagram and In-house Team\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cooper_hewitt_followup_28.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: Cooper Hewitt Identity by Pentagram and In-house Team\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cooper_hewitt_followup_25.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: Cooper Hewitt Identity by Pentagram and In-house Team\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cooper_hewitt_followup_26.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: Cooper Hewitt Identity by Pentagram and In-house Team\" \/>\n<figcaption>Interior signage and graphics.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The graphics and signage are all great. I especially like the inside instances where the white frames are attached to the walls of the mansion, creating this great contrast of materials and color &#8212; the &#8220;thank you&#8221; wall is particularly beautiful. On the outside, the logo that shoots out of the fence is a great articulation of the challenge of having a modern-day museum housed in a landmark location where you can&#8217;t touch <em>anything<\/em>. It also reminds me of <a href=\"http:\/\/static2.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/13927\/324489-73342-t-1000.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p class=\"end\">Overall, this is really great work and it&#8217;s nice to see a follow-up story that looks at the application over the course of nearly two years. My prognosis remains the same too: Cooper Hewitt is placing all its bets on their typeface, with absolutely everything typeset in it. As far as I&#8217;m concerned, it&#8217;s hot. And I will amend one part: But it might grow tiresome (and dull) after a <strong>long<\/strong> while, if it keeps up keeping up as it has so far.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Back in June of 2014, we reviewed the new logo and very beginnings of the identity for Cooper Hewitt by Pentagram partner Eddie Opara in preparation for the museum&apos;s reopening in December of that year after six years of renovations&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[63,10,26],"tags":[45,327,115,134,654],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4863"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4863"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4863\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4863"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4863"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4863"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
