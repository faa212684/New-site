For those who just don&#8217;t want to deal with it, there are <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Professional_Employer_Organization\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Professional Employer Organizations<\/a> (PEOs) that can be contracted to run these tasks. Among the most popular of these PEOs is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.trinet.com\" target==\"_blank\">TriNet<\/a>, a California based company established in 1988, that recently acquired another PEO, Gevity, to become the second largest provider. Last month, TriNet <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.trinet.com\/?p=241\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">introduced a new identity<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>In terms of the new logo, the bright blue color indicates a sense of optimism and approachability, while the orange touches on TriNet&#8217;s history of innovation. TriNet&#8217;s wingmark symbol itself is a representation of the company&#8217;s new tagline, designed to show forward movement, direction and progress in TriNet&#8217;s business and that of its clients. It also embodies the company&#8217;s brand personality of being &#8220;driven&#8221; while still being attentive to the needs of its clients. The three shapes used to create the wingmark represent the three-way relationship TriNet represents: TriNet as an employer of record, its clients and their employees.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.trinet.com\/about_us\/news_and_press\/press_releases\/pr_new_identity.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press Release<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/trinet_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"TriNet Logo, Detail\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Except for the humongous &#8220;e&#8221; in the new logo, every element has received a nice upgrade. The most notable change is the addition of the &#8220;wingmark&#8221; icon, which is a simple and sophisticated animal in flight that is both strong and delicate. It replace the generic triangle from the previous and helped reduce the logo from a 4-color application to 2 colors. The previous wordmark in FF Meta was actually quite nice and I wouldn&#8217;t have minded if they had stayed with it, but I do like the more extended wordmark in the new logo, but that &#8220;e&#8221; really takes up too much space and demands too much attention and it&#8217;s flaring a tad more than necessary. Nonetheless, it&#8217;s a refreshing redesign that takes TriNet out of the 1990s and into the 2010s.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"red\">Update:<\/span> The identity was designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.interbrand.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Interbrand<\/a>.<\/strong><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_20091013_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_20091013_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_20091013_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_20091013_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,36,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/946"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=946"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/946\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=946"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=946"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=946"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
