Inside a 5,500-square-feet space, the brewery, instead of offering a core range of beers and a few seasonal novelties, is constantly creating and offering new beers that span the full gamut, from sours to saisons to, obviously, IPAs. The identity for Original Pattern Brewing Company was designed by San Francisco, CA-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.play.studio\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Play<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>Play partnered with Original Pattern Brewing Company to create something that could grow, evolve, and reflect the spirit of a company committed to constant flavor experimentation. The Original Pattern name was the genesis of the system, made of consistent elements that rearrange, rotate, expand and contract. Every new brew has a different typeface, color, and pattern based on its taste, the hops it uses, and, of course, its name.<\/blockquote><h3>Play provided text<\/h3>\n<p>(Project photography by <a href=\"http:\/\/ericlouishaines.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Eric Louis Haines<\/a>.

This is the kind of logo most clients would avoid for being hard to read and hard to use but if there is anyone that can pull it off is a hip brewery. Typeset exclusively in <a href=\"https:\/\/neubauladen.com\/product\/nb-international-pro\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NB International\u2122 Pro<\/a>, the logo features one word per concentric circle, literally drawing you into a rabbit hole of beer. It&#8217;s not exactly a pleasant logo but it&#8217;s &#8212; to use a common word in their beer names &#8212; hella cool. The logo can then reduce into a repeating acronym in concentric circles, then in a single circle, and finally into a string of &#8220;O&#8221;s, which is the only unconvincing version. What I like the most is how it maintains the same font size across all variations and also how they can all be used together to form a pattern.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/original_pattern_brewing_logo_pattern.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Original Pattern Brewing Company by Play\" \/>\n<figcaption>Pattern.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/original_pattern_brewing_cans_group.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Original Pattern Brewing Company by Play\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/original_pattern_brewing_cans_group_angle.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Original Pattern Brewing Company by Play\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/original_pattern_brewing_cans_group_closeup.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Original Pattern Brewing Company by Play\" \/>\n<figcaption>Cans, group.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The cans are split into halves, with one side being the &#8220;brand&#8221; side and featuring the logos and other company information all in NB International, and the other side featuring typographic interpretations &#8212; using different fonts &#8212; of the beer names and styles. Some are literal and some are abstract, some are funny and some are serious, some are obvious and some are head-scratchers.
