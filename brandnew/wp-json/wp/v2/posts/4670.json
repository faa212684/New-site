You set the price, you promote it, and if it sells ten or more, it will go into production. It&#8217;s a little like <a href=\"https:\/\/cottonbureau.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cotton Bureau<\/a> but without the curated entry. Mercht comes from the prolific team of Leeds, UK-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.awesomemerchandise.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Awesome Merchandise<\/a>, whose identity we <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/new_logo_and_identity_for_awesome_merchandise_by_robot_food.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reviewed<\/a> almost a year ago to the date. Mercht&#8217;s new identity brings their team back together with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.robot-food.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Robot Food<\/a>, who also designed Awesome Merchandise.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>Robot Food designed the identity using a striking red, yellow and blue colour palette. The new custom logotype flows with a sense of freedom, bringing the &#8216;print for the people&#8217; ethos to fresh, friendly life. Alongside these sit a new suite of branded illustrations and eye-catching icons. These communicate the nuts and bolts of the service, and help promote the brand&#8217;s vision of democratic design, open to all.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.robot-food.com\/work\/mercht\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Robot Food project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mercht_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Mercht by Robot Food\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mercht_logo_monogram.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Mercht by Robot Food\" \/>\n<figcaption>Monogram.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The new logo is in the popular style of monoweight script wordmarks, of which I am a fan in general and this one doesn&#8217;t disappoint&#8230; except for the &#8220;M&#8221;. There is something not capital-y enough about it or maybe it&#8217;s the elongated left leg that opens up the counterspace too much. Its awkwardness is accentuated in the monogram version where the @-like symbol doesn&#8217;t quite stand up on its own. But &#8220;ercht&#8221; is beautiful!<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mercht_icons.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Mercht by Robot Food\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icons.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mercht_pattern.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Mercht by Robot Food\" \/>\n<figcaption>Pattern.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The identity relies heavily on the pattern above, which is kind of gratuitous but since I&#8217;m a sucker for this kind of 1980s &#8211; 90s abstract-shape, Trapper-Keeper-like pattern I happen to enjoy it.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mercht_stuff_all.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Mercht by Robot Food\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mercht_stuff_all_detail.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Mercht by Robot Food\" \/>\n<figcaption>Various materials.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mercht_stickers.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Mercht by Robot Food\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stickers.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mercht_notebook.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Mercht by Robot Food\" \/>\n<figcaption>Notebook.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mercht_lapel_pins.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Mercht by Robot Food\" \/>\n<figcaption>Pins.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mercht_bags.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Mercht by Robot Food\" \/>\n<figcaption>Bags.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mercht_tshirts.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Mercht by Robot Food\" \/>\n<figcaption>T-shirt.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">In application, Awesome Merchandise&#8217;s own capabilities come nicely into play with an over abundance of stickers and pins that make the identity look like a non-stop party. We haven&#8217;t seen much of the primary red-yellow-blue color palette in other projects in a while so it&#8217;s amusing to see it again and it feels kind of fresh. The @-&#8220;M&#8221; is the one distracting element, especially in the bags, as it doesn&#8217;t feel integrated with the pattern; it&#8217;s like they just swept some of the wiggles out and placed the &#8220;M&#8221; in there. Nonetheless, a very designer-friendly identity that also feels accessible to help attract a more mainstream audience.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Launched last month, Mercht is a new platform for designing, selling, and printing t-shirts (and other wearables) with little to no risk.
