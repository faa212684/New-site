After initially appearing in several small television parts as a child actor, he decided to attend culinary school at the age of 18. He has since worked at a variety of British restaurants, including the Michelin-starred Rhodes in the Square and Adlards. With his wife Beth, he opened the gastropub The Hand &amp; Flowers in 2005 and within a year gained his first Michelin star. In the 2012 list, he won a second Michelin star, the first time a pub had done so. As a chef he has appeared on the Great British Menu, MasterChef and Saturday Kitchen. Kerridge currently presents <em>Food and Drink<\/em> (2015-present) and presented <em>Bake Off: Cr\u00e8me de la Cr\u00e8me<\/em> (2016), both for BBC Two.&#8221; (<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tom_Kerridge\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wikipedia<\/a>)<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tom_kerridge_logo.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Tom Kerridge by The Clearing\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tom_kerridge_knives_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Tom Kerridge by The Clearing\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tom_kerridge_knives_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Tom Kerridge by The Clearing\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tom_kerridge_knives_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Tom Kerridge by The Clearing\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tom_kerridge_knives_04.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Tom Kerridge by The Clearing\" \/>\n<figcaption>Knives. Interesting note on the handles: &#8220;The Denim Micarta handles on the knives are truly unique and the material was introduced purely for Tom&#8217;s range. The material is made from denim that has been compressed under extreme pressure and makes for an eye-catching finish that will wear beautifully with time. Micarta is the term used for the compression of layer upon layer of fibre which is combined with resin to produce a new material capable of being reshaped and is hard wearing.&#8221;<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tom_kerridge_products.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Tom Kerridge by The Clearing\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tom_kerridge_products_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Tom Kerridge by The Clearing\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tom_kerridge_products_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Tom Kerridge by The Clearing\" \/>\n<figcaption>Product range.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"&quot;Tom Kerridge is a professional English chef who has worked mainly in the United Kingdom.
