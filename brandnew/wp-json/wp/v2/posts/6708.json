It runs free of charge programmes of mentoring, internships, university application support (including trips to universities and help with personal statements, aptitude tests and interviews) and career and skills workshops to support young people through their sixth-form and university years. Currently taking on a new cohort of over 1,600 young people every year, the SMF has offices in Birmingham, Glasgow, Liverpool, London, Manchester and Newcastle and runs residential programmes for young people from the Isle of Wight to the Western Isles of Scotland across 11 career sectors (Accountancy, Architecture, Banking &amp; Finance, Biology &amp; Chemistry, Business, Engineering &amp; Physics, Law, Media &amp; Communications, Medicine, Politics, and Technology). The SMF also runs what is believed to be the world&#8217;s only Social Mobility Employer Index, which ranks the country&#8217;s top employers on the actions they take to ensure they are open to talent from all backgrounds.&#8221;<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/social_mobility_foundation_old_look.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Social Mobility Foundation by Jones Knowles Ritchie\" \/>\n<figcaption>Samples of old identity.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/social_mobility_foundation_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Social Mobility Foundation by Jones Knowles Ritchie\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/social_mobility_foundation_video.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Social media content.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/social_mobility_foundation_posters.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Social Mobility Foundation by Jones Knowles Ritchie\" \/>\n<figcaption>Posters.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/social_mobility_foundation_new_look.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Social Mobility Foundation by Jones Knowles Ritchie\" \/>\n<figcaption>New identity.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"(Est. 2006) &quot;The Social Mobility Foundation (SMF) is a charity which aims to make practical improvement in social mobility for young people from low-income backgrounds.
