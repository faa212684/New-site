Still a leader today in the &#8220;white goods&#8221; (major household appliances), the company currently offers a line of appliances which include refrigerators, freezers, dishwashers, washing machines, dryers, microwaves, air conditioners, and both gas and electric stoves.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/frigidaire_crest.jpg\" alt=\"Frigidaire\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Early crown logo embedded with &#8220;F&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>The very first electric refrigerator was introduced in 1913, but in 1915, designer Alfred Mellowes created a new version and in 1916 he founded the Guardian Frigerator Company to manufacture his invention. Each refrigerator was handmade, and took over a week to assemble. Consequently, in less than two years his company had lost over $30,000 and was nearly bankrupt. Entrepreneur William C. Durant, the founder of General Motors, saw the potential of Mellowes&#8217; creation and bought the company in 1918. He immediately renamed the firm Frigidaire. It was at that time that the original crown logo with the embedded &#8220;F&#8221; was created, but shortly after the acquisition, Durant commissioned a typographic variation which was more in line with the style being used for the General Motors logo. In addition, the phrase &#8220;Product of General Motors&#8221; was added to the mark.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/frigidaire_script_logo_original.jpg\" alt=\"Frigidaire\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Introduction of the script logo in 1955.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/frigidaire_brochures.jpg\" alt=\"Frigidaire\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Samples of Frigidaire and GM brochures.

Until that time the company created numerous manuals and brochures, but after the acquisition, the Frigidaire mark all but disappeared.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/frigidaire_crown_logo.jpg\" alt=\"Frigidaire\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">1986 crown logo, above. Other logos, years unknown, below.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/frigidaire_logos_more.gif\" alt=\"Frigidaire\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In 1986, Westinghouse became a subsidiary of Sweden&#8217;s Electrolux, and Frigidaire was reintroduced and repositioned as a premium brand featuring European styling and high-performance features; it was at this time that the first stainless steel offerings were introduced. Under the direction of longtime Electrolux executive Hans G. Backman, Frigidaire underwent a visual makeover as well, which included a new crown logo.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/frigidaire_script_new.gif\" alt=\"Frigidaire\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Hello again, script logo.<\/p>\n<p>In 2001, in an effort to celebrate the heritage of the Frigidaire brand while introducing an entirely new line of products, Electrolux took the logical step of bringing back a version of the original logo. And in 2006 the logo was once again redesigned to commemorate the company&#8217;s 90th anniversary. Most recently, Frigidaire underwent yet another logo redesign. According to their press materials:<\/p>\n<blockquote>&#8220;Frigidaire will unveil a boldfaced new logo and look to celebrate the introduction of 250 new appliances with specific time-saving features engineered to help mothers spend less time doing routine housework and more time doing what they love. The appliance leader stands behind its claim, offering a &#8220;More Me-Time&#8221; Guarantee: moms will save a minimum of eight hours a month by using a combination of select Frigidaire time-saving appliances or they can return them for a refund of their purchase price.&#8221; <\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/frigidaire_badge.jpg\" alt=\"Frigidaire\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/frigidaire_ad.jpg\" alt=\"Frigidaire\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">New logo applications.<\/p>\n<p>Sadly, the new logo is bereft of both the script typography and the crown; it now features a fairly derivative triangle tucked into the letterforms in place of the letter &#8220;a.&#8221; The triangle icon has been seen many, many times before, two examples that quickly come to mind are the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bass.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bass Ale<\/a> identity and the <a href=\"http:\/\/images.google.com\/images?rls=en&#038;q=Silence%3DDeath\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Silence=Death<\/a> logo for the organization Act Up.<\/p>\n<p>What is saddest still is viewing the logo in color. The placement of the red triangle results in breaking the word Frigidaire into two separate words: Frigid and Ire. Given that these products are specifically marketed to moms, this messaging system is likely not going to appeal to anyone.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to Alex Nardi for the tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_20091019_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_20091019_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"574\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,51,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/950"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=950"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/950\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=950"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=950"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=950"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
