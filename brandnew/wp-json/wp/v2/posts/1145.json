Long associated with Hollywood, the name\/term\/idea of Technicolor went from having the kind of service-specific equity that Google now has in search engines or Kleenex in facial tissues; this past decade however, Technicolor seemed to have gone astray. It was bought by French tech company Thomson in 2001 and the Technicolor name became a simple subsidiary. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.variety.com\/article\/VR1118014337.html?categoryId=1009&#038;cs=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">In a 180-degree-turn-of-events<\/a>, this past January, Thomson announced that it would change its corporate name to Technicolor and give it back the consumer-facing reign. Today, Technicolor is a machine of technological proportions, providing services in animation, digital effects, production, post-production, and more. Both Thomson and Technicolor have adopted a new logo, designed by Technicolor&#8217;s Marketing Branding team with advertising agency <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gyrohsr.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gyro:HSR<\/a>.<!--more--><blockquote>The new logo symbolizes a departure from our old heritage to a new dynamic platform that celebrates all of our employees&#8217; genius and contributions. It symbolizes how we change people&#8217;s lives throughout the world with innovative products and services. The new logo reflects the importance of dimension, the entire color spectrum, and key elements of light, movement and sound in a dynamic and balanced composition.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.technicolor.com\/en\/hi\/about-technicolor\/technicolor-news\/all-news-articles\/2010\/technicolor-awarded-best-new-logo-for-2010\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press Release<\/a> after winning &#8220;best new logo award by the Business Marketing Association (BMA) of New York City&#8221;<\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/technicolor_explanation.gif\" alt=\"Technicolor\" \/><\/p>\n<p>For some reason I associated the old logo more with NBC than with Technicolor, as the film reel reminded me of the peacock. But I digress. The new logo is interesting, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s necessarily great or innovative, but there is an interesting tension to it from the &#8220;hanging&#8221; strips of color, like paint waiting to spill over. For Fourcolorphobics, this logo is a nightmare, as it only works in full color &mdash; a single color version with shades of gray probably looks dumb. From the image above, it looks like there is some rationalization that has to do with &#8220;stages,&#8221; but I wasn&#8217;t able to find anything on it, so decipher as you will.<p>\n<p>The typography is inconspicuous, it doesn&#8217;t attract too much attention and it doesn&#8217;t detract, so all things considered, it&#8217;s fairly good. Most importantly, the new logo allows the company to stand for all kinds of technologies, not just film, which the old logo pigeonholed it into.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/technicolor_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"Technicolor\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to Jeremy Herlakian for first tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_100709_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_100709_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_100709_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_100709_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,26,88],"tags":[113,165,246,42,247],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1145"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1145"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1145\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1145"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1145"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1145"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
