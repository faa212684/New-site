This past July, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yourlogomakesmebarf.com\/2009\/07\/wtf-wisconsin\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">when YLMMB added the logo of the Wisconsin Tourism Federation<\/a> (WTF) to its list of victims &mdash; along with the inevitable post title of &#8220;WTF Wisconsin?! &mdash; the change was set in motion. Yesterday, Milwaukee&#8217;s <em>Journal Sentinel<\/em> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jsonline.com\/entertainment\/62997292.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reported<\/a> that WTF had changed its logo to avoid the now infamous acronym of the words &#8220;What&#8221;, &#8220;The,&#8221; and &#8220;Fuck.&#8221; From now on they are to be known as the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.witourismfederation.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tourism Federation of Wisconsin<\/a> (TFW) with a logo to match. Besides the question of why not fix their visually painful logo while they are at it, I can&#8217;t help but point out this missed opportunity: If web lingo has taken you down, embrace it and change it from   Wisconsin Tourism Federation to, say, Federation of Tourism of Wisconsin.
