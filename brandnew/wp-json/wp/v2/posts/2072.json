Try to pronounce it. Suuhhfffhhn. Rolls off deep of your sternum, no? Shut up, I know it&#8217;s pronounced S [breathe] F. Anyway. With the new name, SF has introduced a new logo and on-air package designed by Sydney-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.inkproject.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ink Project<\/a> that will begin rollout at the end of August.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sf_channel_logo_detail.jpg\" alt=\"SF Channel Logo and On-Air\" \/><\/p>\n<blockquote>The SF rebrand will be supported with a new tagline &#8220;we are sci fi&#8221; and a revolving set of &#8220;we are&hellip;&#8221; descriptors that have been developed to showcase the rich choice of content on the channel. [&hellip;] An inspiring suite of SF idents have been designed by Ink Project to entice and energise the viewer with cinematic imagery and a broad spectrum of interesting characters. Each character holds a distinctive point of difference, reflecting the depth of genres available on SF. <\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe src=\"http:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/46410312?portrait=0\" width=\"574\" height=\"323\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">On-air graphics montage.<\/p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/46410109?portrait=0\" width=\"574\" height=\"323\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">30-second brand spot.<\/p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/46410917?portrait=0\" width=\"574\" height=\"323\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">One of various character idents. See all <a href=\"http:\/\/www.inkproject.com\/news\/entry\/sci-fi-rebrands-to-sf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The old logo&hellip; well, we all liked the old logo and already mourned its death once; it seems too zombie-ish to kill it again. The new logo looks like a combination of the new Syfy identity and its competitor, Discovery&#8217;s SCIENCE &mdash; yes, all caps (see <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/meet_morph.php\">here<\/a> for a refresher). It takes the purple-y, groovy feel of the former and then crams it into a nondescript orb that does stuff. It pulsates. It opens to reveal what appears to be the best disco party ever. It peels and rotates. It&#8217;s a fun thing when it animates but static, and it does stay put quite a bit, it&#8217;s odd, with a sliced section. And I still have to mention the very odd typography in said orb. It&#8217;s like two different races of aliens came together to form a wordmark. The &#8220;S&#8221; is from one planet and the &#8220;f&#8221; or &#8220;F&#8221; &mdash; who knows?! &mdash; is from another planet. I could say another galaxy, but they are still both sans serives. In their defense, they do evolve from the old logo.<\/p>\n<p>And in defense of the project, the on-air graphics and personality come to the rescue of the logo. Specially the character idents, which are equally creepy and awesome. The supporting typography has a great feel too, edgy and airy; I sort of wish something like it would have played out in the logo. And, finally, perhaps a little something you didn&#8217;t know about me: I like purple. A lot. So all this purple tinting and purple auras and purple pulsations I like. A lot. Overall, despite my lack of excitement about the logo on its own, this is a fun redesign that keeps within the confines of what we expect a science channel to look like in 2012.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sf_channel_biz_card.jpg\" alt=\"SF Channel Logo and On-Air\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sf_channel_ads.jpg\" alt=\"SF Channel Logo and On-Air\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sf_channel_ads_02.jpg\" alt=\"SF Channel Logo and On-Air\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Project spotted on <a href=\"http:\/\/brandingsource.blogspot.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Branding Source<\/a>.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_120806_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_120806_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_120806_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_120806_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,66,26],"tags":[294,476,509,189],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2072"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2072"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2072\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2072"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2072"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2072"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
