Global Pulse&#8217;s vision is to &#8220;Close the information gap between the onset of a global crisis and the availability of actionable information for decision makers&#8221; and its mission to &#8220;Harness innovation to protect the vulnerable.&#8221; To accompany the launch of the new name, New York-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.zagollc.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Zago<\/a> created a new identity.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>The Globe emblem represents the organization&#8217;s vision of harnessing innovation to create a world without vulnerable populations. It draws inspiration from the following concepts: connection, data, innovation, velocity, overlap.<br \/>&mdash; Graphic Standards<\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/global_pulse_globe_detail.gif\" alt=\"Global Pulse\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The new icon is a representation of, indeed, a globe pulsing. When I first saw it my reaction was that it was too symmetric (<em>tri<\/em>mmetric?), with the three ripples being the same size and wondered if it would look better with small, medium and big ripples representing different kinds of pulses from around the world. But the resulting icon does provide a lovely resolution in the ripples connecting at the two outer rims, which is a nice visual metaphor for what the organization is trying to do. It&#8217;s also nice that there is no shading involved and, when seen small, the icon portrays dimension. Imagine that. It can be achieved. The typography is bold and simple, set in the ever trusted Trade Gothic Bold Condensed.<\/p>\n<p>Along with this week&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/globally_speeching.php\">International Year of Youth logo<\/a> it looks like a trend might be starting of the UN being a patron of good design.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/global_pulse_stationery.gif\" alt=\"Global Pulse\" \/><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_100806_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_100806_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"574\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,79,26],"tags":[114,283,291],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1167"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1167"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1167\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1167"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1167"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1167"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
