And, by heavens, is that logo ready for 2007 primetime! As an identity that will live 99.99% of its time in online and on-screen applications this new identity excels as a nebulous-abstract-who-cares-what-it-is piece of eye candy that should at least position Silverlight as the media application of the future. (Despite its almost-ten-years-in-the-making ubiquity, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.adobe.com\/products\/flashplayer\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Adobe&#8217;s Flash Player is looking a tad tired<\/a>.) While the Blobby Ball of Nebulousness&trade; keeps my eyes affixed to it, I can&#8217;t help but be broken out from its spell by the faux Myriad typeface used for the name &mdash; why Microsoft can&#8217;t opt for good typography has always baffled me &mdash; Gotham, Futura, Helvetica, anything but this would make their design stand out so much more. Wait&mdash; what&#8217;s that? Mmmmm&hellip; Nebulousness.
