The company offers over 20 bottled juices and has nine locations across California where you can get your juices made in real time. This past November, along with the opening of a new store in San Francisco, Project Juice introduced a new logo and packaging designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/news.chendesign.com\/cda-news\/2014\/11\/13project-juice-valencia-street-opening\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Chen Design Associates<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/project_juice_old_look.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Project Juice by Chen Design Associates\" \/>\n<figcaption>A sampling of the previous packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>You can see plenty more sample of the old look (and new look <em>and<\/em> old-old look) on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/projectjuice\/photos_stream\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">their Facebook photos<\/a>, which provides a nice visual timeline of the brand evolution.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/project_juice_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Project Juice by Chen Design Associates\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The previous logo wasn&#8217;t very inspired, showing a contour of the bottle that the juices come in and a basic condensed sans serif. It wasn&#8217;t offensive or ugly, just slightly generic. The new logo has a great crafted feel to it with some inventive custom lettering that gives a lot of personality to each of the characters &mdash; that &#8220;C&#8221; is pretty great. The icon is a &#8220;PJ&#8221; monogram that makes the shape of a carrot; it&#8217;s a little forced and starts to look slightly futuristic or like it belongs on a cycling team but it makes for a great accent to the wordmark.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/project_juice_packaging_detail.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Project Juice by Chen Design Associates\" \/>\n<figcaption>New packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/project_juice_packaging_detail_closer.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Project Juice by Chen Design Associates\" \/>\n<figcaption>A few other bottles.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/project_juice_packaging_individuals.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Project Juice by Chen Design Associates\" \/>\n<figcaption>And some more bottles.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/project_juice_store_sign.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Project Juice by Chen Design Associates\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/project_juice_store_inside.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Project Juice by Chen Design Associates\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/project_juice_store_menu_board.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Project Juice by Chen Design Associates\" \/>\n<figcaption>New store.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/project_juice_smoothies.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Project Juice by Chen Design Associates\" \/>\n<figcaption>Smoothies.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">The new packaging is a great update with the new logo and updated typography that introduces a good-looking slab serif into the mix. Another small change that makes a big difference was switching from white caps on the bottle to yellow caps, giving the bottles a sparkier and more custom-looking top. And, as always with juice products, it&#8217;s the color and texture of the product itself that really sells the design and this one does it with cold-pressed precision.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Launched in 2012 with the help of a successful Kickstarter campaign, Project Juice is a micro-juicery based in San Francisco, CA, offering certified organic, cold-pressed juices made with produce from local farmers who practice sustainable farming methods.
