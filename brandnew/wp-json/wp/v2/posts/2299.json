A wider view (and longer reporting in Portuguese can be found <a href=\"http:\/\/videos.sapo.pt\/bj9Fzi30JSZRycunUWnB\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a>).<\/p>\n<blockquote>The concept behind the new visual identity of the brand &#8220;is based on the idea of overcoming,&#8221; to &#8220;encourage consumers to make things differently, make things better for them, better for the world around them, putting people at the heart of innovation.&#8221; For MyBrand, the new logo has a &#8220;great synthesis&#8221;: &#8220;No attempt was with the letters readability, we tried a new language, something that is perceived as new and unique, something inspiring [&hellip;] In addition, each letter was associated an idea: Community &#8211; M; Communication &#8211; E; World &#8211; O.

It is extremely simple without going for the fully geometric straightforward approach that this could have gone in. Instead it creates an interesting tension and balance of its own kind by tilting the sticks of the &#8220;M&#8221; and &#8220;E&#8221;. I absolutely hate the whole alien language\/alien inscription approach that you can see on their website and perpetrated in the video below. I think the same logo could have been taken into a more lively and engaging identity rather than this half-baked sci-fi approach. Just goes to demonstrate how important identity and message is to the logo. (Of course we should all know <em>that<\/em> but it&#8217;s good to have reminders now and then).<\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"574\" height=\"323\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/qETBHUlz5xE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">A rather strange campaign that focuses on the logo as &#8220;strange markings&#8221; and an American reporter travels to Portugal to understand them.
