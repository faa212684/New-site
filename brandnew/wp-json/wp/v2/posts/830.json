Operating since then under the snoozy name of MLS Philadelphia 2010, the team finally unveiled its new name and identity yesterday in front of Philadelphia&#8217;s historic City Hall: <a href=\"http:\/\/philadelphiaunion.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Philadelphia Union<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/philly_union_unveil.jpg\" alt=\"Philadelphia Union Logo, Narrative\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Team owner Jay Sugarman, left, and mayor of Philadelphia, Michael Nutter unveil the new logo at City Hall.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The new logo, designed by New Haven, Connecticut based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.silvermangroup.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Silverman Group<\/a>, is soaked in American history:<\/p>\n<blockquote>Union references the original Thirteen Colonies, which established the foundation of the United States of America. The club&#8217;s colors are navy blue and gold, symbolizing the uniforms of the American Continental Army, accented by the lighter shade of blue found in the Philadelphia Flag. The primary symbol of a rattlesnake is derived from Ben Franklin&#8217;s political cartoons and was featured in multiple editions of the <em>Pennsylvania Gazette<\/em> during the 1750s. The rattlesnake was utilized to emphasize the necessity of colonial unity and serve as a reminder of the danger of disunity. Franklin&#8217;s rattlesnake gained enormous popularity and evolved into a primary symbol of the American Revolution.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/philadelphiaunion.com\/uploads\/Press_16.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press Release (PDF)<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/philly_union_franklin.gif\" alt=\"Benjamin Franklin's Join, or Die Cartoon\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Benjamin Franklin&#8217;s <em>Join, or Die<\/em> political cartoon, published in 1754 in the <em>Pennsylvania Gazette<\/em>.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/philly_union_narrative.jpg\" alt=\"Philadelphia Union Logo, Narrative\" \/><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s almost as if they are daring Americans <em>not<\/em> to like it and expose how unpatriotic they are. Not really. But I just haven&#8217;t seen a logo that goes to the extent of this one to reach into its history. What&#8217;s nice is that the logo becomes a symbol of what Philadelphia is known for and avoids using landmarks or other specific cliches. And the execution of the logo is actually quite nice and effective as a soccer crest; the snake might reduce to a worm-like figure on small applications, even on the secondary logo, so maybe we will soon see a snake-focused graphic that helps avoid that. Overall, a nice and strong emblem.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/river.unit-e.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">River Brandon<\/a> for first tip.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[12,26,87],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/830"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=830"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/830\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=830"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=830"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=830"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
