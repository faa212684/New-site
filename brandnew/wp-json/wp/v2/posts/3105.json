Now, I bet that&#8217;s an industry you hadn&#8217;t even considered. (I hadn&#8217;t). To clarify: it&#8217;s not a service provider of luxury shuttle service but a seller of these buses to companies that may have a use for such a vehicle. After plant relocations and a bankruptcy, Krystal&#8217;s bus operation assets were purchased by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.enconline.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ElDorado National<\/a>, a manufacturer of commercial buses. Looking to create some distance from previous ownership but recognizing that its name had equity in the industry, Krystal introduced a completely reinvented identity designed by Wichita, KS-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gardnerdesign.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gardner Design<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/krystal_buses.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Krystal by Gardner Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Krystal&#8217;s bus models.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The new mark is a throwback to the original source of power for multi-passenger coaches &mdash; the horse. And this thoroughbred represents strength as well as prestige. Its faceted, crystal structure is not merely a play on words; it is indicative of the brand&#8217;s high-end products and service, as well as the company&#8217;s dedication to transparent business practices.<br \/><br \/>The wordmark is important because it provides linkage to the former brand. The custom face creates symmetry with an inverted Y and A. It connotes a sense of style and high readability that is easily scalable; and within it appears a small nod to the name itself.<br \/><br \/>The new color palette gives a sense of regality without being flashy. It is fresh and modern, and breathes new life into the bus manufacturing industry&#8217;s visual landscape.<\/blockquote><h3>Provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/krystal_logo_detail.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Krystal by Gardner Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/krystal_logo_detail_alternate.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Krystal by Gardner Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Alternate lock-up and background.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>There is nothing nice to say about the previous logo other than the icon was symmetric. The new one clearly establishes a new kind of company with a renewed sense of pride in its products with the choice of a strong horse that also alludes to the vintage and romantic charm of riding around in a carriage coach. The faceted execution of the horse and the gold color give it a diamond-like quality that appropriately represents the product it&#8217;s selling: luxurious, opulent, attention-grabbing. The wordmark is a little odd. Okay, maybe plenty odd with the flipped &#8220;Y&#8221; as an &#8220;A&#8221; and the protruding &#8220;R&#8221; &mdash; without those extra maneuvers it would have been a perfectly acceptable, simple wordmark.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/krystal_business_card_and_pattern.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Krystal by Gardner Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business card and pattern.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/krystaL_cup_mug.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Krystal by Gardner Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Mug and cap.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/krystal_ads.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Krystal by Gardner Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Ads.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/krystal_bus_livery.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Krystal by Gardner Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>A bus decked in the identity.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">In application, there is a gold-hued faceted pattern that is not very different from other faceted patterns we&#8217;ve seen but I think it works well here and feels like the right amount of restrained opulence needed to sell luxury passenger buses. When I see the ads and applications above I keep thinking of Las Vegas and people with money being douchey. So, as weird a compliment as that may sound like, that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s meant as. The design works for the industry and end-consumer and Gardner has done it with commendable restraint and proper execution.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1996 in Salina, Kansas, Krystal (formerly Krystal Koach) is a manufacturer and seller of luxury passenger buses.
