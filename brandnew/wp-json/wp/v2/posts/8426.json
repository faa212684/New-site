Named after the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.visitmexico.com\/en\/main-destinations\/guerrero\/acapulco\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">beach-side city<\/a> in Mexico where the sport was invented in 1969 by Enrique Corcuera, APC builds on the growing popularity of the sport in Europe with a rare, dedicated space to padel, and in a premium setting to boot. The identity for APC has been designed by Stockholm, Sweden-based <a href=\"https:\/\/bedow.se\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bedow<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>As Acapulco is the place where Padel was born, it felt appropriate that it should also be the name of Sweden&#8217;s first premium Padel brand. The visual identity pays homage to the celebrated Mexican beach resort while referencing the sport&#8217;s distinctive bat designs.<br \/><br \/>The Acapulco word mark is written in a custom typeface composed entirely from punched holes that echo the negative space in Padel bats. Complementing this core element is a dotted monogram, hole-punched icons and pictograms and a series of accent colours chosen to marry with a signature blue found on the standard Padel court.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/bedow.se\/work\/acapulco-padel-club\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bedow project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/acapulco_logo_a.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Acapulco Padel &amp; Club by Bedow\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/acapulco_monogram.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Acapulco Padel &amp; Club by Bedow\" \/>\n<figcaption>Monogram.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/acapulco_balls_to_logo_animation_b.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Balls\/monogram animation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Referencing the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=padel+rackets&#038;safe=active&#038;source=lnms&#038;tbm=isch&#038;sa=X&#038;ved=2ahUKEwi8rIOk3bznAhVyw1kKHQswDtgQ_AUoAnoECBMQBA&#038;biw=1258&#038;bih=847\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hole patterns in padel rackets<\/a>, the wordmark is a beautiful, custom, italic, slab serif, dotted concoction that is totally unexpected and amazingly manages to capture a key element of the sport and feel like a premium sports venue. I love how the letters even have a thick-and-thin contrast with the left sides having two dots &#8212; a feat that is especially impressive in the curved letters. The &#8220;PADEL &amp; CLUB&#8221; type underneath could have been better integrated somehow, perhaps even just by being a bolder weight. The monogram for APC is lovely too with the dots of the &#8220;A&#8221; and the &#8220;C&#8221; neatly connecting with those of the &#8220;P&#8221; and its zig-saggy composition is quite refreshing.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/acapulco_numerals_01.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Acapulco Padel &amp; Club by Bedow\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/acapulco_numerals_02.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Acapulco Padel &amp; Club by Bedow\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<div class=\"video-container\" style=\"background:black\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/acapulco_numerals_animated.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Numerals.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/acapulco_icon_set.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Acapulco Padel &amp; Club by Bedow\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icon set.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>A whole lot of yes to the numerals &#8212; they would make excellent house number signs punched out of metal or something &#8212; which would also make it tempting to create a full uppercase alphabet in the style but I sort of like that it&#8217;s limited to the logo and the numbers, as it could be too much of a good thing otherwise. A valiant effort on the slanted icons &#8212; they are good and correct but they start to look too cartoony with the slant that feels more exaggerated in these shapes.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/acapulco_business_card.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Acapulco Padel &amp; Club by Bedow\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business card.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/acapulco_water_bottles.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Acapulco Padel &amp; Club by Bedow\" \/>\n<figcaption>Water bottles.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/acapulco_net.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Acapulco Padel &amp; Club by Bedow\" \/>\n<figcaption>Net.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/acapulco_tshirt.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Acapulco Padel &amp; Club by Bedow\" \/>\n<figcaption>T-shirt.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Most applications are pretty straightforward, which makes sense given that the primary elements are so graphic to begin with that not a whole much else is needed. The business card is perhaps a little too dry&#8230; maybe a pop of the tennis-ball-green color would make it feel a little more fun. On the website and the water bottles there is a bold, extended, uppercase, italic sans in use that feels really awkward, like all of a sudden it&#8217;s an F1 racing event, so I&#8217;m not sure where that came from but worth putting it back there.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/acapulco_signage_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Acapulco Padel &amp; Club by Bedow\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/acapulco_signage_04.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Acapulco Padel &amp; Club by Bedow\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/acapulco_signage_05.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Acapulco Padel &amp; Club by Bedow\" \/>\n<figcaption>Signage.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/acapulco_signage_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Acapulco Padel &amp; Club by Bedow\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/acapulco_signage_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Acapulco Padel &amp; Club by Bedow\" \/>\n<figcaption>Super cool sign.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">The signage is super nice as the wordmark, monogram, and numerals lend themselves so well to physical applications given that they can easily be stenciled on anything. Overall, this is a great identity for an establishment that could have easily had a more generic, forgettable sports club look instead of something as surprising and sophisticated as this.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Opened last year, Acapulco Padel &amp; Club (APC) is, as its name half-implies, a padel club in Hisings Backa, a suburb of Gothenburg, Sweden.
