There is a couple aesthetics going on&hellip; it&#8217;s like bank notes meets hipsterism. And it works, with the limited color palette and strong use of white space (and also <em>full<\/em> space).

With a name like that, there is really no way to go but whimsy. While the hand-scribbled script typography could come across as cloying and obvious, small details like adding &#8220;fee&#8221; in wobbly small caps to &#8220;Co.&#8221;, or the &#8220;Est. just now&#8221;, and the peppered coffee cups around it, make it more acerbic. With those giant eyes, the characters could be the stuff of nightmares but with the playful, scribbly line work and humorous approach they become better coffee companions. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/19368801\/Whimsy-Co\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Barba by Negra Nigoevic and Filip Pomykalo<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_barba.jpg\" alt=\"Bar Brutal by Lo Siento\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">Meaning &#8220;uncle, old gentleman, old man, man of the sea, fisherman&#8221; as a Dalmatian colloquialism, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tripadvisor.com\/Restaurant_Review-g295371-d6857537-Reviews-Barba-Dubrovnik_Dubrovnik_Neretva_County_Dalmatia.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Barba<\/a> is a counter-service restaurant in Dubrovnik, Croatia, serving seafood dishes. Designed by Zagreb-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/negra\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Negra Nigoevic<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/FilipPomykalo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Filip Pomykalo<\/a> in collaboration with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/maritabonacic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Marita Bonacic<\/a> for interior design, the identity centers around an abstract uncle, old gentleman, old man, man of the sea, or fisherman with a bushy beard. (I particularly like that in Spanish, &#8220;barba&#8221; means beard). The drawing is charming and extremely expressive even though it lacks an actual face. I love how the waves integrate with the hair\/beard and the pipe drawing is so great. The application is nice, nothing out of this world and there is an attractive set of icons that work really well on the adorning jars of sand. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/18338859\/BARBA-Restaurant\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project here<\/strong><\/a><\/strong>.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"A heavily blue-hued set of work in this centennial edition of Friday Likes with work from Singapore, Sydney, and Zagreb.
