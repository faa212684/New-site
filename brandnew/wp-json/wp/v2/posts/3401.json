Early projects included the Pictograms, the official typeface, a set of sub-brand logos and the interior graphics for the Organising Committee headquarters. We proceeded to work on the full suite of publications, including the Official Ticketing Guide and Spectator Guide before art directing the TV graphics, and developing the creative strategy for the &#8216;Look of Games&#8217; &mdash; the venue dressing, city dressing and sports equipment at Games-time.<\/blockquote><h3>Provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/glasgow_2014_logo.png\" alt=\"New Look of the Games for 2014 Commonwealth Games by Tangent\" \/>\n<figcaption>Event logo, designed by Marque Creative.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The highly forgettable logo was designed by Marque Creative and like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/gold_coast_2018_bursting_at_the_seams.php#.U-ieL41dUuc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">past and future Commonwealth logos<\/a> it wasn&#8217;t particularly good.
