But if you asked me to name one sausage brand I would instantly think of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hebrewnational.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hebrew National<\/a>. Not because I know what it tastes like, but because it has a cool name, a cool slogan &mdash; &#8220;We answer to a higher authority&#8221; &mdash; and it feels like it plays by its own rules, defying mainstream consumption with a kosher product and, again, what would seemingly be a very limiting name. Originally established in 1905 on the Lower East Side in New York City, Hebrew National catered to the city&#8217;s growing Jewish immigrant population, going through various changes over the last hundred years, most recently <a href=\"http:\/\/www.conagrafoods.com\/consumer\/brands\/brand_info.jsp?cookietest=true&#038;page=hebrew_national\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">as part of ConAgra Foods<\/a>. Beyond a good name and story, the product isn&#8217;t bad at all, according to some experts: Last year <em>New York<\/em> magazine asked &uuml;ber restaurateur Danny Meyer (and two other New York power chefs) <a href=\"http:\/\/nymag.com\/guides\/summer\/2009\/57460\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">to rate supermarket hot dogs<\/a> &mdash; described as a &#8220;meatier hot dog&#8221; Hebrew National took the top spot.

The latter was fairly quirky and odd to be a national supermarket product and I guess that&#8217;s part of what makes it so endearing in my view, then it evolved into something less quirky but it still retained the main elements &mdash; neither was great, per se, but it stood out. This last version though, is completely washed out. You could write Honey Graham Crackers, Mac and Cheese, or Corn Flakes in the new typography treatment and it wouldn&#8217;t make a difference. It now looks just like dozens of other products, and if that&#8217;s the price to pay for the growth of a product, then all I can say is oy vey.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.threestepsahead.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Josh Korwin<\/a> for the tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_100520_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_100520_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"574\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,69,26],"tags":[159,53,112],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1104"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1104"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1104\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1104"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1104"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1104"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
