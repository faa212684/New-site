One of the leading auto manufacturers by volume of cars produced and revenue, Toyota is present pretty much all over the world (except for Australia) and employs more than 369,000 people. Its Prius, introduced in 1997, has made Toyota the world&#8217;s market leader in sales of hybrid electric vehicles. In the United States, Toyota is based in Plano, TX, and manages 16 car brands including many popular cars like the 4Runner, Camry, RAV4, and the Tacoma and Tundra pickup trucks. Earlier this year, Toyota introduced a refreshed identity.

It also stands as a symbol to inspire people around the world to go to the places and do the things they&#8217;ve always dreamed of.<br \/><br \/>The staging platform is how we refer to the Toyota emblem when shown in the red surround. The staging platform allows the emblem to be anchored and impactful.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.toyota.com\/brandguidelines\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Toyota brand guidelines<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/toyota_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Toyota\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/toyota_logo_horizontal.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Toyota\" \/>\n<figcaption>Horizontal version.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/toyota_logo_red_1color.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Toyota\" \/>\n<figcaption>1-color versions.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/toyota_logo_variables.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Toyota\" \/>\n<figcaption>Three different uses of the logo: for Toyota, for the tagline, and for individual car brands.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Any time a car manufacture logo loses its chrome skin is a good thing &#8212; the idea that the logo must look like the actual metal badge on a car&#8217;s grill has rarely been flattering for them. Toyota&#8217;s evolution is particularly flattering as the old logo was clunky and didn&#8217;t have the greatest finish. Once you remove the 3D effects the icon, to be honest, isn&#8217;t that great but it looks infinitely better and now at least has a chance to be more interesting beyond another chrome thing. Placing the icon inside a red square gives it a little more presence and weight and pairing it with the black wordmark creates a logo with more impact. Even the 1-color versions look pretty convincing and make the icon stand out quite nicely. Its flexibility to accommodate the tagline or the individual car brands works quite well. Before this redesign I had never given the Toyota logo a second thought but this new approach gives it a somewhat elevated presence that I never associated with Toyota.<\/p>\n<blockquote>The Toyota Visual Identity System currently comprises six core elements that help unify and communicate our brands with consistency and clarity. They include our logos, the <em>Let&#8217;s Go Places <\/em>tagline, the Toyota typography, photography styles, color palette and design layouts. Together they help convey the Toyota visual brand identity.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.toyota.com\/brandguidelines\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Toyota brand guidelines<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/toyota_identity_elements.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Toyota\" \/>\n<figcaption>Identity elements.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>Typography provides a strong, unifying element and can help convey a consistent brand voice across various marketing communications.
