While this is mostly self-indulgent in the best of ways &#8212; if you are going to design for yourself without restrictions go all out &#8212; it could easily be real for a brasserie or brewery as it&#8217;s fully-fledged and perfectly crafted with a lot of work and time having clearly gone into it&#8230; just filling that fridge must have taken a minute. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/88974659\/Caserne-Brewing-Co\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Orrery by Dutchscot<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_orrery.jpg\" alt=\"Orrery by Dutchscot\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.orrery-restaurant.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Orrery<\/a> is a high-end French restaurant in London&#8217;s Marylebone Village and takes its name from the &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=orrery&#038;lr=&#038;safe=active&#038;source=lnms&#038;tbm=isch&#038;sa=X&#038;ved=2ahUKEwiD0uyW6aDmAhVLcq0KHdGNB_EQ_AUoAnoECBEQBA&#038;biw=1579&#038;bih=850\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mechanical model of the Solar System<\/a> that shows the relative positions and motions of the planets and moons&#8221;. The identity, designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dutch.scot\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dutchscot<\/a>, also revolves, at times almost literally, around the principle of the orrery with a slender slab serif where the letters rotate around the &#8220;O&#8221; in some applications. Elegant and pared down, the applications have some lovely production touches like the debossed circle on the menu, the gold foil stamping, and even the reflective copper finish on the exterior sign (not shown here). As a contrast, the menus feature illustrations and endpapers of custom marbling with a cosmic aesthetic that complement the name and add great bursts of texture and color to the minimalist design. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/87993439\/Orrery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Stoned Pizza Kitchen by Oscar Bastidas<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_stonedpizza.jpg\" alt=\"Stoned Pizza Kitchen by Oscar Bastidas\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/stoned_pizza_kitchen\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Stoned Pizza Kitchen<\/a> is a restaurant in Stone Mountain, GA, that serves not just the titular pizza but also burgers, sandwiches, wings, pastas, and other entr\u00e9es. The identity, designed by Brooklyn, NY-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mor8graphic.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Oscar Bastidas<\/a>, is unapologetically blunt (see what I did there?) about the restaurant&#8217;s name with a logo of a pizza slice that is clearly high and a range of illustrations that make it evident that they are alluding to pot more than the &#8220;stone&#8221; in Stone Mountain. The variety of lettering and illustration styles is broad but neatly brought together by the single-color rendering and they are all pretty much loads of fun. On their Instagram account I love all the pictures with the kids and the stoned-dude-eating-pizza illustration in the background on the wall &#8212; one day those kids are going to grow up and be like &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe mom and dad took us to that place with all the pot references&#8221;.
