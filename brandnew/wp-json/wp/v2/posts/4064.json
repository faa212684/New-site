The original Mini was developed in response to a fuel shortage in the wake of the Suez Canal crisis. In 1957, Alec Issigonis, the top engineer of the Morris Company, was challenged to design and build a small, fuel-efficient car capable of carrying four adults, and what he built was a perfect balance of fuel efficiency, functionality and fun. It&#8217;s from this heritage that the philosophy of MINImalism was inspired. MINImalism is a commitment to doing more with less, and these virtues were not lost on the endlessly inventive mind of racing pioneer John Cooper. He recognized the performance potential in the Mini&#8217;s uncompromised simplicity and turned it into a world-champion rally car.<br \/><br \/>The current MINI family builds on the tradition of the classic Mini, adding state-of-the-art technology and modern levels of safety, quality and reliability. And now there is a MINI model to suit just about everyone. Drivers can choose from the iconic MINI Cooper Hardtop, the open-air motoring experience of the MINI Convertible, the versatile MINI Clubman, or the surprisingly roomy four-door MINI Countryman, available with all-wheel drive. And all are famous for their creative use of space and nimble go-kart handling.&#8221;<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mini_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo for MINI by KKLD\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.
