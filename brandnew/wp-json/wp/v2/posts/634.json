(<a href=\"http:\/\/andybosselman.blogspot.com\/2008\/05\/first-data-identity.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">According to this blog post<\/a>, it&#8217;s feasible that Chicago-based VSA Partners did the work &mdash; given that <a href=\"http:\/\/www.vsapartners.com\/case_ovr.asp?clientid=52\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">First Data has been a client of them since 2001<\/a>, and the logo is indeed VSA-ish, I would jump on board and agree.) Fortunately, it&#8217;s great enough on its own that we can talk about it. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.firstdata.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">First Data<\/a> is one of those complex companies that make things behind the scenes work flawlessly through mind-bending systems, fancy computers and, surely, some type of mathematical equations. Or, in their words, &#8220;First Data processes transaction data of all kinds, harnesses the power of that data, and delivers innovations in secure infrastructure, intelligence and insight for its customers.&#8221; What it boils down to is technology, data, and getting it from one place to another &mdash; the new logo manages to convey all this and more. The interlocked &#8220;F&#8221; and &#8220;d&#8221; signal connectivity and interaction, while the hard-angled shapes convey that this is a technologically astute company that &mdash; instead of softening its image like the rest of the rounded identities (xerox, docomo, kodak) &mdash; isn&#8217;t afraid to communicate that it&#8217;s authoritative and hard-nosed. The old logo was a heartwarming play on visuals and language, but felt decidedly vintage. If there is one major complaint I have about the new logo is the annihilation of the dot over the &#8220;i.&#8221; Sure, it solves the boinking of it against the &#8220;F&#8221; but I just find this continued practice of de-dotting to be wrong. Nonetheless, In contrast to the remarkable new modern-day monogram introduced by First Data, it&#8217;s a small quibble. First Data could transfer my data any day of the week. <\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Thanks to Joe Szczepaniak and Rachid Molinary for the tip.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,26,88],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/634"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=634"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/634\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=634"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=634"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=634"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
