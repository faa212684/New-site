Over the weekend, without much festivities or press releasing, the Chicago-based channel formerly known as Superstation WGN relaunched as WGN America. I haven&#8217;t watched WGN since Michael Jordan retired, as they used to broadcast a bunch of the Bulls games, and until this morning I thought their logo was still <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Image:WGN_%281995%29_logo.svg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this simple little thing<\/a>, which was quite respectable, as opposed to the warped &#8220;S&#8221; they had until last week. Lee Abrams, chief innovation officer of WGN America&#8217;s parent company Tribune Broadcasting Company, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mediaweek.com\/mw\/content_display\/news\/local-broadcast\/e3ie45695d3d4f2d9aa1d1bc32de3d750e5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">stated the following craziness<\/a>: &#8220;[the new brand would] look and sound&hellip; like nothing else out there.&#8221; Lucky for us, indeed nothing much out there looks like this &mdash; except, as pointed out in the article, <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Image:Tmc1.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the Movie Channel&#8217;s oldoldold logo<\/a>, or the thousands of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bijinga.com\/nagel.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Patrick Nagel&#8217;s<\/a> illustrations. The logo was designed in-house as we learn from this scary sentence in the <em>MediaWeek<\/em> link above: &#8220;In an earlier memo, Abrams said that he had sent WGN&#8217;s creative director &#8216;a few Pink Floyd albums&#8217; after she had turned in some uninspired art\/voiceovers.&#8221; And there you have it&hellip; television branding for the twentyfirst century. Makes you wish they had just lowercased everything and made it roundy.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.coudal.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">coudal.com<\/a> for mentioning the change in their Fresh Signals yesterday.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,66,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/642"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=642"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/642\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=642"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=642"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=642"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
