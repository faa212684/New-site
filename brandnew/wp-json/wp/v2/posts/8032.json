We fuel hope both by celebrating the power of human connection to music, and by directing people towards the resources they need before it&#8217;s too late &#8211; because suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. Research shows that an overwhelming number of people who survive a suicide attempt are glad they lived, and do not die by another attempt. And over 90 percent of suicide victims have a diagnosable mental disorder. We believe that a connection to music, or to whatever treatment is best for a particular individual, can intervene and save lives. Sounds of Saving works with musicians willing to share how music has helped them through difficult times, and who will use their platform to promote opening up and seeking help during mental health challenges. These relatable stories about overcoming hopelessness or distress, especially from those we admire, have been proven to decrease suicide attempts and can normalize conversations about mental health.&#8221;<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sounds_of_saving_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Sounds of Saving by Red Peak\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sounds_of_saving_LogoAnimation.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo animation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sounds_of_saving_business_cards.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Sounds of Saving by Red Peak\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\" style=\"padding-bottom: 62.25%;\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sounds_of_saving_WebsiteAnimation.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sounds_of_saving_website.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Sounds of Saving by Red Peak\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sounds_of_saving_website_monile.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Sounds of Saving by Red Peak\" \/>\n<figcaption>Online presence.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sounds_of_saving_tshirt.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Sounds of Saving by Red Peak\" \/>\n<figcaption>T-shirt.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sounds_of_saving_stickers_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Sounds of Saving by Red Peak\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sounds_of_saving_stickers_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Sounds of Saving by Red Peak\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stickers.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/360578372?title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"360\" height=\"203\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Brand introduction and activation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"(Est. 2016) &quot;Over the past two decades in the U.S., suicide rates have risen by 33 percent.
