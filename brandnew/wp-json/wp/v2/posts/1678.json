It manages over 500,000 rooms across 4,200 hotels. Accor recently rebranded its line of economy hotels: Formerly ibis hotel, Etap Hotel, and All Seasons Hotels into ibis, ibis styles and ibis budget. The implementation of the new brand, designed by Boulogne-Billancourt, France-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wcie.fr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">W&amp;Cie<\/a>, and segmentation is expected to be completed worldwide by early 2013, with a strong communication campaign during 2012. The goal? to capitalize on the ibis &#8220;mega brand&#8221; through modernity, simplicity and well-being, while highlighting the unique qualities of each entity within the economy brands.<\/p><!--more--><p>Parent company Accor has committed &euro;150 million (US$204 million) to aid brand implementation as quickly as possible of the design developed by W&amp;Cie &mdash; obviously that&#8217;s not just for the logo: Yann Calli&eacute;re, president and COO of Accor, said the allocated funds will be used to accelerate renovations when needed and develop brand markers in the hotels, including a new bedding package. &#8220;We want to improve the level of comfort at the hotels,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That includes not only signage but an advertising campaign that will be launched, possibly around the summer or fall of 2012, when we have a significant number of hotel changes already.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ibis_buildings.jpg\" alt=\"Ibis\" \/><\/p>\n<p>So, on now to the actual design, the one with the not-so-comfy, perhaps made of plastic pillows that are the essence of the brand, an element picked up from the all seasons hotels. With upgraded puffiness and gradients, as well as lots of shadows, the typography has also been updated and thankfully some of the awkward elements of the previous type have been lost, where a somewhat inflated style with a few sharp elements compromised legibility. Especially at small sizes.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ibis_budget_logo.jpg\" alt=\"Ibis\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This time around, legibility is better but I can&#8217;t say that I find the typography all that interesting or innovating. While adequate I wish it was more exciting, something I was expecting when watching the brand video where different people interact with one essential element of a successful hotel stay: the pillow.<\/p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/30075838?portrait=0\" width=\"574\" height=\"323\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen allowFullScreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>W&amp;Cie seems to have embraced a more unique typographic approach in the actual applications of the brand, and I gravitate more towards these elements which give the brand a lot more personality and character. The main challenge of this redesign is for the pillows at all ibis hotels to be memorable enough to make them worth being their logo.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ibis_hotel_lg.jpg\" onclick=\"window.open('https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ibis_hotel_lg.jpg','popup','width=1024,height=768,scrollbars=no,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ibis_hotel.jpg\" alt=\"Ibis\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ibis_budget_lg.jpg\" onclick=\"window.open('https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ibis_budget_lg.jpg','popup','width=1024,height=768,scrollbars=no,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ibis_budget.jpg\" alt=\"Ibis\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ibis_styles_lg.jpg\" onclick=\"window.open('https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ibis_styles_lg.jpg','popup','width=1024,height=768,scrollbars=no,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ibis_styles.jpg\" alt=\"Ibis\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Click on images for bigger view.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_111014_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_111014_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_111014_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_111014_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":13,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,73,26],"tags":[491,617,46,632,633,634,42,635],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1678"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/13"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1678"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1678\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1678"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1678"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1678"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
