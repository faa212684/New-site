The packaging revolves around a rabbit being hit by a lightning bolt not only because it looks awesome but because it&#8217;s a visualization of Chinese folklore story &#8220;The Gold Rabbit&#8221; or &#8220;Moon Rabbit&#8221; where said rabbit is constantly working on the elixir of life. If you love beer (as do I) the &#8220;elixir of life&#8221; is by no means an exaggeration. But back to the packaging: I love the x-ray&#8217;d rabbit, it&#8217;s such a cool drawing and so completely unexpected not just for a beer but for anything. The typography is great, with a bold mix of styles that Helms Workshop can pull off like few others and the color palette is happy and hoppy. <a href=\"http:\/\/helmsworkshop.com\/work\/bionic-brew-brand-identity-packaging\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a> <\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Shop-around by Design by Toko<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_shoparound.jpg\" alt=\"Shop-around by Design by Toko\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.shop-around.nl\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Shop-around<\/a> is a rep agency and production house (coordinating teams on projects) for freelancers in illustration, graphic design, animation, motion graphics and interactive design, so ad agencies, clients, and other creative service buyers can shop around in Shop-around&#8217;s roster. But how do you put a price on creativity? Well, by literally putting a price on it as Sydney-based <a href=\"http:\/\/designbytoko.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Design by Toko<\/a> did. Using the vernacular language of something like the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=motex+price+gun&#038;source=lnms&#038;tbm=isch&#038;sa=X&#038;ved=0ahUKEwjgwv2IuYXSAhWh5YMKHU1sCogQ_AUICSgC&#038;biw=1387&#038;bih=908\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Motex price gun<\/a> used by small stores around the world for whom barcodes are not analog enough, the identity has a great lo-fi vibe with clunky typography and odd shapes. The idea of turning the business cards into peel-able stickers is great fun and the oversized price stickers look awesome on the materials. <a href=\"http:\/\/designbytoko.com\/projects\/shop-around\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">AND UNION Beer Cans<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_andunion.jpg\" alt=\"AND UNION Beer Cans\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.andunion.com\/en\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AND UNION<\/a> is a kind of mix of the two clients above&#8230; it&#8217;s sort of a rep agency for a current roster of four microbreweries who they work with to bring to market a range of craft beers, all in a modernist approach, which can be appreciated in their new range of cans for three of their products. The cans are a single color each, with the absolute bare minimum of typography &#8212; that looks almost as if they did rubdowns by hand on each can &#8212; and the kicker is an embossed can that has a brick-like texture unlike any other beer can in the market. It&#8217;s almost disconcerting how minimal these are, like there is something wrong with them, but they are such Pinterest- and Instagram-bait (in a good way) it&#8217;s unfair to the rest of the beer cans out there. (Lastly, I think these were designed by them not a designer, but I&#8217;m not 100% certain). <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thedieline.com\/blog\/2017\/1\/26\/a-fresh-look-at-craft-beer-cans\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Beer, creatives, and beer&#8230; a good way to end the week, with work from Austin, Sydney, and Munich (I think).
