(I&#8217;m not in the business software and solution software, but isn&#8217;t 2,400 people too many? I digress.) To celebrate its 25th anniversary, Exact introduced a new logo designed by Brussels based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.duvalguillaume.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Duval Guillaume<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>Exact also launches a new logo consisting of the Exact word mark preceded by an &#8216;equal&#8217; sign, expressing the belief that Exact co-exists with its customers and the value that&#8217;s being created through this collaboration. The tagline &#8216;Exact. And it all comes together.&#8217; reflects the spirit of what Exact brings to its customers: the added value that comes with its integrated solutions and cornerstones proposition. It also expresses a feeling of comfort and ease, and that in the end, things will be fine.<br \/><br \/>Clemens Riedl, Exact&#8217;s Marketing Director, says: &#8220;With the new visual identity we are getting much closer to the entrepreneurial world we serve and are now able to communicate globally in a consistent way.&#8221;<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.exact.com\/global\/en\/about-exact\/news\/nr20091116a.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press Release<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/exact_brochures.jpg\" alt=\"Exact\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Brochure cover samples.<\/p>\n<p>It may be a strange way to describe this, but I was quite charmed by the new logo and how unapologetic it is about being Old School Tech. What&#8217;s funny is that the old logo, set in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.linotype.com\/730\/dickjensen.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Serpentine<\/a> (which was designed in 1972), looked like it was trying to appear as hardcore, 1980s tech. The new logo feels like it&#8217;s trying to appear as hardcore, <em>1990s<\/em> tech, lagging almost a decade behind in the aesthetics of today&#8217;s logos. And, lo and behold, it&#8217;s actually refreshing. The typography isn&#8217;t quite sophisticated but its pairing with the equal sign turns it into a very smart, and sophisticated, concept. The weights of all the elements are nicely balanced too, and all the corners are well rounded for safety and friendliness. But perhaps my favorite feature of the new identity is the small range of icons (below) that are as chunky as the logo and help the whole identity feel just slightly more contemporary.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/exact_icons.gif\" alt=\"Exact\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Icon set.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to Tako Bruinsma for the tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_20091123_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_20091123_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_20091123_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_20091123_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,25,88],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/975"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=975"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/975\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=975"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=975"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=975"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
