But not complicated things like <em>Deal or No Deal<\/em>, I like simple things like <em>Wheel of Fortune<\/em>, <em>The Price is Right<\/em>, <em>Family Feud<\/em> and even that crazy <em>10,000 Pyramid<\/em> show. I vividly remember when a channel, devoted solely to game shows, debuted in 1994. I couldn&#8217;t believe it. And I watched it. Couldn&#8217;t believe that either. But here we are, fourteen years later, and the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gsn.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Game Show Network<\/a> is still on, even after different guises (abbreviated to GSN) and efforts to expand its programming with reality shows, it&#8217;s all back to basics with good, old fashioned fun.<\/p><!--more--><p><a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Game_Show_Network#Logos\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The original logo was somewhat off target, the second one was trippy-goofy and the third one had gone way corporate and lame<\/a>, so it&#8217;s nice to see this last iteration strike a good balance of its previous two incarnations. Despite that funky visual illusion where you see black circles between the corners of the squares the logo is simple, colorful and, more important, relevant to the content of the channel. It also animates nicely on the web site as a sliding puzzle. Nothing groundbreaking in this identity, but a nice update where one was desperately needed.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Thanks to Jake Hamilton for the tip.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,66,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/737"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=737"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/737\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=737"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=737"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=737"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
