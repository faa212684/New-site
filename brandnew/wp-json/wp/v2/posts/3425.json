It manages eleven different lotteries with annual sales of over $4 billion and five sport and race betting providers with sales of $3.6 billion. It also operates three businesses that provide monitoring and support services to gaming venues. With a wide range of consumer brands under it, Tatts Group decided it was time to improve its own presence as the parent company and introduced a new identity designed by Sydney-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hulsbosch.com.au\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hulsbosch<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>Research conducted by Hulsbosch, revealed that a new level of disruption in the brand&#8217;s narrative was required to increase the awareness levels. In particular the need to elevate the Tatts Group corporate brand to a position that could communicate to the market they are a trusted provider of entertainment products and services.<\/blockquote><h3>Provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tatts_group_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Tatts Group by Hulsbosch\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The simple, clean, contemporary logo style is composed of two components: the top graphic known as &#8216;the star&#8217; and the distinctive lettering &#8216;Tatts Group&#8217;. In addition the colour palette brings scale and boldness to the brand identity.<\/blockquote><h3>Provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/hHj2krh9WMA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>New identity introduction. Some extra applications shown throughout and logo animation at the end.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo was kind of funny, with the misfortunately shaped stars on the ball looking really sad and droopy &mdash; makes you pine for the stars of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/new_logo_for_imperial_oil.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">yesterday&#8217;s Imperial logo<\/a>. The new logo provides an alternate interpretation of stars by hiding one inside five strange, pin-like graphic devices. Even though I really have no idea what those five overlapping things are, there is something nice about the icon&hellip; the spacing, the colors, the tension created by the sharp points. I wouldn&#8217;t marry it but I would take it on one date. The wordmark looks like all other Hulsbosch wordmarks &mdash; Gotham-ish, Effra-ish, etc.-ish &mdash; and is a perfectly acceptable parent company choice. The &#8220;tt&#8221; ligature is nicely treated.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tatts_group_guidelines.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Tatts Group by Hulsbosch\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sample guideline pages.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tatts_group_cap.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Tatts Group by Hulsbosch\" \/>\n<figcaption>Cap.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tatts_group_business_card.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Tatts Group by Hulsbosch\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business Card.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tatts_group_web.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Tatts Group by Hulsbosch\" \/>\n<figcaption>Online presence.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">In application there is lots of pretty blues, plenty of white space, and basic repetition of the logo throughout. Nothing groundbreaking but, again, just what a parent company needs. Overall, a clear improvement.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"With roots as far as back as the 1880s through managing the sales of Tattersall&#8217;s &mdash; the leading auctioneer of race horses in Ireland and the UK &mdash; in Sydney and Tasmania, Tatts Group is a leading company in the&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,36,26],"tags":[294,562,994,586],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3425"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3425"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3425\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3425"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3425"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3425"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
