Over the years they have completed 245 projects that impact over 82,000 people. This November, the organization introduced a new identity designed pro-bono by New York, NY-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.prophet.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Prophet<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>The visual identity for The Water Trust is a clean, strong word mark featuring a blue droplet symbol at the center, evoking the central role that water plays in the organization&#8217;s mission. The droplet symbol is shared across two words, &#8220;water&#8221; and &#8220;trust&#8221; &mdash; much like water is a shared resource &mdash; and reinforcing the collaborative nature of the organization. The visual system will support the organization as it explores new technologies and geographies in the future.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20141208005766\/en\/Prophet-Refreshes-Brand-Visual-Identity-Water-Trust#.VI7Di2TF_NU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Prophet press release<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_water_trust_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo for The Water Trust by Prophet\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_water_trust_logo_color_variations.png\" alt=\"New Logo for The Water Trust by Prophet\" \/>\n<figcaption>Color variations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>We&#8217;ve had a string of really bad &#8220;before&#8221; logos this month on Brand New that I&#8217;m almost starting to feel bad for finding faults in them. All I will say about this is that, like the logo, I shed a tear. Or squeeze a droplet of water out of my nostril. The good thing is that the logo is not the one doing the 245 projects and clearly the organization has fared pretty well with what it has, but a fresh and smart logo can do wonders for a non-profit, particularly when it comes to approaching donors and media. This new logo is a clever and memorable interpretation of the organization&#8217;s purpose, showing a single drop of water in the name that doubles as the &#8220;A&#8221; and &#8220;U&#8221;. In terms of letterforms, the &#8220;A&#8221; works wonderfully but the &#8220;U&#8221; is a little wonky. Nonetheless, as a bigger idea this is really great and the improved impact it will have for the organization will undoubtedly be positive.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_water_trust_business_cards.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for The Water Trust by Prophet\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_water_trust_pins.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for The Water Trust by Prophet\" \/>\n<figcaption>Pins.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_water_trust_wall.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for The Water Trust by Prophet\" \/>\n<figcaption>Wall.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_water_trust_mud_car.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for The Water Trust by Prophet\" \/>\n<figcaption>Mud.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">In application it&#8217;s mostly prototype and renderings of the logo in different scenarios so there isn&#8217;t much to see or judge. One thing is for sure, you could not extrude the previous logo out of stone, so definitely a win.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 2008, The Water Trust is an international non-profit and independent non-governmental organization that works with &quot;rural communities in East Africa to create effective water, sanitation and hygiene systems to combat disease, decrease poverty and enable people to live&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,79,26],"tags":[602,863,112],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3666"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3666"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3666\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3666"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3666"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3666"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
