The hottest item, of course, are phones &#8212; including iPhones, officially approved by Apple to be resold with them &#8212; but also include laptops, cameras, drones, TVs, and other small appliances all sourced from the world&#8217;s best refurbishers and by partnering with manufacturers. First available in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Belgium, the online shop entered the U.S. market in 2018 where &#8220;sales are growing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/parmyolson\/2018\/08\/22\/back-market-refurbished-iphones-apple-samsung\/#5d4ed73447cf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ten times faster among Americans<\/a> after six months of business than they did at the same juncture in Europe&#8221; and now has over 150 employees across offices in Paris and Bordeaux, France, and in New York, NY. Recently, Back Market introduced a new identity designed by <a href=\"https:\/\/koto.studio\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Koto<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>The identity lives and breathes rebellion, embracing the so-called flaws in the product and positions using Back Market as a tiny protest against the system. A diverse set of stickers carry slogans and sayings, bringing endless variation to applications whilst giving customers and merchants a chance to participate in the identity. These stickers, matched with the bold tone of voice, help to support Back Market&#8217;s image as a liberator, freeing the world from tech obsolescence.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/koto.studio\/project\/backmarket\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Koto project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/back_market_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Back Market by Koto\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo had a decent idea with a loop conveying a sense of something of being repurposed or redirected at a point where it might have gone off course or, in this case, the trash. The execution could have been a lot better as a way to engender more trust with consumers. I would have totally had second thoughts of buying from them with that old logo. The new logo comes as no surprise in a sans serif uniform but there are a couple of quirks that make it a little more interesting than usual. The double chevron around the &#8220;k&#8221; is a nice subtle metaphor for &#8220;rewind&#8221;, as in giving these products a second fresh start. The execution is quite well done and doesn&#8217;t hinder the readability of the name. The straighter &#8220;r&#8221; and angled notches on the &#8220;a&#8221;s give this some added personality. I also like how this logo feels a little more &#8220;clandestine&#8221; in its all-black configuration as an ode to the name, which sounds like &#8220;Black Market&#8221; (which was probably on purpose when it was picked). The more prominent identity element, though, are a set of stickers&#8230;<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/back_market_logo_with_stickers.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Back Market by Koto\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo with stickers.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/back_market_stickers_animated.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Stickers.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The stickers are fun and nicely done. Although they are a bit random &#8212; a rabbit, an &#8220;OK&#8221; hand sign, a globe with legs, a&#8230; ghost? &#8212; the design aesthetic is consistent and both the single-color approach and the bold serif further help unify them. <\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/back_market_mission.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Mission.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/back_market_brand_idea.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Back Market by Koto\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brand idea.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/back_market_typography.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Back Market by Koto\" \/>\n<figcaption>Typography.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/back_market_website.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Back Market by Koto\" \/>\n<figcaption>Website.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/back_market_social.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Back Market by Koto\" \/>\n<figcaption>Social media.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/back_market_app.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Back Market by Koto\" \/>\n<figcaption>Mobile app.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>We wanted to reflect the natural humour, up-beat attitude and passion of the team in the identity, but at the same time are careful to display the products in a way that show off their true quality and value &#8211; professionally refurbished to an &#8216;as-good-as-new&#8217; standard. Eclectic art direction and refreshingly honest copy capture the true nature of how we use technology. Ultimately Back Market prove that whilst e-waste and obsolescence are subjects that should be taken seriously, there&#8217;s no reason we can&#8217;t have fun while doing it.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/koto.studio\/project\/backmarket\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Koto project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/back_market_wildpostings.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Back Market by Koto\" \/>\n<figcaption>Wild postings.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/back_market_ad.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Back Market by Koto\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/back_market_ad_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Back Market by Koto\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/back_market_ad_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Back Market by Koto\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/back_market_ad_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Back Market by Koto\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/back_market_ad_04.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Back Market by Koto\" \/>\n<figcaption>Various ads.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The applications have a broad range of variations, which is both good and bad. The former in that it provides a wide range of expressions unified by the typography and stickers. The latter in that some things feel like they belong to different companies &#8212; for example, the sweaty dude ad is more VICE-like whereas the big billboard above it is more, say, Samsung-like. Also, I&#8217;m still undecided whether the combination of such disparate elements is working or not: you have stickers that have one aesthetic, a serif that has a different feel, and photography with yet another vibe. I kind of like the irreverence of putting them together without being self-conscious about it but it&#8217;s also&#8230; odd.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/back_market_boxes.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Back Market by Koto\" \/>\n<figcaption>Boxes.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/back_market_tote_tshirt.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Back Market by Koto\" \/>\n<figcaption>Tote and t-shirt.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/back_market_zipper.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Back Market by Koto\" \/>\n<figcaption>Pouch.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">Overall, what I really like about this is that it gives Back Market a narrative beyond &#8220;we sell cheap, not-new tech&#8221; and instead builds an aura of &#8220;stick-it-to-the-man&#8221; by making the act of buying cheap, not-new tech fun, engaging, and replacing any stigma of buying used with empowerment and excitement.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 2014, Back Market is a marketplace &#8212; reportedly the first and largest &#8212; focused on bringing thousands of refurbished electronic devices and appliances from certified professionals to consumers.
