Earlier this month, after a short closure period, the museum reopened at the new location with a new identity designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/turnstyle.studio\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Turnstyle<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>A new &#8216;N&#8217; monogram references the museum&#8217;s name, but also acts as a subtle nod to one of the key architectural features of the new building. &#8220;The fjord metaphor is hard to miss when you visit the museum itself,&#8221; explains Graham. &#8220;From the moment you walk in the doors, the cavernous fjord-inspired walls dominate your view. The bridges that criss-cross this gap are metaphors for connections &#8211; between Nordic countries, between the Nordic region and Seattle, between old and new &#8211; and they are literally connections between galleries that focus on these varying topics.&#8221;<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.creativereview.co.uk\/seattles-nordic-museum-rebrands-to-reflect-contemporary-culture\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Creative Review story<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nordic_museum_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Nordic Museum by Turnstyle\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\" ><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nordic_museum_logo_colors.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Color variations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo had one job to do &#8212; spell out the name in correct order, &#8220;Nordic Heritage Museum&#8221; &#8212; and yet it failed by placing &#8220;Heritage&#8221; in the one spot where it made the least sense as the logo could only be read as &#8220;Nordic Museum Heritage&#8221; or &#8220;Heritage Nordic Museum&#8221; but never &#8220;Nordic Heritage Museum&#8221;. Also, it was typeset in Helvetica. The new logo is supposed to reference <a href=\"https:\/\/nordicmuseum.org\/future\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the metaphorical fjord that is built into the new space<\/a> by forming a narrowing inlet into the rectangle shape that then forms an &#8220;N&#8221;. It&#8217;s minimalist, that&#8217;s for sure. As an &#8220;N&#8221;, even an abstract one, it&#8217;s not entirely convincing and as a visual fjord, it&#8217;s not an immediate read either. It&#8217;s not a bad monogram or icon and it looks the part of a museum logo but it feels almost unfinished.<\/p>\n<p>The Avant Garde-esque monogram is fine but and I like how the &#8220;N&#8221; matches the monogram but other than that it&#8217;s fairly forgettable. The one thing that does bother me about the wordmark is that the same sans serif was not used throughout the identity which, instead, uses Lineto&#8217;s Circular and misses the opportunity to establish a consistent type language from logo to everything else.  I&#8217;m not saying all identities have to use the same font everywhere as they do in the logo but when they are this close in appearance, yes, they should.<\/p>\n<p>The all-the-colors approach is getting a little numbing.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nordic_museum_business_cards_a.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Nordic Museum by Turnstyle\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nordic_museum_visitors_guide.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Nordic Museum by Turnstyle\" \/>\n<figcaption>Visitors guide.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nordic_museum_brochuree.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Nordic Museum by Turnstyle\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brochure.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nordic_museum_inserts.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Nordic Museum by Turnstyle\" \/>\n<figcaption>Inserts.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The applications are okay.
