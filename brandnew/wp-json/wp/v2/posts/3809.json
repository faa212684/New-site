The primary reason is that I really liked this project when it came out and I&#8217;ve just been provided with some previously unpublished images that make me like this even more. Another reason is to highlight the typographic work done by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.monotype.com\/studio\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Monotype Studio<\/a> in developing a proprietary typeface, Southwest Sans, designed by Monotype&#8217;s Type Director, Dan Rhatigan. The final reason, which is what precipitated the renewed interest is the launch of an interesting collection published jointly by Lippincott and Monotype called <em><a href=\"http:\/\/shawmutweb.com\/microsites\/MonotypeLippincott\/app\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brands with Heart<\/a><\/em>, featuring a &#8220;palette of typefaces selected for their distinct personalities and idiosyncratic tendencies as well as their ability to convey the humanistic elements of a brand&#8217;s personality.&#8221; So, here we go.<\/p>\n<!--more--><p>(And, no, for the pessimists and haters out there, this is not a paid post by Lippincott or Monotype.

They show their distinction and unique character. When matched well with the voice of the brand the typeface and tone of voice truly become one. So it&#8217;s not just about selecting a typeface that has human qualities, but about having a distinctive voice to go with it. And when your voice is authentic, it is more likely to resonate with customers and employees.&#8221;<\/blockquote><h3>Lippincott, Senior Partner, Rodney Abbot<\/h3>\n<p>Also at the time of release, we didn&#8217;t know Monotype Studio had been involved in the design of a proprietary sans serif.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/southwest_followup_08_Southwest_TypographyCollage.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: Southwest Airlines\" \/>\n<figcaption>Typography collage.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>&#8220;The mix of qualities in a contemporary humanist typeface &mdash; warm and mechanical but not too informal, clean and functional but not too austere &mdash; strike a balance that reflects the quality of a brand like Southwest. The typefaces need to have a personality that encourages the friendly spirit and interaction that is essential to Southwest, but also have a neat functionality that shows that the company is responsible and accountable.&#8221;<\/blockquote><h3>Monotype, Type Director, Dan Rhatigan<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/southwest_followup_09_working_sketches.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: Southwest Airlines\" \/>\n<figcaption>Process.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/southwest_followup_13_Southwest-Sans-Details-3.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: Southwest Airlines\" \/>\n<figcaption>Details.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Since I was already a fan of this project, all of these images cement it for me.
