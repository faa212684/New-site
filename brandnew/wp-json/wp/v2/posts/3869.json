The festival&#8217;s identity is an explosion of bright fluorescent colors and not much more than the thunderous logo with some brief accompanying condensed sans serif type. What makes the application work really well too are the off-the-shelf materials (shown at the link) like the hats and lanyards that also come in fluorescent hues. The clich&eacute; that Latin America is colorful is very well represented here. (In a good way). <a href=\"http:\/\/iscreativestudio.com\/project\/latin-american-design-festival-2015\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project here<\/strong><\/a><\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Cacao Cultura by Vladimir Shlygin<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_cacaocultura.jpg\" alt=\"Cacao Cultura by Vladimir Shlygin\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/cacaocultura.ru\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cacao Cultura<\/a> (Cocoa Culture) is an online resource and shop by Russian confectionery and chocolate distributor Agentstvo Kvorum. The identity, designed by Moscow-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/vladimirshlygin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Vladimir Shlygin<\/a>, relies on a small range of chocolate-chip-sized icons that dance around the wordmark along a pre-established grid (see animated GIF at the link) giving the placement of the icons some kind of structure. The customized sans serif is a little odd but I&#8217;m digging the curved crossbar of the &#8220;A&#8221;s and unexpected &#8220;R&#8221;. The spare layouts are quite nice and make the chocolate icons pop in their red, mint, and brown colors. <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/23581573\/Cacao-Cultura\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Get Set Festival by Epiforma<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_getset.jpg\" alt=\"Get Set Festival by Epiforma\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">Celebrated in Porto, Portugal, since 2010, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.getsetfestival.net\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Get Set Festival<\/a> is an art event that brings workshops, urban instalations, performances, exhibitions, conferences, parties, concerts, and more to the city. The festival&#8217;s latest identity, by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/epiforma.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Epiforma<\/a> goes the full Gestalt with a geometric GET SET wordmark that drops bits and pieces as it sees fit, sometimes being more readable and sometimes plain indiscernible. The best piece of the project is the poster with the cascade-like effect, made only more attractive by the primary color palette. Bonus for creative project photography. <a href=\"http:\/\/epiforma.com\/getsetfestival\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"We get very festive this Friday with colorful work from Lima, Moscow, and Porto&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[882,617,906],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3869"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3869"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3869\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3869"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3869"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3869"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
