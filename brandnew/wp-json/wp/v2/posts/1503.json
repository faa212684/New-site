What that means is that they develop new products that are hard to categorize in one fell swoop: they manufacture floor coverings, carpet, specialty fabrics, and even chemicals that go into things like crayons. Milliken holds an astounding 2,200 patents and employes 7,000 people &mdash; more than a 100 PhD&#8217;s among them &mdash; and maintains 39 manufacturing facilities across the world. In April Milliken introduced a new identity designed by San Francisco-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.saltbranding.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SALT Branding<\/a> that is based on the signature of its late President Roger Milliken, who had taken over the company in 1947 when his father and company founder Seth Milliken passed away.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/milliken_signature.gif\" alt=\"Miliken\" \/><\/p>\n<blockquote>Roger Milliken was famous internally for his hand-written notes that are often kept by employees for years. The new logo expresses that personal connection that is so important to the company, and the design system even includes a customized script typeface, titled &#8220;Thank-you&#8221;, that keeps that idea alive. The logo design also reinforces the playful approach the company applies to its problem solving, and is a simple and bold statement that adds a personal touch and accessibility to the business.<br \/>&mdash; SALT Press Materials<\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/milliken_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"Miliken\" \/><\/p>\n<blockquote>To support its commitment to delivering world-class innovation, the company also unveiled a new logo for the first time in 40 years. Reflecting the vibrancy and creativity of the organization and based upon the signature of the company&#8217;s 70-year leader and former chairman, the late Mr. Roger Milliken, the new logo is simple, playful, bold, and signals a continuing commitment to excellence, leadership, and ethics.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.milliken.com\/hr\/emlknhtm.nsf\/file\/files\/$File\/press-release.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press Release [PDF]<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/miliken_01_MIL_lobby_sign_web.png\" alt=\"Miliken\" width=\"574\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/miliken_02_BusinessCard_2up_MIL_r1_k_web.png\" alt=\"Miliken\" width=\"574\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/miliken_03_Brochure1_MIL_corp_k_web.png\" alt=\"Miliken\" width=\"574\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/miliken_04_MK_Box_Art_r1_k_web.png\" alt=\"Miliken\" width=\"574\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/miliken_05_MIL_FC_binder_sample_SA_k_web.png\" alt=\"Miliken\" width=\"574\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/miliken_06_Brochure1_MIL_etage_r1_k_web.png\" alt=\"Miliken\" width=\"574\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/miliken_07_Magazine_Ad3_Inspired_k_web.png\" alt=\"Miliken\" width=\"574\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/miliken_08_MIL_showroom_crop_web.png\" alt=\"Miliken\" width=\"574\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/miliken_09_MIL_livery_blue_web.png\" alt=\"Miliken\" width=\"574\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Unlike many of the recent redesigns on Brand New, the previous logo wasn&#8217;t bad at all. The icon clearly signaled &#8220;fabrics&#8221; of some kind &mdash; perhaps it said fabrics too much, becoming limiting for a company doing so many other things &mdash; and it was well executed and interesting. Perhaps it presented some reproduction problems when made small and the typography was bland but there wasn&#8217;t much wrong with it. The change to the new identity is very abrupt and it gives the company a very drastic change of personality, going from a very serious, corporate look to a consumer-friendly one and in the fields of fabric-producing and chemical-mixing I&#8217;m not sure how well a &#8220;soft&#8221; look plays. I certainly have to say that not knowing what Milliken was before doing this post, if I were shown the logo I would think it would be for a brand of Swiss chocolates. Nonetheless, the script wordmark is very nicely done and it&#8217;s a great gesture to the company&#8217;s roots that it is based on Milliken&#8217;s own signature, it makes for a great story to tell at trade shows and when executives and sales people meet other executives and customers.<\/p>\n<p>In the applications the logo beefs up a little with a more serious and controlled approach and the good, ol&#8217; fashioned corporate blue does a good job at helping in that regard. Overall, this is a very interesting transformation.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/milliken_animation.png\" alt=\"Miliken\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">A brief, but nice, logo animation can be found <a href=\"http:\/\/www.saltbranding.com\/milliken.mov\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a>.
