So whenever I see it well used in a non-ironic way, it gives me great joy. For <a href=\"http:\/\/ahhweekend.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Weekend<\/a>, a coffee shop inside the Joule Hotel in Dallas, TX, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.roandcostudio.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">RoAndCo<\/a> in New York, typeset the name as tight and friendly as they could, tilted the &#8220;e&#8221;s and shipped it in a wonderfully vibrant brick red, single-color palette. Speaking of weekend, tomorrow can not come soon enough. <a href=\"http:\/\/roandcostudio.com\/projects\/weekend-branding\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Red Bear Survival Camp by Bunpei Ginza<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_redbear.jpg\" alt=\"Red Bear Survival Camp by Bunpei Ginza\"\/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">There isn&#8217;t a lot of information or more images on this project but, really, what else do you need to know? (Okay, maybe a little). Red Bear Survival Camp was a shelter experience program for kids to learn skills to help in the event of a disaster, held at the Kobe Municipal Arboretum in 2011. Gotta love the name and how it pays off in the logo designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bunpei.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bunpei Ginza<\/a>: a red bear in the shape of a tent with a wood fire for a mouth and awesome claws. The typography in both languages is pretty cool too. <a href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/19n3UVa\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">The Lodhi by 211 Studio and Mukund VR<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_lodhi.jpg\" alt=\"The Lodhi by 211 Studio and Mukund VR\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">Located in New Delhi, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thelodhi.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Lodhi<\/a> is a luxury hotel with a rich display of patterns and textures in its architecture and interior design so it&#8217;s only fitting that its logo reflects that &mdash; sometimes literally, with the logo regularly being reproduced in shiny gold. Designed in collaboration by local designers <a href=\"http:\/\/twooneonestudio.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">211 Studio<\/a> and  <a href=\"http:\/\/www.behance.net\/mukundvr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mukund VR<\/a> the logo is &#8220;inspired by the 15th century Lodhi dynasty&#8221; which I&#8217;m not sure how so but all I know is that I like what I see, specially the rich pattern inside the wobbly circle shape, providing a nice contrast between a kind of mathematical precision in the patterns and an organic container. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/The-Lodhi\/7868345\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"It has been a while since I last did some Friday Likes.
