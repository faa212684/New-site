[&hellip;] Koto designers James Greenfield and Jowey Roden, who were also behind Airbnb&#8217;s brand redesign, took inspiration from the rainbow eucalyptus tree. Greenfield, Co-founder of Koto, says: &#8220;We wanted to create a tree that Gumtree could own, something that felt timeless yet digital and worked on a range of scales from a small mobile screen to building-sized posters. We did a lot of research around images of trees and how they had been represented by artists and designers through the ages to really understand how our audience of millions see trees as an icon. The final logo has been informed by this extensive research along with our own rigorous design process.&#8221;<\/blockquote><h3>Koto provided press release<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/mEdJ5JHEoDs\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Introduction to logo with some preamble by the client.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/gumtree_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Gumtree by Koto\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo looked like it represented the estate of a Nigerian prince looking to transfer assets to a U.S. bank account. It was a pretty terrible logo and &mdash; as is the case with Craigslist in the U.S. &mdash; it&#8217;s surprising that so many people don&#8217;t pay attention to the design and use it en masse. Nothing beats a good deal I guess. The new logo maintains the drawing of an Eucalyptus tree but is now rendered as a more abstract icon. It&#8217;s a very top-heavy drawing, looking more like a 3-leaf clover than a tree and the three protrusions of the tree seem to lack definition. I mean, it&#8217;s a hundred times better than the original, it has the potential to become really well known simply by number of impressions, and I&#8217;m all for reduction and simple marks but this might be a little too minimal for its own good. The wordmark is standard-issue sans serif, so not much to comment on there.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/gumtree_guidelines.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Gumtree by Koto\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sample guideline pages.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/gumtree_colors.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Gumtree by Koto\" \/>\n<figcaption>Color palette, inspired by the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=Rainbow+Eucalyptus&#038;lr=lang_en&#038;tbs=lr:lang_1en&#038;source=lnms&#038;tbm=isch&#038;sa=X&#038;ved=0ahUKEwjGjMmYk6TKAhUGVyYKHRmMBtIQ_AUIBygB&#038;biw=1600&#038;bih=866\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rainbow Eucalyptus<\/a>.

Even the ads with the soft-focus photography and forced copywriting feel like they are trying to sell you a very idealistic lifestyle that doesn&#8217;t really come from second-hand items on a classifieds website. In application, when the icon is used as an asterisk or marker on the ads it doesn&#8217;t have the presence required to make a strong impact and leaves the wordmark all by itself, which has no personality to stand on its own. Maybe I&#8217;m being overly harsh on this project and I should accept that it&#8217;s an unequivocally positive evolution but there is something about it that feels too strongly manufactured to be cool when it really isn&#8217;t.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 2000, Gumtree is the leading classifieds website in the UK with 15.3 million unique visitors a month and the claim that it&#8217;s used by 1 in 3 adults every month.
