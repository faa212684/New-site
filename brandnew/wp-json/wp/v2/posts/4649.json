As the name of this cluster implies, it represents the fashion and textile industry that consists of 1,219 companies operating in the textile, footwear, leather goods, and jewelry industry which, according to the cluster, is &#8220;one of the four largest industrial sectors contributions to GDP in the region&#8221;. Modacc&#8217;s new name and identity has been designed by Barcelona-based <a href=\"http:\/\/toormix.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Toormix<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>Modacc (fashion + the initials of the Catalan Cluster) was the solution to upgrade the sector as the first point and the cluster format as a complement. The new graphic identity keeps the same blue color as a corporative element and maximizes some new values such as creativity, innovation and its presence through a distinctive graphic, which is variable and linked to the weave, a ready-make base onto the fashion world. Therefore, a few fresh graphics with different patterns make shape the new cluster.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/toormix.com\/ca\/project\/modacc-identitat-i-naming\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Toormix project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/modacc_logo_detail.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Modacc by Toormix\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo, well, all you have to do is look at it to realize that it wasn&#8217;t good or, more important, representative of the fashion industry. If there was an award for Group of Letters Least Likely to Succeed as a Ligature, the old logo would win unanimously. The new logo is a simple geometric sans wordmark infused with fabric swatch patterns. It reminds me of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/new_logo_and_identity_for_teamweek_by_fraktal.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Teamweek project<\/a> we covered a few months ago but this one having more conceptual relevance and a clearer connection between the textures and the subject they represent. The logo feels like it could have been pushed a little more so that the swatches make up the letterforms like the &#8220;M&#8221; and the &#8220;d&#8221; as opposed to the &#8220;o&#8221; and &#8220;a&#8221;, where the swatch is clearly masked inside.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/modacc_textures.png\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Modacc by Toormix\" \/>\n<figcaption>Patterns.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/modacc_stationery.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Modacc by Toormix\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stationery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/modacc_business_cards_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Modacc by Toormix\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/modacc_business_cards_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Modacc by Toormix\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/modacc_brochure.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Modacc by Toormix\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/modacc_brochure_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Modacc by Toormix\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/modacc_brochure_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Modacc by Toormix\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brochure.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">In application, I like how the swatches are used as patches instead of repeating patterns and they almost look as if you had a number of swatches laying on the table trying to pick one for that killer jacket. The exception to this approach is in the back of the business cards where they do become patterns and the diagonal stripes one alone is probably the subconscious reason why I gravitated towards liking this project. Overall, it&#8217;s not necessarily the most surprising concept and\/or visual representation but the execution is quite good and the applications come together nicely if perhaps a little too heavy handed on the indigo blue color.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 2011 as Cl\u00faster Textil Moda de Catalunya (Textile Fashion Cluster of Catalunya), the newly renamed Modacc (Moda Cl\u00faster Catalunya) is one of 30 Catalunya clusters that represent different business that influence the Catalan industry.
