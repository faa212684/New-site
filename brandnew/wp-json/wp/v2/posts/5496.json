With a larger mission to bring accessible, healthier and more sustainable food to the market, Just&#8217;s product line main attraction is that it contains no eggs and uses plant-based replacements for a fully vegan offering of mayos, dressings, cookies, and cookie dough that are available not just in health-obsessed places like Whole Foods but also Walmart and 7-Eleven and they can also be found in countries outside the U.S., including Mexico and Hong Kong. This year, Just is introducing new packaging designed in-house.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>We&#8217;ve said goodbye to our brown paper packaging and hello to a vibrant new look for all of our products. [&hellip;] From painterly mayo swipes and lush salad greens to mouth-watering cookies and cookie dough, our bottles and box graphics depict both the kitchen craft of food and the beauty of nature. This is a big departure, but it&#8217;s designed to benefit everyone from the store shelf-stocker to the everyday shopper.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/hampton-creek\/new-packaging-a-just-design-dc84eb4b1798\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hampton Creek post on Medium<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/just_logo_a.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Just done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/just_logo_guidelines_01.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Just done In-house\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/just_logo_guidelines_02.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Just done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sample guideline pages.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo was sort of okay&#8230; it wasn&#8217;t hurting anyone&#8230; perhaps gravity, with the heavy slant of its script but nothing too worrisome. Its biggest drawback was probably readability as it was a little on the light side, making it almost hard to discern as a logo. Thew new logo replaces the script for a customized Helvetica-ish wordmark. (They use Neue Haas Grotesk as their primary typeface, so most likely it comes from there). I&#8217;m no fan of Helvetica-ish logos, much less so of light-weight Helvetica-ish logos; there is something too <em>default<\/em> about them. This one, I don&#8217;t hate but I don&#8217;t like either and I know that it comes down to personal preference on the subject because there is nothing formally wrong with the logo and for a product called &#8220;Just&#8221;, using <em>just<\/em> an Helvetica-ish font seems appropriate. The period at the end of a lowercase word may drive some, like me, mad but, aesthetically, its connection to the tittle on the &#8220;j&#8221; might be the most interesting aspect of it.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/just_packaging_before.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Just done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Old packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/just_packaging_before_angle.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Just done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Old and new comparison.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old packaging played the artisanal, earthy, plant-based card heavily with the kraft labels and the somewhat naive typography. The plant-sprouting egg graphic was weird. As I mentioned before, the logo was hard to figure out it was a logo or the name of product &#8212; a problem that is very effectively fixed in the new packaging through a much clearer typographic hierarchy. Now you clearly see &#8220;Just&#8221; as the product name. The period, though, becomes a hindrance in being able to read the products as &#8220;Just Mayo&#8221; or &#8220;Just Cookies&#8221;.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/just_packaging_ice_cream_cookies.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Just done In-house\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/just_packaging_cookies_boxes.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Just done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Cookie and cookie dough packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>It took hundreds of swipes and every spare bottle we could find to arrive at the right ones to photograph our Just Mayo jars. If you look closely, complex flavors like Sriracha and Chipotle have more complex motion swipes than their simpler counterparts and the presence of subtle marks from the teeth of a knife add dimensionality to the labels.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/hampton-creek\/new-packaging-a-just-design-dc84eb4b1798\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hampton Creek post on Medium<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/just_mayo_illustrations.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Just done In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Mayo swipe explorations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>Our Just Dressing labels are no different.

I like how you can tell the mayo and dressings apart by the white or solid color backgrounds. Overall, the minimal typography and deadpan product photography on large swaths of metaphorical and literal white space has been done many times over, making this blend in with dozens other products, including private label brands but the redesign is undoubtedly a major improvement from what it was originally and there are some cool ideas and treatments going on that have the potential to develop into more interesting packaging, especially in the cookie department.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 2011, Hampton Creek is a manufacturer and distributor of plant-based foods whose principal range of products is sold as Just.
