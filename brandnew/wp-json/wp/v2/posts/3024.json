Around the world, one hundred million people work for a co-operative locally. The ICA is also responsible for managing the .coop top-level domain and controlling who uses it. In early 2013, ICA organized a contest where 30 firms competed to design a new identity for the organization and a new global logo that would unite co-operatives worldwide. The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.identity.coop\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">winning solution<\/a> was designed by London-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.calverts.coop\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Calverts<\/a> &mdash; a &#8220;worker co-operative with 12 members&#8221; &mdash; in collaboration with Buenos Aires-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.guerriniisland.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sebasti&aacute;n Guerrini<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>A visual alignment device for any co-operative business, big or small, anywhere in the world.

In other words, it was a pretty big fail even if we let it pass because of its good intentions. The new &#8220;coop&#8221; wordmark &mdash; serving both the alliance as an organizational mark and as a shareable mark among members &mdash; is a much more succinct and useful piece of identification that should help the ICA and its members establish a clearer and more unified presence. The wordmark is simple, small (only four letters!), and distinctive enough that it does have the potential of becoming a globally recognized logo. The logo itself is good but there is a clunkiness to the &#8220;p&#8221; that throws it off balance. The rounded terminals of the letters are clearly the result of checking the rounded-stroke-ending in Adobe Illustrator&#8217;s stroke palette and while it&#8217;s usually a permissible way to achieve this effect, here it looks really pronounced and distracting. Overall, though, the intention of the logo is solid and its simplicity should help its embrace from members (who probably don&#8217;t care about the technical nuances\/nuisances of rounded terminals).<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1895, the International Co-operative Alliance (ICA) is an &quot;independent, non-governmental organisation&quot; created &quot;to unite, represent and serve co-operatives worldwide.&quot; Co-operatives from one hundred countries are members of the ICA and collectively represent one billion individuals worldwide from every&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,79,26],"tags":[108,148,172],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3024"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3024"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3024\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3024"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3024"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3024"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
