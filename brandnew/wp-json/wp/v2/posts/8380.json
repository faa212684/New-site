Their product is completely natural, not tested on animals, and its packaging is plastic-free. The packaging, designed by London-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.2xelliott.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Two Times Elliott<\/a>, takes direct inspiration from the old school theater marquees of the West End and their deadpan, utilitarian typography. Typeset in Colophon Foundry&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.colophon-foundry.org\/typefaces\/transcript\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Transcript<\/a>, the boxes and tubes have  a striking simplicity thanks to a lack of any distractions and some really bold and intense colors &#8212; even the off-white, tan-ish color has a real depth to it. My favorite thing about this is how the text alignment vacillates between being centered, being full justified, and  sometimes simply being whatever it wants to be. From the design alone I would bet these things smell good. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/88496107\/AKT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Sonora by Abraham Lule<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_sonora.jpg\" alt=\"Sonora by Abraham Lule\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sonora-mexican.com.au\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sonora<\/a> is a Mexican restaurant in Potts Point, a suburb of Sydney, Australia. The brief for Brooklyn, NY-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.abrahamlule.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Abraham Lule<\/a> was to design a &#8220;retro-futuristic brand&#8221; which he interpreted as a wordmark that &#8220;carries a retro-pixel personality, while sharp edges and extreme weights add contrast&#8221;. Neither the brief nor the rationalization are&#8230; <em>normal<\/em>, which is a good thing because the logo has none of the visual trappings of most Mexican restaurants and instead does its own weird, cosmic thing. Except for the &#8220;N&#8221;, I love all of the characters, especially that &#8220;R&#8221;. The presentation of the project &#8212; many more photos of it at the link &#8212; is pretty fun too, in a faux desert-like landscape with a touch of surrealism, just the way I like my tacos. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/87821533\/Sonora\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Murero Bresciano by Moodley<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_murero.jpg\" alt=\"Murero Bresciano by Moodley\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/murerobresciano.at\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Murero Bresciano<\/a> is an architecture firm in Klagenfurt, Austria, working on residential, commercial, and public projects with a bold and minimal yet playful approach.
