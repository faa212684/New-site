No instructions or limitations are expressly written about whether you can or should squirt your flavored sparkling water with a liquid water enhancer. The new packaging has been designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pearlfisher.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pearlfisher<\/a> with lettering by <a href=\"http:\/\/siotes.com\/aquafina-flavorsplash\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Chris Ballasiotes<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>A vibrant new look and cheeky tone of voice that is celebratory and youthful, helping the brand compete in both the water and soft drink markets.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.pearlfisher.com\/live-item\/aquafina-new\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pearlfisher news page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/aquafina_flavorsplash_bottles_straight.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for Aquafina FlavorSplash by Pearlfisher\" \/>\n<figcaption>Aquafina Flavorsplash sparkling bottles.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/aquafina_flavorsplash_enhancers_straight.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for Aquafina FlavorSplash by Pearlfisher\" \/>\n<figcaption>Aquafina Flavorsplash liquid water enhancer squirting bottles.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/aquafina_flavorsplash_enhancers_with_hand.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for Aquafina FlavorSplash by Pearlfisher\" \/>\n<figcaption>To show proportion.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/aquafina_flavorsplash_all.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for Aquafina FlavorSplash by Pearlfisher\" \/>\n<figcaption>All together.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>I rarely focus on just packaging, there usually has to be some logo\/identity component to it that makes a project more of a, um, complete package. In this case, the &#8220;flavorsplash&#8221; logo is <a href=\"http:\/\/underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/aquafina_flavorsplash_logo.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">so bad<\/a> I&#8217;m just going to play as if it doesn&#8217;t exist nor does it appear on the otherwise great packaging.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/aquafina_flavorsplash_lettering_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for Aquafina FlavorSplash by Pearlfisher\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/aquafina_flavorsplash_lettering_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for Aquafina FlavorSplash by Pearlfisher\" \/>\n<figcaption>Details of the lettering by <a href=\"http:\/\/siotes.com\/aquafina-flavorsplash\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Chris Ballasiotes<\/a>.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">What attracted me to this line was the simplicity of it and the focus on the raw, energetic lettering &mdash; particularly in the bigger bottles where you can see some of the lovely texture. The tone-on-tone-on-tone approach &mdash; that third tone would be for the color of the drink &mdash; makes each flavor clearly distinguishable and helps maintain the restrained approach. And for a mass-market product these have relatively good pun-y names like &#8220;World Peach&#8221; and &#8220;Peelin&#8217; Good&#8221;. Overall, it&#8217;s a design that stands out from the more typical clinical look of flavored water without going the full-soda with crazy non-sensical graphics.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Originally launched in 2005 but discontinued shortly after, FlavorSplash is a revived line of beverages from Aquafina (owned by PepsiCo) of flavored sparkling water (available in 4-berry blend, orange citrus, and kiwi strawberry flavors) and liquid water enhancers (available in&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,51,26],"tags":[517,617,372,641],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3270"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3270"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3270\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3270"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3270"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3270"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
