What it lacks in human beings it makes up for in charm, with a town center still laid out in its medieval form with boutique shops and restaurants. Facing competition from other, nearby small towns with their own charms and looking to increase daytrip and overnight-stay visitors, the Shropshire Council and Shropshire Tourism decided it was time to establish a brand for the town and they worked with London-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.andsmithdesign.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">&amp; Smith<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.weallneedwords.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">We All Need Words<\/a> to design it. One of the town&#8217;s attractions is its sixteenth-century Tudor architecture: houses with black and white timber facades in geometric patterns, which served as one of the main elements of the new identity.<\/p>\n<!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/shrewsbury_building.jpg\" alt=\"Shrewsbury Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Example of Shrewsbury&#8217;s Tudor buildings. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/daf_newport\/430603650\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Photo by daf_newport<\/a>.

The Tudor buildings (Shrewsbury has more original Tudor buildings than Chester), the surprises (you&#8217;ll find a medieval cellar in McDonald&#8217;s), and the new one-offs springing up all over the town. An independent coffeehouse, an artisan bakery that&#8217;s open until the loaves sell out, a wine shop that&#8217;s been in the same family since 1842, a 1500s home with 1990s carvings of Mick Jagger and Margaret Thatcher in its beams, a cartoon festival, a folk festival&#8230; and so the one-offs continue.<br \/>&mdash; Press Release, Provided<\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/shrewsbury_overview.jpg\" alt=\"Shrewsbury Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<blockquote>From the start, Shropshire Tourism made it clear that they wanted something local businesses could use. So the agencies created &#8216;A Shrewsbury One-Off Since&#8230;&#8217; icon and stamp to promote one-offs across the town and in maps, brochures and advertising. The line can be used to show how old something is: since 1586. To show that something is new: since 2012. Or to say that a cake was baked earlier this morning: since 6.30am.<br \/>&mdash; Press Release, Provided<\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/shrewsbury_stamp.jpg\" alt=\"Shrewsbury Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/shrewsbury_cake.jpg\" alt=\"Shrewsbury Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<blockquote>&amp; SMITH created business cards cut from a large, original pattern. No two business cards have the same pattern on the back, so they&#8217;re all one-offs. The black-and-white pattern nods to the town&#8217;s Tudor buildings but with a modern, graphic update. This also stands out from the bright and breezy identities other towns and places use. The graphic pattern was also adapted to be a part of the Efra typeface (Shrewsbury&#8217;s typeface for headlines).<br \/>&mdash; Press Release, Provided<\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/shrewsbury_cards.jpg\" alt=\"Shrewsbury Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/shrewsbury_guide.jpg\" alt=\"Shrewsbury Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/shrewsbury_newpaper-ad.jpg\" alt=\"Shrewsbury Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/shrewsbury_chain-store.jpg\" alt=\"Shrewsbury Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/shrewsbury_bags.jpg\" alt=\"Shrewsbury Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<p>One of the main reasons I am posting this project is to contrast it against Monday&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/czech_republike_more_like_czech_republicant.php\">Czech Republike<\/a> project because <em>this<\/em> is how you do destination branding. You find something that is particularly unique to a place and then you bring it alive in a way that is not just a regurgitation but a contemporary interpretation. The main element of the identity &mdash; the Tudor architecture-inspired pattern &mdash; is stunning, bold, and flexible. I love how it looks as a whole background but I especially like how it can be broken into tiny bits and used as stand-alone squares and circles, working nicely as replacement for letters too. The typography is simple and unobtrusive, acting as a delivery mechanism for great photography and sharp writing. The other aspect of the bigger brand scheme, the &#8220;A Shrewsbury One-Off Since&hellip;&#8221; stamp, feels like it&#8217;s a whole other project, with its own typeface and aesthetic; I like the idea and I love that businesses can use it without any expense and be part of the brand, but I wish it felt more integrated to the rest of the look. Nonetheless, this is very handsome, relevant, and appropriate work.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/shrewsbury_clients.jpg\" alt=\"Shrewsbury Logo and Identity\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Clients enjoying the work. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.shropshirestar.com\/news\/2012\/07\/02\/tudor-theme-chosen-to-promote-shrewsbury-tourism\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Source<\/a>.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_120718_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_120718_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_120718_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_120718_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[64,12,26],"tags":[45,179,228,654],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2053"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2053"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2053\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2053"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2053"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2053"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
