San Francisco based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.minesf.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MINE&trade;<\/a>, run by identity fiend Christopher Simmons, got that chance with the redesign of <a href=\"http:\/\/cafilm.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The California Film Institute&#8217;s<\/a> (CFI) identity, as well as that of its 29-going-on-30-year-old <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mvff.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mill Valley Film Festival<\/a> (MVFF), <em>plus<\/em> an update of the institute&#8217;s education program and the Rafael Film Center&#8217;s. The opportunity to work on all these logos at the same time proved to be the most beneficial for CFI, as it was rewarded with a cohesive visual family of brands that respond to their place and context.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cfi_family.gif\" alt=\"Family of Logos\" \/><\/p>\n<blockquote>[MINE&trade;] took their cues from the landmark signage of the local <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/tspauld\/384240048\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rafael Theatre<\/a> (designed by Mark Fox) which is operated by CFI and plays home to the Mill Valley Film Festival. &#8220;Even though the festival attracts filmmakers and stars from more than 49 countries, at its heart it is a local experience,&#8221; Simmons explains, &#8220;By capturing some of the local typography and colors we&#8217;re reinforcing that sense of place that is central to the festival&#8217;s identity.&#8221;<\/blockquote>\n<p>At the heart, in more ways than one, of the project is the identity for the MVFF: A lovely multi-stroke, brightly-colored <em>MV<\/em>, punctuated by a heart, that, in contrast to the previous identity by Futurebrand, conveys a sense of passion and pride, while being unique and dynamic. From the MVFF&#8217;s visual gestures, the rest of the identities follow suit with carefully rendered inlines and unified by the use of Gotham and Gotham Rounded. <\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cfi_logo.gif\" alt=\"The California Film Institute Logo, Before and After\"\/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/education_logo.gif\" alt=\"The California Film Institute Education Program Logo, Before and After\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In collaboration with CFI&#8217;s advertising firm, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.scheyer.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Scheyer\/SF<\/a>, MINE&trade; also developed a poster that further builds on the tradition of the festival and its decades-long contribution to local culture by emphasizing its 30 year birthday. In this application the MVFF logo shines even more, as a distinct and impactful mark in its field of rough black &mdash; plus anything looks great set against 300 point type in bright magenta.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mvff_poster.jpg\" alt=\"MVFF Poster\" \/><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,63,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/543"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=543"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/543\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=543"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=543"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=543"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
