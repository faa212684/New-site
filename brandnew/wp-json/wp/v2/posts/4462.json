Their previous logo was a wordmark typeset all in blackletter &mdash; you can still see it on their website &mdash; that looks more like a newspaper masthead than a maker of deliciousness. Designed by the Barcelona office of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wearemucho.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mucho<\/a>, the new logo revolves around a fantastic blackletter &#8220;P&#8221; that emphasizes the Pons family name and serves as a luxurious monogram for the applications. The complementary photography of the bombones against baby blue and mint green backgrounds provides a great and fun contrast. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wearemucho.com\/en\/project\/bomboneria-pons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Non\u00f4 by Pentagram<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_nono.jpg\" alt=\"Non\u00f4 by Pentagram\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">Non\u00f4 &mdash; who goes by one name like Cher and Madonna &mdash; is the owner of Barraca de Praia, a beach stall that provides the chairs, parasols, and drinks at Praia da Joatinga, a beach in  Rio, Brazil. Designed by Pentagram partner Marina Willer, Non\u00f4 now has the best logo of a beach stall EVER. How does a beach stall end up with a logo designed by a global design firm? Marina, who hails from Brazil, has a house that overlooks the beach and has noticed the hard work Non\u00f4 and his family put into taking care of this secluded beach, so she and her team designed it as a gift. Not only is the story heartwarming and awesome but so is the logo, a playful wordmark made of the same repeating boomerang shape in three different sizes that manages to create the two necessary letters and circumflex mark. It&#8217;s a fantastically fun logo rendered in the perfect color combination of yellow, pink, and orange. This could easily be an identity for something massive but it&#8217;s quite charming that it&#8217;s for a tiny beach stall. For the brand implementation and rollout Non\u00f4 received a set of stencils to apply to his chairs, parasols, and other things, and it will be phased in over time.  <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pentagram.com\/#\/blog\/127919\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Sneaky Veg by Vicki Turner<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_sneakyveg.jpg\" alt=\"Sneaky Veg by Vicki Turner\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.sneakyveg.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sneaky Veg<\/a> is the personal blog of Mandy, mom to three kids and sneaker of vegetables into their food. Despite having a smallish following, her blog has an identity that would rival (and trump) most of the larger so-called &#8220;Mommy Blogs&#8221;, thanks to the work of London-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.vicki-turner.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Vicki Turner<\/a>. The identity features a logo that is a charming rendition of a carrot and apple looking like an ice cream cone with additional illustrations playing off of the same theme of fruits and vegetables coming together to pass off as treats, like donuts or hard candy. The illustration work is lively and joyful with complementing photography that looks warm and rustic. Great identity for a worthy blog.  <a href=\"http:\/\/www.vicki-turner.com\/sneaky-veg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"A good range of fun work for a diverse range of clients with work from Barcelona, London, and London again&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[1236,600,882],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4462"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4462"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4462\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4462"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4462"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4462"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
