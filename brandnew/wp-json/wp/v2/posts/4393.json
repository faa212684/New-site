United<\/a> is an American professional soccer club based in Washington, D.C., and one of the ten original charter clubs of Major League Soccer (MSL). Although not as successful recently, the Black-and-Red (as they are nicknamed), has been one of most winning teams in MLS scoring numerous titles and even competing convincingly in international tournaments, winning the 1998 CONCACAF Champions&#8217; Cup. Last week, the team <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dcunited.com\/newDCU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">introduced<\/a> a new logo with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.redpeakgroup.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Red Peak Group<\/a> leading the brand strategy and logo design process, initial design development by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.elementadvertising.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Element Advertising<\/a>, and final version by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.horridge.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Peter Horridge Design<\/a>.

(They really need to avoid using the silhouette of the logo because it looks like the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=leprechaun+movie&#038;source=lnms&#038;tbm=isch&#038;sa=X&#038;ved=0ahUKEwiB8J6t4t3JAhUJWCYKHXhfAf8Q_AUIBygB&#038;biw=1381&#038;bih=869\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">leprechaun from <em>Leprechaun<\/em><\/a>.)<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Unless you are heavily nostalgic and a die-hard D.C. United fan I think it&#8217;s easy to consider the new logo an improvement. The condensed Didone of the previous logo was far too editorial for a sports logo and the drawing of the eagle was completely out of proportion, with a tiny head and huge wings, floating in an extra large shield. The new logo fixes all of these issues with a nicely consolidated mark that integrates all elements better and in a more streamlined approach. The one weird thing is the hourglass-shaped tail of the eagle where the stars and stripes of the Washington flag sit; not sure how it should have been solved but that approach yields a strange shape. The wordmark is simple and strong, keeping the condensed structure of the previous one and manages to avoid being full-on sports typography.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/i_R0Fc9JblI\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Video from the logo unveil party.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/dc_united_merch.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for D.C.
