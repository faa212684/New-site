I realize this is more product line than brand but the design is carried with the same kind of consistency and unity across SKUs that it sort of qualifies&#8230; and, dammit, it&#8217;s awesome to look at. Designed by Yokohama, Japan-based <a href=\"http:\/\/nosigner.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nosigner<\/a>, the logo is a fairly barebones serif with a simple &#8220;TT&#8221; ligature and some kind of accompanying compass that I guess plots. Combined with the sans serif font and the stark orange and black color palette, it&#8217;s a lovely design system and I want one of every size. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/56734191\/PLOTTER\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">PNB by Bratus<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_pnb.jpg\" alt=\"PNB by Bratus\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/PNB-Design-Build\/1677466972515154\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PNB<\/a> is an architecture, interior, and landscape studio based in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Their identity by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/bratus.co\/works\/pnb.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bratus<\/a> features a hard-geometry logo with displaced stems that give it a heavily engineered look but softened by the brown and salmon color palette, creating a nice combination of earthy tones with the more manufactured aesthetic. The print applications have a cool gimmick where the the stem of the &#8220;p&#8221; is die-cut that is particularly fun on the business cards mostly because it photographs so well. The super loose letter-spacing on the business cards gives me pause but I would still hire these folks to landscape my property. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/bratus.co\/works\/pnb.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Academia by Darling Visual Communications<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_academia.jpg\" alt=\"Academia by Darling Visual Communications\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/academia.com.sg\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Academia<\/a> is an English and writing center in Singapore and if their name doesn&#8217;t inspire you to think education, then their identity by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/darling.sg\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Darling Visual Communications<\/a> will. It exudes academia-ness. I realize this isn&#8217;t the most visually exciting Friday Like but the balance of all the elements is quite nice, starting with an elegant serif, a deep hued color palette, and an unapologetically shield-ish shield (the eye is a little creepy, though). The cloth-bound kraft notebooks are pretty sweet too&#8230; they would make a great line for Designphil.
