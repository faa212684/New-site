Truth be told, the woes of its football team should be the least of the city of Detroit&#8217;s worries, but few things can bring the citizens together as an exciting sports franchise and the Lions are doing whatever they can to bring a little bit of hope to Detroit, and a new identity for the Lions may not be the salvation but at least it&#8217;s a diversion. Yesterday&#8217;s media announcement of the new logo would have been more climactic had the logo not been leaked by the NFL itself nearly a month ago when the store posted a toy 18-wheeler featuring the new logo.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/detroit_lions_toy_truck.jpg\" alt=\"Detroit Lions Toy Truck\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Toy truck at NFL.com with leaked Lions logo; <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.mlive.com\/highlightreel\/2009\/03\/and_the_winner_of_the_new_detr.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">news broke here<\/a>.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Certainly, we could have posted the story back then, but there was absolutely no supporting images and just a crappy low resolution rendering of the actual logo. Plus, a disappearing image of a toy truck wasn&#8217;t much of a certain lead to go on, so I decided to sit on the story and wait for the official announcement. If only to get a better look at the lion.<\/p>\n<blockquote>As part of the new comprehensive brand, the Lions also introduced a new logotype and a new proprietary font, &#8220;NFL Lions.&#8221; The new logotype is additional imagery that presents the Lions brand and will be featured in such prominent places as the endzone marking at Ford Field. [&hellip;] The new identity retains many important aspects of our history in terms of our primary mark and our colors. However, the evolution allows us to present our Lions brand and visual identity in new, versatile and distinctive ways.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.detroitlions.com\/document_display.cfm?document_id=483672\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press Release<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/detroit_lions_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"Detroit Lions Logo, Detail\" \/><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/detroit_lions_logo_slick.gif\" onclick=\"window.open('https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/detroit_lions_logo_slick.gif','popup','width=788,height=608,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/detroit_lions_logo_slick_sm.gif\" alt=\"Detroit Lions, Logo Slick\" border=\"0\"\/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Click on image for bigger view.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/detroit_lions_logo_lettering.gif\" alt=\"Detroit Lions Typeface\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>A few sample words set in the &#8220;NFL Lions&#8221; typeface.

I have to admit that I deeply enjoyed how strict the new lion remains to the original and presents a simple evolution without resorting to the animal pyrotechnic drawings that plagues most professional sports team identities. You can&#8217;t help but appreciate how big a difference a few white lines can do for Bubbles, as the lion is nicknamed. You can argue whether it&#8217;s the right drawing for a lion, but whoever designed this new mark did a good job in working with the cards they were dealt.<\/p>\n<p>The furry typeface is fine, I guess, they did need some extravagant display of design and the &#8220;NFL Lions&#8221; typeface is pretty restrained for what it wants to do.

To be honest, there isn&#8217;t anything very interesting about this whole identity, it&#8217;s pretty competent and is inoffensive, but the two dozen or so e-mails I have in my inbox prove that &mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/torrentfreak.com\/x-men-leak-downloaded-over-a-million-times-090406\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">not unlike a certain <em>X-Men<\/em> movie that also got leaked<\/a> &mdash; a little media buzz on the subject of identity design goes a long way.<\/p>\n<p>Below are some images from yesterday&#8217;s announcement.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/detroit_lions_01.jpg\" alt=\"Detroit Lions, News Images\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.southernledger.com\/ap\/259572\/New_Detroit_logo_features_fiercer_leaping_lion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Image source<\/a>.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/detroit_lions_02.jpg\" alt=\"Detroit Lions, News Images\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mlive.com\/lions\/index.ssf\/2009\/04\/lions_transformation_continues.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Image source<\/a>.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/detroit_lions_03.jpg\" alt=\"Detroit Lions, News Images\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/detroit_lions_04.jpg\" alt=\"Detroit Lions, News Images\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.wwj.com\/pages\/4235726.php?imageGalleryXRefId=1040438\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Image source<\/a>.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/detroit_lions_05.jpg\" alt=\"Detroit Lions, News Images\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.detroitlions.com\/index.cfm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Image source<\/a>.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/detroit_lions_06.jpg\" alt=\"Detroit Lions, News Images\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.detroitlions.com\/document_display.cfm?document_id=483681\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Image source<\/a>.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,26,87],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/817"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=817"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/817\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=817"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=817"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=817"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
