There are now 14 locations across Canada &#8212; including Montr\u00e9al, Toronto, and Vancouver &#8212; where they have one of their three establishments: Eatery, for brunch, lunch, and sweets; Sweet House, with all kinds of sweet treats; and Dip Shop, serving ice cream dipped in chocolate. They also sell their own products, including bars, dips\/fondues, and hot cocoa powders. Last year, Cacao 70 introduced a new identity and packaging designed by Montr\u00e9al- and Tokyo-based <a href=\"https:\/\/weareingoodcompany.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">In Good Company<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cacao_70_old_look.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Cacao 70 by In Good Company\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sample of old look.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>For Cacao 70, we created a whole new brand strategy, going to market strategy, and visual identity to fit their ambitions. A whimsical world, to make us dream and be transported to new flavours.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/weareingoodcompany.com\/cacao-70\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">In Good Company project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cacao_70_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Cacao 70 by In Good Company\" \/>\n<figcaption>Wordmark.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cacao_70_logo_full.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Cacao 70 by In Good Company\" \/>\n<figcaption>Full logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cacao_70_logo_system.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Cacao 70 by In Good Company\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo system.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo was a bad interpretation of <a href=\"http:\/\/logos.wikia.com\/wiki\/The_Coffee_Bean_%26_Tea_Leaf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the old Coffee Bean &amp; Tea Leaf logo<\/a> with some misplaced corporate type &#8212; that &#8220;CACAO 70&#8221; wordmark was like something you would see on the cover of a telco brochure. Clearly, their logo (or old look) didn&#8217;t stop them from growing and delivering great chocolate but with the new logo (and look) the identity matches a lot better what seems to be a delicious product. The wordmark is done in an elegant, beautiful, and striking chiseled serif where each character has a great personality of its own &#8212; those &#8220;C&#8221;s! &#8212; and it also happens to be a great combination of repeating characters, two &#8220;C&#8221;s, two &#8220;A&#8221;s, and basically two &#8220;O&#8221;s, with the &#8220;7&#8221; adding a similar angle to the &#8220;A&#8221;. Anyway, too much rhapsodizing about that wordmark. In addition, there is a chocolate-churner icon that is kind of awkward, lacking the elegance and crispness of the wordmark, which is a little unfortunate as it appears everywhere. I mean, it&#8217;s not horrible, but it stands out in the wrong way.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cacao_70_identity_elements.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Cacao 70 by In Good Company\" \/>\n<figcaption>Identity elements.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cacao_70_illustrations_type.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Cacao 70 by In Good Company\" \/>\n<figcaption>Illustration style and typographic arrangements.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cacao_70_bars_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Cacao 70 by In Good Company\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cacao_70_bars_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Cacao 70 by In Good Company\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cacao_70_bars_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Cacao 70 by In Good Company\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cacao_70_bars_04.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Cacao 70 by In Good Company\" \/>\n<figcaption>Bars.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The chocolate bars are like a mid-week Friday Likes treat.
