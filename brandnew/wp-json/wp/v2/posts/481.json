With <a href=\"http:\/\/www.daysinn.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Days Inn<\/a>, I have nothing. And it&#8217;s not because I scoff at budget hotels; I have stayed at my share of low-priced hotels and I may have even stayed at a Days Inn for all I know, but I would never know, since their branding seems so low-key&hellip; and it has been so, at least, for the past 37 years, when <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Days_Inn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Days Inn was founded in 1970<\/a> and was granted its first (and, until now, only) identity. This past February, Days Inn <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hotelmotel.com\/hotelmotel\/article\/articleDetail.jsp?id=405348\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">unveiled its new logo<\/a> to 1,800 of its managers and owners. The new identity helps support the chain&#8217;s &#8220;A Promise as Sure as the Sun&#8221; brand promise and, to boot, because the shape is nearly identical, it won&#8217;t break the bank: &#8220;We kept what was good and powerful in our logo &mdash; the unique and familiar shape and the warm yellow sun &mdash; but freshened up the look,&#8221; says Chris Trick, VP of marketing, &#8220;By preserving the shape of the logo we were able to keep signage replacement costs at a minimum since there is no need for franchisees to replace the physical signage container if still in good condition.&#8221; The old logo clearly needed a refresh, the dark frame made it feel like one of those motels where you could be murdered in your sleep or in the shower; the typography was uninviting and stodgy; and the sun looked more like a <strong>50% off!<\/strong> starburst than an actual sun. Now it feels fresher &mdash; maybe <em>too<\/em> fresh? &mdash; and more inviting. But, funny, I still feel no connection.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks to DesignMaven for the tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,73,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/481"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=481"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/481\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=481"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=481"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=481"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
