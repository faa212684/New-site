The identity, designed by Chihuahua, Mexico-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/estudioyeye\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Estudio Yeye<\/a> is an eccentric combination of things: a thin wordmark that has some interesting non-round proportions and spacing, an extra bold headline typeface, a lovely waterlily illustration, and a range of odd illustrations and icons taken from Buddhist culture. As I was about to write that the identity had a kind of mystical yet casual vibe, I just noticed that on one of their project images that&#8217;s what the caption reads. It&#8217;s like a serene, trippin&#8217;, upscale, punk aesthetic that doesn&#8217;t quite make sense but it&#8217;s captivating nonetheless. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/65055053\/Ubon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Watson Morgan by Vencho Miloshevski<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_watsonmorgan.jpg\" alt=\"Watson Morgan by Vencho Miloshevski\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">Watson Morgan is a small clothing brand based in Chesterfiled, MI. (Sorry, no website available). Designed by Macedonia-based <a href=\"https:\/\/venchomiloshevski.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Vencho Miloshevski<\/a>, I doubt this will be a large crowd pleaser but I found the typography to have just the right amount of extra flair to be interesting, taking a common extended wordmark and slightly thickening the horizontal strokes. I also liked the application of the logo extra large across the letterhead and bottom of the bags. The typography becomes even more interesting in the lowercase letters&#8230; would love to see more of this identity, if it does exist in the real world. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/the-brandidentity.com\/feed\/watson-morgan-vencho-miloshevski\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Monjecitos by Futura<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_monjecitos.jpg\" alt=\"Monjecitos by Futura\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/monjecitos.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Monjecitos<\/a> (a weird name that translates as cute, little monks) is a company in Mexico that specializes in making yeasts for craft beer brewing. The identity, designed by Mexico City-based <a href=\"http:\/\/byfutura.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Futura<\/a> takes a playful approach to the identity &#8212; given the name this could have gone dark and medieval &#8212; with a fun logo where hops\/barley\/wheat sprigs spring into bubbling test tubes. I know it&#8217;s not highfalutin&#8217; design but it&#8217;s pleasing. The applications have a sort of clinical presentation but with a name like little monks it&#8217;s hard not to take it in with a dose of the intended irony. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/65857347\/Monjecitos\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"A varied selection of projects and industries this week with work from Chihuahua, Macedonia, and Mexico City&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[69,11,85,86,26],"tags":[186,261,564],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6551"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=6551"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6551\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=6551"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=6551"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=6551"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
