This past September 14, General elections were held in Sweden where said party won after playing the opposition for eight years &mdash; a title given to the largest party <em>not<\/em> in government, as opposed to them being some kind of militia or Anonymous-like org. (Just thought it would be good to clear up that &#8220;opposition&#8221; moniker). In 2013, Stockholm-based <a href=\"http:\/\/snask.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Snask<\/a> began working with SSU to create a unified identity to gear up for this election.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>We translated the SSU brand platform into a spanking new graphic identity. The identity was launched a few month&#8217;s before the start of the swedish general election campaign, enabling all proud members the right tools to create communications material. Most importantly, we unified all members of SSU under one brand and one coherent graphic identity. The identity has so far been used in tv-adverts, by members in the pride parade, in printed campaign material and in thousands of campaign activities all over Sweden. SSU&#8217;s mother party the Social Democrats won the government election of 2014 after eight years in opposition.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/snask.com\/case\/ssu\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Snask project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ssu_logo_detail_01.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for SSU by Snask\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The ribbon is thought as something with a political feel where ribbons have always been linked to statements.

The new acronym sitting on a red ribbon certainly feels more stately and there is something interesting about using such a basic graphic device which most designers avoid for that very reason. It&#8217;s almost too original in its unoriginality. If that makes any sense. It&#8217;s obviously the application that makes this logo work, though.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ssu_identity_elements_04.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for SSU by Snask\" \/>\n<figcaption>Identity elements.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ssu_various_applications_05.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for SSU by Snask\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ssu_various_applications_02_06.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for SSU by Snask\" \/>\n<figcaption>Various identity materials.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ssu_posters_07.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for SSU by Snask\" \/>\n<figcaption>Posters.
