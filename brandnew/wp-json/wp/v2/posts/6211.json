The original shape of the shield has been replaced by a more pleasant and simple oval, which coincides with the new collection of R\u00fcckl&#8217;s new artistic director Rony Plesl. While the linear bird retained elegant silhouette and the plug in its beak, the bottle of pharma glass disappeared from the logo together with its position of the company&#8217;s main product. The black and white reproduces the color of the stork&#8217;s wings and is supplemented by light apricot.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/60464431\/Rueckl-Visual-Identity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Studio Najbrt project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ruckl_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for R\u00fcckl by Studio Najbrt\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ruckl_logo_black.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for R\u00fcckl by Studio Najbrt\" \/>\n<figcaption>On black.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The company employed two separate logos previously: the stork logo in a shield shape and a script-ish logo. Neither shined for their execution. The old stork logo had a very odd crest shape and was surrounded by some heavy typography and confined to a rectangle. The type-based logo was a whack combination of a funky script-italic thing and a terrible slab serif. Neither one of the logos hinted at the quality or delicateness of the product, something the new logo is able to capture beautifully in a minimal, crisp redrawing of the stork, using a thin-line approach that echoes the thickness of a glass rim.<\/p>\n<p>The stork loses some of its original meaning with the removal of the apothecary bottle and makes it rather unclear what it is holding in its beak. At first I thought it was some kind of giant nail before I had paid close attention to the old logo, then I thought it was a dagger, and eventually I realized it was the cap of the bottle. To old customers this might not be an issue but I can&#8217;t imagine that R\u00fcckl has a ton of repeat customers since fancy glass is not something you buy on a recurring schedule. To new customers it might not even be an issue either since they are there for the glass but to designers on a logo blog, it does raise questions about how easy or hard it is to interpret. Nonetheless, the execution is quite nice. The oval holding shape makes it feel contemporary, along with the sans serif wordmark that I kinda wish was a hair lighter to match the thickness of the oval and the stork.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ruckl_stationery.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for R\u00fcckl by Studio Najbrt\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stationery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ruckl_brochure.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for R\u00fcckl by Studio Najbrt\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brochure.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ruckl_glass.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for R\u00fcckl by Studio Najbrt\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ruckl_glass_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for R\u00fcckl by Studio Najbrt\" \/>\n<figcaption>On glass.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ruckl_bag.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for R\u00fcckl by Studio Najbrt\" \/>\n<figcaption>Bag.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ruckl_packaging_new_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for R\u00fcckl by Studio Najbrt\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ruckl_packaging_new_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for R\u00fcckl by Studio Najbrt\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ruckl_packaging_new_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for R\u00fcckl by Studio Najbrt\" \/>\n<figcaption>Packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ruckl_store.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for R\u00fcckl by Studio Najbrt\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ruckl_store_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for R\u00fcckl by Studio Najbrt\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ruckl_store_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for R\u00fcckl by Studio Najbrt\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ruckl_store_04.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for R\u00fcckl by Studio Najbrt\" \/>\n<figcaption>Retail presence.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">The applications are very straightforward, basically placing the logo front, top, and center everywhere possible but it all works elegantly and appropriately.
