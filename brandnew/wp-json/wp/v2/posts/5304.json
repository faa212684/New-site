The name means &#8220;evoke&#8221; in English. The identity, designed by Le\u00f3n, Guanajuato-based <a href=\"http:\/\/treceveintestudio.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Treceveinte<\/a>, aims to conjure an elegant, treasure-like feeling with a classic, chiseled serif that has rich, wide, open counterspaces and a lovely icon that&#8217;s a combination of fountain pen with lines symbolizing paragraphs in the shape of an &#8220;E&#8221;. I like that it also looks like a flag but above all I really like squiggle texture of the lines. The icon also has an ex-libris, vintage-publishing-house aesthetic that&#8217;s great. The gold foil on the gray stock looks lovely as does the off-white stock. The typography throughout the applications is crisp and, well, literary. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/treceveintestudio.com\/portafolio\/evoca\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Combo Combo by BVD<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_combocombo.jpg\" alt=\"Combo Combo by BVD\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/combocombose\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Combo Combo<\/a> is a pizza\/salad\/wrap fast casual restaurant in Norrk\u00f6ping, Sweden, that, as the name implies, allows customers to easily create their combo of toppings. Designed by Stockholm, Sweden-based <a href=\"http:\/\/bvd.se\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BVD<\/a>, the logo makes good use of the name by rotating &#8220;COMBO&#8221; 180 degrees in a deadpan sans serif, creating an intriguing set of counterspaces. One of the &#8220;O&#8221;s gets turned into a face which, although perhaps unnecessary, adds a quirky secondary element to the identity that also happens to look like a pizza with three really large pepperoni slices. What sealed the deal for me was the custom metal logo grill inside the oven. That&#8217;s boss. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/bvd.se\/combo-combo\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Lewis Miller Design by Project M Plus<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_lewismillerdesign.jpg\" alt=\"Lewis Miller Design by Project M Plus\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/lewismillerdesign.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lewis Miller Design<\/a> is an event and floral design company based in New York, NY, with a large team conceiving and deploying rich, epic, elegant floral arrangements &#8212; traits reflected in their identity, designed by Los Angeles, CA-based <a href=\"http:\/\/projectmplus.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Project M Plus<\/a>. The logo is an elegant wordmark typeset in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.grillitype.com\/typefaces\/gt-sectra\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GT Sectra<\/a> and is complemented by a classic monogram of interlocking LMD serif letters. The exuberance of the floral arrangements is expressed through close-up photographs of flowers printed with gold foil on top to create a whirring layering effect. The business card and letterhead have a hipster-y but elegant 90-degree-increment layout and the bags look great in that rich blue color, but my favorite element might be the tape. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/projectmplus.com\/m-designs\/lewis-miller-design\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Plenty of elegance this week with work from Le\u00f3n, Stockholm, and Los Angeles&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,82,85,26],"tags":[1379,41,1380,564],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5304"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=5304"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5304\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=5304"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=5304"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=5304"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
