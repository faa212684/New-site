While Hamburg, Germany-based Paperlux has <a href=\"http:\/\/www.paperlux.com\/en\/projects\/branding\/abhati-suisse-productline\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">designed their full product line<\/a> it was the design for Abhati Suisse&#8217;s line of scented candles, <a href=\"https:\/\/abhatisuisse.com\/gifts\/10\/candle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Purvanchal<\/a>, that caught my attention. The candle comes in a simple white box in thin paper that is held together by an absolutely beautiful patterned tape that contrasts so well against the starkness of the paper and the minimal typography that wraps around, at an angle, like the rest of the product packaging. This is the kind of packaging one feels bad about throwing out. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/31547973\/ABHATI-SUISSE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Sweet Greek by StudioBrave<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_sweetgreek.jpg\" alt=\"Sweet Greek by StudioBrave\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.sweetgreek.com.au\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sweet Greek<\/a> is a food enterprise in Melbourne, Australia, that brings Greek products and cuisine to the city&#8217;s Prahran Market, while also offering catering and serving as the source for owner Kathy Tsaples&#8217;s cookbooks. The identity, designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/studiobrave.com.au\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">StudioBrave<\/a> is charming, sweet, and friendly with a hand-drawn approach that gives the company an earthy vibe that matches the rustic-ness of their food offerings. The olive branch drawing is really nice&#8230; I wish the &#8220;SG&#8221; monogram were a little thicker in that instance to balance out with the leaves but it still makes for a great logo. Bonus points for drawing four different &#8220;E&#8221;s. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/studiobrave.com.au\/project\/sweet-greek\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Nativo by Candid Brands<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_nativo.jpg\" alt=\"Nativo by Candid Brands\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">In other food news&#8230; <a href=\"http:\/\/nativomerida.mx\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nativo<\/a>, in M\u00e9rida, Mexico, specializes in cooked-for-eight-hours-underground pig while offering accompanying hand-pressed juices and &#8220;recado&#8221;, a type of mole.

It&#8217;s a bit off of the Anagrama playbook but, hey, there are worse playbooks to work from.
