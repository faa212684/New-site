As one of those companies, Hyperloop is a global team comprised of more than 800 engineers, creatives, and technologists, that has developed a frictionless electromagnetic levitation technology that can propel passengers and freight at up to 760 miles per hour (1223 km\/h), making traveling in pods inside tubes at hyper speed a reality. With a full-scale testing facility in Toulouse, France, the company has at least 10 projects around the world in the works, many of them still in the feasibility study phase, including a HyperloopTT between Chicago, IL, and Cleveland, OH, and a 3-mile elevated system in Abu Dhabi, UAE, expected to begin construction this year. Entering a significant phase of growth, HyperloopTT has introduced a new identity designed by <a href=\"https:\/\/saffron-consultants.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Saffron<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>Honing in on the tangible benefits HyperloopTT will bring to passengers&#8217; lives, the concept is built around the creation of &#8216;More&#8217;. By delivering the next breakthrough in mobility, Hyperloop will make peoples&#8217; lives more frictionless, empowering people to have more time, choice and freedom.<br \/><br \/>The brand identity moves beyond tropes of speed which crowd the market. Instead, the brand assets employ a principle of &#8216;more&#8217; to create a distinctive wordmark, iconic symbol and design toolkit that differentiates HyperloopTT from competitors, essential during this stage of their rapid progress.<br \/><br \/>Equipped with a visual language and inspirational art direction that reflect their vision, the talented international team can bolster their revolutionary technology with the added security lent by a coherent experience. The guidelines set the course for an identity that will help the company build credibility with a consistency across all platforms.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/saffron-consultants.com\/projects\/hyperlooptt\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Saffron project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/HyperloopTT_brand_principles.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Brand principles.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/HyperloopTT_train_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for HyperloopTT by Saffron\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/HyperloopTT_train_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for HyperloopTT by Saffron\" \/>\n<figcaption>The pod.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/HyperloopTT_logo_a.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for HyperloopTT by Saffron\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\" style=\"width:48.5%;padding-bottom:48.5%;float:left\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/HyperloopTT_Logo_Detail.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div><div class=\"video-container\" style=\"width:48.5%;padding-bottom:48.5%;float:right\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/HyperloopTT_Logo_Detail_02.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div><div class=\"clear\"><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo details.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/HyperloopTT_logo_animation.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo animation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo was the Terminator&#8217;s version of fast, with a futuristic wordmark with spikes and pieces missing. Granted, it was fine, but not very sophisticated. The new logo corrects that with a slick- and precise-looking wordmark that, while not visually super exciting, is very nicely crafted and while it&#8217;s a traditional bare sans serif it has two details that make it unique. The flat swash of the &#8220;R&#8221; is unexpected and surprisingly good, mostly because it&#8217;s right before the &#8220;L&#8221;, so it echoes the long horizontal stroke. The &#8220;T&#8221;s add a great sense of dimensionality by casting a shadow on the stems making it look as if the two horizontal strokes are floating, just like the pods. It&#8217;s a great logo that subtly hints at the key aspects of the company while looking dead serious. The animation is all kinds of good with the horizontal strokes of the &#8220;T&#8221;s moving as if they were inside the tunnel.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\" style=\"padding-bottom: 44.75%;\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/HyperloopTT_typography.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Typography.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/HyperloopTT_icon_set.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for HyperloopTT by Saffron\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icon set.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/HyperloopTT_badge_set.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for HyperloopTT by Saffron\" \/>\n<figcaption>Badge set.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>I&#8217;m not really sure when or where these badges are used but it&#8217;s my favorite part of the project.
