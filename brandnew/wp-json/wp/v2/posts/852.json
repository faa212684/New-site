As with almost every updated release of the Quicktime,\ufffda new icon emerges &mdash; in this case it is also accompanied by the addition of an X at the end of the name, probably acknowledging that it will be some time before the blue Q is completely superseded by the new one. In a way, this iteration of the Q-clock is the one that was always meant to be. Finally the count will reach 20 seconds and the arm will tick its way into formal harmony with the Q descender. I&#8217;m sure many of us have always wondered why this hadn&#8217;t happened at the outset. One can imagine that this current design may have been a predecessor to the first Q release,\ufffda version that perhaps wasn&#8217;t approved for abstracting &#8220;Time&#8221; too much, an approval committee saying &#8220;What if the second hand was separated from the tail of the Q?&#8221; and a designer saying &#8220;D&#8217;oh!&#8221; But let us not dwell on our past experiences,\ufffdthis logomark is finally living up to its potential. While the plastic, gradient-happy rendering complicates an elegant solution,\ufffdfor all of us inclined to do so, we can sit back and imagine the two-dimensional, one-color version and breathe a sigh of relief.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/quicktime_logo_evolution.jpg\" alt=\"Quicktime Logo, New\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>The evolution of the Quicktime logo.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.the2ndday.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Junghoon Park<\/a> for the tip.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":4,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[12,26,88],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/852"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/4"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=852"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/852\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=852"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=852"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=852"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
