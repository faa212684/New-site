Hemsl&ouml;jden operates eight retail stores, 22 regional offices, oversees more than 90 member organizations, and counts with 17,000 members. How awesome is it to have a national organization that supports craft? Recently the whole organization adopted a new identity that was introduced earlier this year designed by Stockholm-based <a href=\"http:\/\/snask.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Snask<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>We changed the associations of Swedish Handicraft from old butter knifes and knitting into everything made by hand, thus creating something modern but with a rich history of knowledge and experience. We made a logotype, that could be made by hand flat on a surface as well as built up by any material, as well as an graphic identity.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/snask.com\/case\/swedish-handicraft-soc\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Snask project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hemslojden_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Hemsl&ouml;jden by Snask\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hemslojden_identity_elements.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Hemsl&ouml;jden by Snask\" \/>\n<figcaption>Identity elements.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The previous logo wasn&#8217;t particularly well crafted. It was competent, what with all those umlauts on the type on a circle, and its color palette was definitely Swedish but there was nothing that spoke to the artisanal nature of handicrafts. While chiseled logos are nothing new, this heavily chiseled &#8220;H&#8221; works great for this organization, looking as if someone has carved it out of stone or wood. (Snask has obviously made a wood version, below, and an even more adorable version made out of different materials, all the way at the bottom). The colors on the &#8220;H&#8221; give it a fun twist, so it&#8217;s not just a monochromatic game of light and shadow. The relatively ornate serif typography provides good contrast to the blocky &#8220;H&#8221; and has a wonderful &#8220;j&#8221; that looks as if it was bent iron. My only complaint would be the choice of black for the wordmark; the brown in the color palette above seems like a better fit.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hemslojden_wood_sculpture.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Hemsl&ouml;jden by Snask\" \/>\n<figcaption>The monogram as a wood sculpture.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hemslojden_collection_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Hemsl&ouml;jden by Snask\" \/>\n<figcaption>Still life of a few identity samples.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hemslojden_tote_bag.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Hemsl&ouml;jden by Snask\" \/>\n<figcaption>Tote bag.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hemslojden_stationary.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Hemsl&ouml;jden by Snask\" \/>\n<figcaption>Various stationery products.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hemslojden_business_cards.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Hemsl&ouml;jden by Snask\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hemslojden_pattern_01_animation.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Hemsl&ouml;jden by Snask\" \/>\n<figcaption>Patterns.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hemslojden_pattern_rolls.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Hemsl&ouml;jden by Snask\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hemslojden_pattern_rolls_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Hemsl&ouml;jden by Snask\" \/>\n<figcaption>Pattern paper rolls.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hemslojden_h_materials_adorable.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Hemsl&ouml;jden by Snask\" \/>\n<figcaption>Totally adorable monogram.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">A pattern of multiple tools in the warm color palette adorns the tote bag and the business cards, while other patterns make up nice wrapping paper rolls. Providing more youthful and playful identity elements than the more serious presence of the chiseled &#8220;H&#8221; and spare layouts and elegant typography that creates a mullet-like effect: business in the front, party in the back. Overall, this is a vibrant and hearty identity that clearly represents what the organization&#8217;s members are about.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1912, Hemsl&ouml;jden (&#8220;Handicraft&#8221; in Swedish) is the National Association of Swedish Handicraft Societies, a non-profit organization devoted to the joy of handicrafts.
