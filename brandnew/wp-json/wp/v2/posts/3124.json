Canal Q focuses on original programming, much of it host-driven, in the realms of humor, entertainment, and information, and describes itself as a channel &#8220;under construction, but particularly in deconstruction&#8221;. Mainstream series and movies complete the programming. Last month, Canal Q introduced a new logo and on-air package designed in collaboration by <a href=\"http:\/\/silvioteixeira.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Silvio Teixeira<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/cargocollective.com\/homembala\/HomemBala\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">HomemBala<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.myfonts.com\/person\/Nuno_Alves\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nuno Alves<\/a> (custom typography), and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.moullinex.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Moullinex<\/a> (music).<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>The logo was made to work as a &#8220;movie set&#8221;, so in application it represents a stage. All the decisions throughout the design process were made with the goal of having a simple and powerful &#8220;real-life&#8221; use of the logo. The stage is an open source tool that can be used by the channel&#8217;s team to further develop the brand&#8217;s identity. The process happened almost in-house with a close relationship with the Channel and a big support from its the technical team.<\/blockquote><h3>Provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/canal_q_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and On-Air Look for Canal Q by Silvio Teixeira, HomemBala, Nuno Alves, and Moullinex\" class=\"imgover\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail with animation of some notes on its construction. Rollover to stop on the notes.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>There is something really ugly about that &#8220;Q&#8221; but I find it irresistibly appealing. There is a blunt, unpolished quality to it that gives it the necessary quirk to represent the programming shown on the channel. Where the previous logo tried to look forward-thinking or edgy or futuristic, this one embraces the more hands-on approach and construction\/deconstruction philosophy of its shows. The &#8220;canal&#8221; typography is simple and clean; obviously not too different from all the Avenir-Futura-Avant Garde typography we see a lot of, but in this particular word it looks nice.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/canal_q_on-air_graphics.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and On-Air Look for Canal Q by Silvio Teixeira, HomemBala, Nuno Alves, and Moullinex\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sample on-air graphics.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/canal_q_on-air_funnies.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and On-Air Look for Canal Q by Silvio Teixeira, HomemBala, Nuno Alves, and Moullinex\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sample idents.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/90667837\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Full set of on-air package. Long video, you have to scrub to skip the show samples (which are fine, just a little long). Some fun behind-the-scenes shots at the very end.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">The real charm and success of this identity is in its on-air use. There are two aspects to it: 1) The actual, information graphics with show times and descriptions and 2) the idents and channel branding, that establish the attitude of Canal Q. The graphics are sharp and quirky with a great color palette and some random shapes thrown in because, random shapes. (It reminds me of Ben Pieratt&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/hessian.tv\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hessian identity<\/a> for sale.) They have an old-school feel with a twenty-tens aesthetic to it. The idents then bring the stage concept to life with a slew of humorous vignettes where the &#8220;Q&#8221; acts as a hole in the wall and things happen behind and in front of it. It&#8217;s hard not to like this and it provides a new, refreshing take on the logo-as-window approach. Overall, this identity seems to fit the channel&#8217;s ethos perfectly.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Launched in 2010, Canal Q is a Portuguese television channel available on two of the larger cable providers in Portugal, MEO and ZON.
