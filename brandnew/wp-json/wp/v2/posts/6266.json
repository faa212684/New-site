The programme depicts the adventures of a Time Lord called &#8220;the Doctor&#8221;, an extraterrestrial being from the planet Gallifrey. The Doctor explores the universe in a time-travelling space ship called the TARDIS. Its exterior appears as a blue British police box, which was a common sight in Britain in 1963 when the series first aired. Accompanied by a number of companions, the Doctor combats a variety of foes, while working to save civilisations and help people in need. Twelve actors have headlined the series as the Doctor. The transition from one actor to another is written into the plot of the show with the concept of regeneration into a new incarnation &#8211; an idea introduced in 1966 to allow the show to continue after the departure of original lead William Hartnell who was becoming very ill at the time. The concept is that this is a Time Lord trait through which the character of the Doctor takes on a new body and personality to recover from a severe injury or anything that would otherwise kill a normal person. Each actor&#8217;s portrayal differs, but all represent stages in the life of the same character and form a single narrative. The time-travelling feature of the plot means that different incarnations of the Doctor occasionally meet. The Doctor is currently portrayed by Jodie Whittaker, who took on the role after Peter Capaldi&#8217;s exit in [2017]&#8221; (<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Doctor_Who\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wikipedia<\/a>)<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/doctor_who_2018_logo_a.png\" alt=\"New Logo for &lt;em&gt;Doctor Who&lt;\/em&gt; by LittleHawk\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/doctor_who_2018_logo_before_after_render_a.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for &lt;em&gt;Doctor Who&lt;\/em&gt; by LittleHawk\" \/>\n<figcaption>Full render versions, before and after.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/doctor_who_2018_logo_a.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for &lt;em&gt;Doctor Who&lt;\/em&gt; by LittleHawk\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/doctor_who_2018_logo_a_portrait.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for &lt;em&gt;Doctor Who&lt;\/em&gt; by LittleHawk\" \/>\n<figcaption>Promo image.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/doctor_who_2018_insignia_a.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for &lt;em&gt;Doctor Who&lt;\/em&gt; by LittleHawk\" \/>\n<figcaption>Shorthand logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/gMGiqAYL1Mw\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo animation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>[Update 2\/28\/18: Post updated with high-resolution images]<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"(Est. 1963) &quot;Doctor Who is a British science-fiction television programme produced by the BBC since 1963.
