Earlier this week at the opening of its new 800,000-square-foot campus, Mediacorp introduced a new identity designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bonseydesign.com\/casestudy_mediacorp.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bonsey Design<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>CEO Shaun Seow said he hoped the logo&#8217;s rich colours and texture, a significant departure from its monochromatic precedent, will help project Mediacorp&#8217;s vibrancy and its multiplicity of talent, media and experiences. In a nod to Mediacorp&#8217;s dual roles of commercial media house and public service broadcaster, Mr Seow added, &#8220;Our new logo&#8217;s rich palette also channels Singapore&#8217;s cultural smorgasbord. Even as we innovate to meet changing needs, we strive to bind our society together, like how the colours in the letter M come together holistically.&#8221;<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mediacorp.sg\/en\/mediacorp-in-the-news\/media-releases\/mediacorp-campus-5947114\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mediacorp press release<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/medicacorp_logo_detail.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Mediacorp by Bonsey Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Da9sb9h4dDE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>&#8220;See Us In A New Light&#8221; TV spot. Logo animation at the end.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure what it is about the old logo but there is something I like about it that would have been interesting to see evolved with the help of a bad-ass type designer or letterer. Nonetheless, it&#8217;s an old-looking logo and with the advent of a mega building there is a need for a mega logo, delivered in the form of a multi-gradient monogram &#8220;M&#8221;. Maybe I&#8217;m getting soft or more forgiving but&hellip; I don&#8217;t hate it and could even possibly say I like it. Of all the gradient applications for logos this feels more on purpose and generates some interesting textures and color clashes that result in a festive-looking logo that still manages to feel overlord-y. The wordmark&hellip; I&#8217;ve never liked this <a href=\"https:\/\/www.myfonts.com\/fonts\/fontfont\/ff-dax\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dax-esque<\/a> structure so this still gets no commendation from my part other than saying it looks corporate. I wish the animation of the logo were more related to the logo somehow and not just the gratuitous colored glass effect that suddenly flashes into the final file.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mediacorp_stationery.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Mediacorp by Bonsey Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stationery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mediacorp_guidelines.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Mediacorp by Bonsey Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Guidelines.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mediacorp_online.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Mediacorp by Bonsey Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Online presence.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mediacorp_steps.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Mediacorp by Bonsey Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Steps at the new corporate campus.

The gradient rays on the stationery are quite lame. I would have loved to see the identity go in the direction of whatever the heck is going on in the steps on the new campus because that is the right kind of cray-cray. Overall, everything seems par for the course for a large media conglomerate.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1963, Mediacorp is the largest media broadcaster and provider in Singapore, running eight TV channels, thirteen radio stations, seven online publications, and twelve printed magazines.
