The name, which means &#8220;nap&#8221; in Spanish, takes center stage in the packaging, designed by Amsterdam, Netherlands-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/LuisUtrillas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Luis Utrillas<\/a>, with a great illustration of a person napping on a hammock that hangs from two sturdy hops and a miracle-like spark that emanates from the bottle of beer at the center of the relatively ludicrous but kick-ass illustration. This is accompanied by fun(ky) typography and illustrations that are a fun(ky) mix of graffiti and, like, tiki? Hard to pinpoint. Anyway, there are a lot of great details throughout the various images shown at the project link, including the 1980s-tastic 3D renders behind the bottles. This brings new meaning to &#8220;siesta time!&#8221; in which you can take a nap after drinking this beer. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/96175777\/Siesta-Brewing-Co-La-Siesta-es-Sagrada\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Agora Vermouth by Backbar Studios<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_agora_a.jpg\" alt=\"Agora Vermouth by Backbar Studios\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/agoravermouth\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Agora Vermouth<\/a> is a small-batch vermouth in &#8220;Bianco&#8221; and &#8220;Rosso&#8221; varieties created by Arthur Voulgaris, an &#8220;enthusiastic drinks industry professional&#8221; (which sounds like an awesome thing to be), made in Suffolk, England. The labels, designed by Dublin, Ireland-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.backbarstudios.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Backbar Studios<\/a>, are, in principle, nothing new, with their Victorian-esque aesthetic but there is no denying these are delightfully done with very nice typographic treatments, delicate shading, and ornate patterns to frame the label. For now, there is a slight disconnect between the real bottles seen in Agora&#8217;s Instagram page and the images above, which I imagine is a matter of budget so, Suffolk folks, get to buying some Agora so that they can upgrade to those bottles and extra long neck labels. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.backbarstudios.com\/agora-vermouth\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Muma by Carosello Lab<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_muma_a.jpg\" alt=\"Muma by Carosello Lab\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mumagin.com\/en\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Muma<\/a> is a gin made in the town of Trinitapoli in  southeast Italy distilled using pure sea water from the Mediterranean Sea &#8212; no idea how that works but it doesn&#8217;t matter when it&#8217;s packaged this good. Designed by Milan, Italy-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.carosellolab.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Carosello Lab<\/a>, the octagonal label &#8212; which references the eight ingredients of the gin (six botanicals, sea water, and a secret ingredient) &#8212; holds a cornucopia of typography and illustrations anchored by a very serif-y wordmark at the center. The mint color looks great against the clear spirit, the sparks of gold foil are, as always, appreciated, and the photography of the bottles against the dark gloomy water is mamma mia.  <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.carosellolab.com\/works\/muma\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"A triple threat of ornate, typographically-driven packaging this week with work from Amsterdam, Dublin, and Milan&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[51,11,26],"tags":[184,1122,1465],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8928"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=8928"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8928\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=8928"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=8928"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=8928"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
