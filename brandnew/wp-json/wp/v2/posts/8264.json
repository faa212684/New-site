They compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the National League (NL) Central division. The team is named for the city&#8217;s association with the brewing industry. Since 2001, the Brewers have played their home games at Miller Park, which has a seating capacity of 41,900. They are the only franchise to play in four divisions since the advent of divisional play in Major League Baseball in 1969. They are also one of two current MLB franchises to switch leagues in their history, the other one being the Houston Astros. The team&#8217;s only World Series appearance came in 1982, and they are one of only six current MLB teams that have never won the World Series.&#8221; (<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Milwaukee_Brewers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wikipedia<\/a>)<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/milwaukee_brewers_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logos and Uniforms for Milwaukee Brewers by Rare\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/milwaukee_brewers_logo_glove_before_after.png\" alt=\"New Logos and Uniforms for Milwaukee Brewers by Rare\" \/>\n<figcaption>Comparison between 1978 &#8211; 1993 glove logo and the new one.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/milwaukee_brewers_logo_glove.png\" alt=\"New Logos and Uniforms for Milwaukee Brewers by Rare\" \/>\n<figcaption>Glove logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/milwaukee_brewers_logo_barrelman_before_after.png\" alt=\"New Logos and Uniforms for Milwaukee Brewers by Rare\" \/>\n<figcaption>&#8220;Barrelman&#8221; logo, before and after.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/milwaukee_brewers_logo_secondary.png\" alt=\"New Logos and Uniforms for Milwaukee Brewers by Rare\" \/>\n<figcaption>Secondary marks.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/milwaukee_brewers_typography.png\" alt=\"New Logos and Uniforms for Milwaukee Brewers by Rare\" \/>\n<figcaption>Custom typeface.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/milwaukee_brewers_uniforms_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logos and Uniforms for Milwaukee Brewers by Rare\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/milwaukee_brewers_uniforms_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logos and Uniforms for Milwaukee Brewers by Rare\" \/>\n<figcaption>Uniforms.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/milwaukee_brewers_uniforms_details_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logos and Uniforms for Milwaukee Brewers by Rare\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/milwaukee_brewers_uniforms_details_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logos and Uniforms for Milwaukee Brewers by Rare\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/milwaukee_brewers_uniforms_details_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logos and Uniforms for Milwaukee Brewers by Rare\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/milwaukee_brewers_uniforms_details_04.jpg\" alt=\"New Logos and Uniforms for Milwaukee Brewers by Rare\" \/>\n<figcaption>Uniform details.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/UnaII3HPFAo\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>New look introduction video.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"(Est. 1969) &quot;The Milwaukee Brewers are an American professional baseball team based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
