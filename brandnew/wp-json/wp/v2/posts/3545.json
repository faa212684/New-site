It focuses on multiple things like increasing the number of startups in the city, establishing Oslo as one of the most innovative cities in Europe, and monitoring and analyzing other cities to keep Oslo on track. Recently, they introduced a new logo designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/metricdesign.no\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Metric<\/a>.<\/p> <!--more--><blockquote>We aimed to make a timeless and iconic logotype for Oslo that was both positive and energetic.

I mean&hellip; isn&#8217;t it! Changing an &#8220;i&#8221; or an &#8220;l&#8221; to an exclamation point isn&#8217;t the most novel of ideas but typically this approach is set in bubbly typefaces or accompanied by starbursts or the exclamation point set at a fun angle. What makes this interesting is the contrast with both the spare sans serif &mdash; Lineto&#8217;s Circular, of course &mdash; and the buttoned-up name of Oslo Business Region. It&#8217;s almost like a mullet: business on the front, party in the back.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/oslo_business_region_pattern.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Oslo Business Region by Metric\" \/>\n<figcaption>Pattern.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/oslo_business_region_elements.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Oslo Business Region by Metric\" \/>\n<figcaption>Identity elements.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/oslo_business_region_ads.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Oslo Business Region by Metric\" \/>\n<figcaption>Ads.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">In the canon of business and destination logos like I [Heart] NY or I amsterdam it may not be the most outstanding example&hellip; yet. I think its simplicity may carry over for a number of years and will depend on how much use it gets from the city. Right now it feels small and contained whereas, for example again, the I amsterdam campaign was fairly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=iamsterdam&#038;espv=2&#038;biw=1661&#038;bih=866&#038;source=lnms&#038;tbm=isch&#038;sa=X&#038;ei=GjxGVOGSN-i-8QHGpIC4Cg&#038;ved=0CAYQ_AUoAQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">visible<\/a>.
