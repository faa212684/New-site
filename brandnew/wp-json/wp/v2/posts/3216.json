Through various acquisitions, WorldPay today is one of the leading payment processing companies in the world, managing over 26 million transactions every day. From small and medium-sized businesses to large corporations, WorldPay helps set them up with everything from physical payment terminals to integrated cash register systems to complex e-commerce structures. Earlier this month, the company <a href=\"http:\/\/www.worldpay.us\/blog\/worldpay-us-launches-new-brand-worldwide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">introduced<\/a> a new identity designed by London-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.someoneinlondon.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SomeOne<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>Because Worldpay operate on such a large scale it was important from the beginning to develop a core idea which would tell their whole story through their branding. Yes they process transactions and provide payment solutions, but what they really do is connect people. They enable buyers and sellers to interact with one another from anywhere in the world, seamlessly and with ease.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.someoneinlondon.com\/category\/projects\/re-branding-26-million-daily-payments\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SomeOne project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/worldpay_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for WorldPay by SomeOne\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>We have developed a world based on the idea of fluid connections which takes different forms depending on where you come into contact with Worldpay. From a bold light based brand property which echoes the trails of digital payments, right down to creating an entire suite of iconography that carries the same depth as the rest of the brand. Everything has been designed to be recognisable as Worldpay even when you can&#8217;t see a logo.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.someoneinlondon.com\/category\/projects\/re-branding-26-million-daily-payments\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SomeOne project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/worldpay_loxodrome_explanation.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for WorldPay by SomeOne\" \/>\n<figcaption>The loxodrome and its relationship to Worldpay, explained. &#8220;Inspired by the data trails made by money as they travel around the planet seamlessly.&#8221;<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>In navigation, a rhumb line (or loxodrome) is a line crossing all meridians of longitude at the same angle, i.e. a path derived from a defined initial bearing. That is, upon taking an initial bearing, one proceeds along the same bearing, without changing the direction as measured relative to true or magnetic north.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rhumb_line\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wikipedia<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/worldpay_loxodrome_construction.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for WorldPay by SomeOne\" \/>\n<figcaption>Loxodrome construction.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/worldpay_loxodrome_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for WorldPay by SomeOne\" \/>\n<figcaption>Loxodrome detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/95350231?portrait=0&amp;color=f0001c\" width=\"500\" height=\"352\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Some 3D views.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/worldpay_loxodrome_spinning.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for WorldPay by SomeOne\" \/>\n<figcaption>Animated GIF of a 3D-printed loxodrome, spinning, in real life..<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/worldpay_loxodrome_symbol.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for WorldPay by SomeOne\" \/>\n<figcaption>Loxodrome as icon, detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The first thought is most likely, &#8220;Oh, dear god, not another globe or marble thing, please.&#8221; Which would be an appropriate reaction but it would also be missing the point. Sure, there are dozens of globe-y things out there that are all meant to convey some sort of global-connected-ness concept, but this one <em>actually<\/em> does and it has a good motive to be the way it is and because, loxodrome. The resulting icon is beautifully constructed in all literal ways: as a 3D graphic, as a flat icon, and as a 3D-printed object. It&#8217;s a very engaging, multi-dimensional shape that looks corporate and appropriate for a money company yet still has enough intrigue to it to take it, I believe, beyond the AT&amp;T, BT, Sony Ericcson, et al marbles. The slab typography works fine with the loxodrome, perhaps a tad too big and disproportionate in relationship to the icon as a lock-up. And they are not fooling anyone with the all-lowercase approach: we know they are a huge company trying to look friendly.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/worldpay_type_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for WorldPay by SomeOne\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/worldpay_type_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for WorldPay by SomeOne\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/worldpay_type_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for WorldPay by SomeOne\" \/>\n<figcaption>Custom alphabet.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/worldpay_type_04_signage.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for WorldPay by SomeOne\" \/>\n<figcaption>Alphabet in use.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Another big part of the identity is a custom alphabet built with multiple lines emanating from a joint point in the character.
