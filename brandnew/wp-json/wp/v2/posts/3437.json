It is now sold by Hasbro, under the Nerf brand &mdash; which is another fascinating product and story altogether. The Super Soaker is an amazingly popular toy &mdash; fans include <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=l_C74hN9nAU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Michael Jackson<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.buzzfeed.com\/lyapalater\/leonardo-dicaprios-intense-watergun-fight-is-actually-why-wa#9d24xd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Leonard DiCaprio<\/a> &mdash; and its multi-patented engineering makes for amazingly complex and fast-shooting water guns. Earlier this year, the Super Soaker introduced a new logo and packaging designed by San Diego, CA-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.soupgroup.com\/entertainment\/portfolio\/all\/nerf-super-soaker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Soup Group<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/super_soaker_old_samples.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Super Soaker by Soup Group\" \/>\n<figcaption>Samples of the previous packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/super_soaker_logo_detail.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Super Soaker by Soup Group\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>When judging design for mainstream American toys you have to get into a whole other mindset and points of reference; specifically when it comes to what look like alien weaponry you have to think like a 10-yeard-old boy who vehemently believes girls have cooties. The previous logo was fine; a little stumpy and awkward around some parts and perhaps a bit flat. The new logo takes the basic shapes of the original letterforms and turns on the warp speed to put the type on a curve with some fancy inner shading and better dimensionality along with a thick, unapologetic swoosh. This may not be what we all think of high-class design but it&#8217;s damn effective and appropriate.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/super_soaker_name_illustrations.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Super Soaker by Soup Group\" \/>\n<figcaption>Various Super Soaker names.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>For me, the above is the coolest part of this project: the rendering of the names of the different guns. Not only are the names out of control ridiculous (yet awesome) but they are now rendered in gushing splashes of water and in an almost Art Deco typeface that make the whole presentation a little mind-blowing (as in &#8220;who comes up with this shit?&#8221;).<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/super_soaker_wave.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Super Soaker by Soup Group\" \/>\n<figcaption>Wave illustration.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/super_soaker_new_packaging_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Super Soaker by Soup Group\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/super_soaker_new_packaging_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Super Soaker by Soup Group\" \/>\n<figcaption>New packaging, sexy shots.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/super_soaker_new_packaging_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Super Soaker by Soup Group\" \/>\n<figcaption>New packaging, less sexy shots.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/QVg2t7LA1dE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>TV ad.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">The new packaging brings all the elements together quite nicely, with the exception of the requisite photos of children playing with the toy &mdash; they kind of break the mood, especially compared to some of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.soupgroup.com\/entertainment\/portfolio\/all\/nerf-super-soaker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the illustrations Soup Group did<\/a> that would have looked neat on the boxes.
