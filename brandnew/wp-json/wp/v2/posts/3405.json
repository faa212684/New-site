Its main product is a pilsner and it also produces seven other &mdash; Heavy Blonde, Double Bock, Lentebock, Up, Imperator, Sylvester, and Weizen.

Most refreshingly, the logo has been taken out of its constricting oval and given room to breathe. The shield, although now with more elements and complex, feels cleaner than before and the typography overall has been vastly improved. The only fault is the drawing of the barley-hops-thing, it&#8217;s like they ran out of energy on it as it looks nothing like any of the other elements.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/brand_bier_pilsener_old.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Brand Bier by VBAT\" \/>\n<figcaption>A sample of the old look of their flagship pilsner beer.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/brand_bier_pilsener_old_more.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Brand Bier by VBAT\" \/>\n<figcaption>Old look of other Brand beers.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/brand_bier_bottles_all.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Brand Bier by VBAT\" \/>\n<figcaption>New bottles.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The previous look wasn&#8217;t offensive in any kind of way but it wasn&#8217;t memorable either. The heavy oval with the brewery name or beer kind on it was a bit oppressive and the consistency in type application left a lot to be desired for. The new bottles, on the other hand, are quite amazing. The mostly-label-less bottle has been embossed with a large version of the logo that wraps around the full front and provides (I&#8217;m imagining) a great tactile experience with the product. The only distinction now between the beers is the neck label and color-coded caps. It might be a little more difficult to distinguish quickly but it&#8217;s a really elegant and cool approach.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/brand_bier_bottles_and_boxes_all.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Brand Bier by VBAT\" \/>\n<figcaption>Bottles and 6-packs.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Each beer kind now has its own logo derived from the main logo, with a more consistent (and heavily ornamental) typographic approach that give the 6-packs a commanding shelf presence.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/brand_bier_pilsener_new_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Brand Bier by VBAT\" \/>\n<figcaption>Pilsner logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"http:\/\/streaming.anp.nl\/players\/kQeDhMAx-z3ZDmuZJ.html\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"auto\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Introducing the new look for the pilsner.
