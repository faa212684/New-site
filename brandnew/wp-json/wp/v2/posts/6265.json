Originally published as a broadsheet newspaper, AdAge still has a strong print presence, pumping out 24 issues a year of the eponymous magazine to more than 60,000 subscribers as well as now having a major online presence with 2.4 million unique visitors a year to its online content and over 3,000 attendees to its numerous events across the year. A part of Crain Communications, AdAge also manages Creativity (magazine and online publication) and DataCenter, a cache of industry data. Last September, AdAge introduced a new identity designed by New York, NY-based <a href=\"http:\/\/originalchampionsofdesign.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">OCD<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>The move from Advertising Age to Ad Age was a no brainer. It was past time for the masthead to align with the vernacular. The lettering was crafted by <a href=\"https:\/\/frerejones.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tobias Frere-Jones<\/a>. It is based on the original 1930s masthead.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/originalchampionsofdesign.com\/a-new-ad-age-for-a-new-advertising-age\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">OCD project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/adage_1930s_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for AdAge by OCD\" \/>\n<figcaption>1930s logo that the new logo is based on.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/adage_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for AdAge by OCD\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/adage_logo_construction.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for AdAge by OCD\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo details.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/adage_logo_alignments_02.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for AdAge by OCD\" \/>\n<figcaption>Vertical alignment variation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/adage_logo_alignments_03.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for AdAge by OCD\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stacked variation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo wasn&#8217;t bad but it wasn&#8217;t good either. To me it always looked like an old-school, old-fashioned, Mad-Men-era-holding representation of the advertising industry. Neither the logo nor the magazine ever felt fresh or contemporary even if the content was. The new logo, despite being based on a nearly 90-year-old logo, feels infinitely more energetic, engaging, and contemporary. Drawn by <a href=\"https:\/\/frerejones.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tobias Frere-Jones<\/a> the logo is a wonderful modern interpretation of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.myfonts.com\/fonts\/linotype\/kabel\/?refby=ucllc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kabel<\/a> and while it still operates within the minimalist sans serif trend, the &#8220;g&#8221; gives it a unique and memorable twist and the way that &#8220;g&#8221; is sort of pinching the &#8220;A&#8221; is extra delicious.<\/p>\n<p>The logo has a nice flexibility to be stacked or rotated vertically as well as being paired with the myriad events\/initiatives\/sister-products that AdAge produces and adapting to being in a primary or secondary role.<\/p>\n<blockquote>Ad Age brand architecture was reorganized into a three-tiered system that prioritized the content that is most important to readers: Creativity and Datacenter. Tier 2 is primarily events and awards. And Tier 3 is everything else. Tier 3 uses a type-only treatment of initiatives to reduce logo clutter.<br \/><br \/>Each Tier 2 event is supported by a custom banding system. The first to roll out was Ad Age Next with a warm palette and consistent band height.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/originalchampionsofdesign.com\/a-new-ad-age-for-a-new-advertising-age\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">OCD project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/adage_logo_subbrands_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for AdAge by OCD\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/adage_logo_subbrands_01a.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for AdAge by OCD\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sub-brands.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>Advertising moves fast. The news moves faster. Ad Age needed a rinse-and-repeat system that looked fresh everytime. The typographic tool kit leans into Ad Age&#8217;s newspaper heritage; three typefaces and a commitment to easy-reading columns on all platforms.<br \/><br \/>The bands of color further supported efficiency. When you need a design element, you have all of the stripes. When you need the design to get out of the way, you have fewer stripes. The seventeen-color palette brings variability.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/originalchampionsofdesign.com\/a-new-ad-age-for-a-new-advertising-age\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">OCD project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/adage_type_and_colors.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for AdAge by OCD\" \/>\n<figcaption>Type and colors.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/adage_cheatsheet.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for AdAge by OCD\" \/>\n<figcaption>One-page guideline cheat sheet.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/adage_business_cards.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for AdAge by OCD\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/adage_business_cards_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for AdAge by OCD\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/adage_banners.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for AdAge by OCD\" \/>\n<figcaption>Banners.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The identity is based on a system of colorful and bold stripes with the logo sitting prominently on the top or the side along with a solid use of clear and bold typography, giving it flexibility to adapt to banners, newsletters, social media posts, and more. <\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/adage_tote.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for AdAge by OCD\" \/>\n<figcaption>Tote.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/adage_pillow_cup.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for AdAge by OCD\" \/>\n<figcaption>Pillows and mug.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Oddly, I really want one of those pillows.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/adage_covers_old.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for AdAge by OCD\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sampling of old covers.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/adage_covers.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for AdAge by OCD\" \/>\n<figcaption>New covers.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/adage_interiors.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for AdAge by OCD\" \/>\n<figcaption>Interiors.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">The magazine is a major improvement with the covers having a really bold presence and now that the logo isn&#8217;t 5 miles long, &#8220;AdAge&#8221; sits big and proud at the top. The story callouts on the cover are nicely handled inside the color bars and the serif, <a href=\"https:\/\/frerejones.com\/families\/exchange\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Exchange<\/a>, adds a great touch of classiness. Overall, this is a very positive evolution that breathes new life into what looked like a really tired, out of touch brand.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1930 (originally as Advertising Age), AdAge is a global media platform focused on &quot;curated creativity, data and analysis, people and culture, and innovation and forecasting&quot;.
