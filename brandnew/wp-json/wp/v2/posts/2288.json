Nivea&#8217;s most well-known product is its original Nivea Cr&egrave;me which was first packaged in the iconic blue tin in 1925 and now serves as the basis for the &#8220;new global design language&#8221; introduced by Nivea this week, designed by San Francisco-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fuseproject.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fuseproject<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nivea_existing.jpg\" alt=\"Nivea Logo and Packaging\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Sample of existing products and their packaging.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nivea_tin_to_bottle.jpg\" alt=\"Nivea Logo and Packaging\" \/><\/p>\n<blockquote>The blue tin has embodied NIVEA&#8217;s brand values since 1925. It is the brand &#8220;face&#8221; that consumers around the world associate with trust, closeness and expertise. Now Beiersdorf AG has introduced a new global design language based on the iconic blue tin. The new design consistently translates the successful NIVEA brand&#8217;s values into a product that consumers can see and feel, thereby making products in all categories immediately recognizable. Beiersdorf has consistently developed the NIVEA brand with a focus on its global core values. The gradual introduction of the new design for the entire NIVEA skin and body care portfolio will commence in more than 200 countries in January 2013.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.beiersdorf.com\/Press\/Press_Releases_News\/NIVEA_Gets_A_New_Global_Design.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press Release<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nivea_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"Nivea Logo and Packaging\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Although a circle version of the logo has been used before, and is currently what&#8217;s on the Nivea website, it is not officially the sole logo: Try a Google Image Search for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?hl=en&#038;q=nivea+logo&#038;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.&#038;bvm=bv.41018144,d.b2I&#038;biw=1443&#038;bih=833&#038;um=1&#038;ie=UTF-8&#038;tbm=isch&#038;source=og&#038;sa=N&#038;tab=wi&#038;ei=_5f2UIp0ibLxBMn1gLgF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nivea logo<\/a> and wince in pain. On its current range of products the Nivea wordmark is delivered in a rectangle with an unflattering curve with cheap gradients hanging from the bottom. The idea of establishing a single logo is not just good but much needed. Basing it on the iconic tin can is the perfect rallying cry for the company to adopt it and stick with it. It&#8217;s unfortunate that the kerning wasn&#8217;t fixed, you can put a whole body lotion bottle between the &#8220;NI&#8221; pair. It&#8217;s a tricky word to kern, but surely it can be done.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nivea_concept_sketches.jpg\" alt=\"Nivea Logo and Packaging\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Sketches and prototypes.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nivea_packaging_01.jpg\" alt=\"Nivea Logo and Packaging\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Sample of new packaging.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nivea_packaging_tilted_cap_detail.jpg\" alt=\"Nivea Logo and Packaging\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Detail of tilted and logo-embossed cap.<\/p>\n<blockquote>The blue NIVEA tin wasn&#8217;t just the basis of the design, but also a source of inspiration to the designers. The cr&egrave;me tin is used as a logo, reflected in the rounded contours of the new packagings and in the reduced blue and white colors of the new design. The round lid, which tilts towards the consumer, embossed with the NIVEA logo, has obvious similarities with the iconic blue tin and it provides customers with a &#8220;familiar face&#8221; on the shelf.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.beiersdorf.com\/Press\/Press_Releases_News\/NIVEA_Gets_A_New_Global_Design.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press Release<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p>The new packaging looks great. The bottles look softer and friendlier and the tilted cap is a fun example of user friendliness in the real (physical) world. It does look like they are keeping the creme\/droplet motif from the old packaging but rendered in a new way. It&#8217;s totally goofy but most mainstream packaging is, so it fits well. Overall, I love me a good standardization and simplification exercise that builds on existing equity at a global scale.<\/p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/57365769?portrait=0&amp;color=84eaea\" width=\"574\" height=\"323\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Yves B&eacute;har on the development of the new packaging.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Project spotted at <a href=\"http:\/\/brandingsource.blogspot.com\/2013\/01\/new-look-nivea.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Branding Source<\/a> and most images sourced from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.designboom.com\/design\/fuseproject-yves-behar-nivea-rebranding\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Design Boom<\/a>.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_130116_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_130116_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_130116_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_130116_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,51,26],"tags":[292,128,826,53],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2288"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2288"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2288\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2288"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2288"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2288"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
