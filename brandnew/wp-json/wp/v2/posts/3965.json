Owned by Viacom Media Networks (who also own MTV, Comedy Central, Spike, and others) Logo&#8217;s content has evolved from mostly movie and show reruns and other syndicated content to now including a significant range of original content like <em>RuPaul&#8217;s Drag Race<\/em>, <em>Cucumber<\/em>, and <em>Banana<\/em>. In their words, they &#8220;[Celebrate] one-of-a-kind personalities, unconventional stories and discovering what&#8217;s next&mdash;all through a mix of original and acquired entertainment that&#8217;s outrageous, smart, and inclusive.&#8221; Earlier this year, Logo introduced a new identity and on-air package designed by New York, NY-based <a href=\"http:\/\/gretelny.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gretel<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>We chose the name &#8220;Logo TV&#8221; because a logo is an identity and nothing&#8217;s more important than having your own, unique identity, and making it work for you. Your logo is your symbol, it&#8217;s what you put forward with pride, it&#8217;s who you are, and it&#8217;s what we are.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/gretelny.com\/project\/52\/logo-branding\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Logo FAQs<\/a><\/h3>\n<p>Until today I had never been curious enough as to why they named the channel Logo and I would have bet plenty of money that it was a more direct reference to the LGBT community instead of being named after an element of identity design. It&#8217;s an interesting choice and I like the concept behind it but it makes for THE worst search engine name. Try searching its logo on Google Images, &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=logo+logo&#038;es_sm=91&#038;source=lnms&#038;tbm=isch&#038;sa=X&#038;ei=ntZRVc-4C9CYyAS-7oHQBw&#038;ved=0CAcQ_AUoAQ&#038;biw=1602&#038;bih=866\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Logo logo<\/a>&#8220;. Disaster.<\/p>\n<blockquote>The new design takes cues from mid-century modern design. It&#8217;s simple, sophisticated and clean. There&#8217;s still plenty of room for wit, humor and light-hearted fare, but the package feels elevated and puts the talent front and center.<br \/><br \/>Logo needed a light, nimble, flexible toolkit. Building our entire graphic recipe around just a few key ingredients allowed the Logo team to roll the package out quickly and easily. Subtle variations in the palette, type, imagery and pattern yield a diverse but unified brand.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/gretelny.com\/project\/52\/logo-branding\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gretel project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/logo_tv_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and On-air Look for Logo by Gretel\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The brushed logotype is a signature. It lends a personal touch to the brand and complements the spare, mid-century inspired look of the package. The dot is always an accent, a pop of color.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/gretelny.com\/project\/52\/logo-branding\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gretel project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/logo_tv_logo_animation.gif\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and On-air Look for Logo by Gretel\" \/>\n<figcaption>Close-up of logo animation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>This is the third iteration of the Logo logo with <a href=\"http:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/File:Logo-Logo.svg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the original version<\/a> being one of the uglier TV channel logos I can think of. The second (now previous) version was a vast improvement but mostly because it wasn&#8217;t the original logo anymore. It was a decent wordmark with an interesting typographic choice but it felt pretty dry for a channel whose most popular show is helmed by 6-foot-4-inch drag queen RuPaul. The new logo is much more expressive if still not a great TV logo. The exaggerated letterforms create some strange counter shapes like that tote-bag sized space inside the &#8220;g&#8221; or all the air up there between the top of the &#8220;L&#8221; and the the rest of the letters. As a piece of lettering it&#8217;s not the most pleasant but I appreciate its energy and intention while being put to very good use in the on-air graphics.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/logo_tv_glyph_textures.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and On-air Look for Logo by Gretel\" \/>\n<figcaption>Glyph-based textures.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/logo_tv_typography.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and On-air Look for Logo by Gretel\" \/>\n<figcaption>Typography.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/logo_tv_color_palette.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and On-air Look for Logo by Gretel\" \/>\n<figcaption>Color palettes.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/logo_tv_elements_together.gif\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and On-air Look for Logo by Gretel\" \/>\n<figcaption>The elements coming together.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/127270196?color=f04923&#038;title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>On-air montage.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">As Gretel explains, &#8220;The reign of Queens and the celebration of all things camp has reached its saturation point&#8221; and so the identity goes in, perhaps, an unexpected direction. The on-air graphics rely on a cool set of patterns made from punctuation marks that would make killer pillows or sports jacket lining, particularly in the groovy color palettes specified. The use of House Industries&#8217; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.houseind.com\/fonts\/eames\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Eames Century Modern<\/a> reminds me of Comedy Central&#8217;s heavy use of a serif in their redesign, so there was a little deja vu there. The logo works in this context as it stands out from the rest of the elements but used in an almost secondary role it doesn&#8217;t jar as much as I would have expected. Overall, this is a fun, sophisticated, stylish overhaul that doesn&#8217;t rely on LGBT clich&eacute;s.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Launched in 2005, Logo is an American television channel with programming focused on the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community.
