The European Tour was established by the British-based Professional Golfers&#8217; Association, and responsibility was transferred to an independent PGA European Tour organisation in 1984.[1] Most events on the PGA European Tour&#8217;s three tours are held in Europe, but in recent years an increasing number have been held in other parts of the world outside Europe; in 2015 a majority of the ranking events on the European Tour were held outside Europe, though this included both Majors and World Golf Championship events that are ranking events for multiple tours.&#8221; (<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/PGA_European_Tour\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wikipedia<\/a>)<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/european_tour_golf_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo for European Tour\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/european_tour_golf_logo_inverse.png\" alt=\"New Logo for European Tour\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo, inverse.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/european_tour_golf_logo_subbrands.png\" alt=\"New Logo for European Tour\" \/>\n<figcaption>Related logos.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The European Tour is changing&#8230;<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/DrivingGolfFurther?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#DrivingGolfFurther<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/Ry5FjL2qLc\">pic.twitter.com\/Ry5FjL2qLc<\/a><\/p>&mdash; The European Tour (@EuropeanTour) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/EuropeanTour\/status\/1178957748291166208?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 1, 2019<\/a><\/blockquote> <script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>\n<figcaption>Logo introduction.
