And by fresh I mean it involves beer and a place to eat some pub grub along with it or, as founder Steven Yarak, says &#8220;Why shouldn&#8217;t you own the pub you drink at?!&#8221;. Black Star&#8217;s member-owners also have a say in what the beers taste like, participating in tastings with Black Star&#8217;s own brewer, Jeff Young, who will be creating beers under three categories: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.blackstar.coop\/drink\/house-beers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rational, Irrational, and Infinite<\/a>. In preparation for their opening, Black Star has a new identity designed by Austin-based <a href=\"http:\/\/ptarmak.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ptarmak<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>Black Star was looking for a logo that would express the power of a local cooperative. It had to convey a sense of authority without appearing too socialistic. The model of a co-op demonstrates the true meaning of the democratic process and Black Star wanted to exemplify this in an Austin TX kind of way. So it needed to be fresh and non-stodgy amongst the wealth of traditional visuals associated with beer culture. It needed to be fun and laid back in a serious way.\n<br \/>&mdash; From Ptarmak<\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/black_star_co-op_card.jpg\" alt=\"Black Star Co-Op Pub and Brewery\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/black_star_co-op_matches.jpg\" alt=\"Black Star Co-Op Pub and Brewery\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The original logo looked like what you would expect a co-op logo to look like, kind of dopey and home-brewed (pun intended). So it&#8217;s nice to see a bold and, dare I say, professional identity forged around a co-op concept. The new logo is cool, edgy and bold while actually managing to convey a few different meanings: A little bit of that socialist feel as mentioned above, a little amber hue and the ever popular barley to go with beer, and a slightly hypnotic line pattern for a dose of Austin weird.<\/p>\n<p>And so we end the week with a close-up of beer.
