The identity, designed by Porto, Portugal-based <a href=\"http:\/\/thisispacifica.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">This is Pacifica<\/a>, centers on a cool, modern abstraction of a salmon hanging to smoke combined with a wild, hard-edged wordmark that make for an unexpectedly fun combination. The logo spans the length of the packaging with the lines inside cut out to see the product and an orange ribbon completing the loop of the logo. The use of materials, from the corrugated board to the tissue paper to the orange and white ribbon on the tag reflect the quality of craft that goes into each piece of salmon. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/65353261\/Hardy-Smoked-Masterpiece\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Enter Arkitektur by Lundgren+Lindqvist<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_EnterArkitektur.jpg\" alt=\"Enter Arkitektur by Lundgren+Lindqvist\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/enterarkitektur.se\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Enter Arkitektur<\/a> is an architecture firm in Gothenburg and J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping, Sweden, with some nice work in medium-sized buildings for commercial and residential use. Their new identity, designed by Gothenburg-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lundgrenlindqvist.se\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lundgren+Lindqvist<\/a>, features a great, minimal logo that takes the &#8220;E&#8221; from the name, flips it on its side, places an arrowhead on top, and &#8212; voil\u00e0 &#8212; reveals a house in its negative space. No, they don&#8217;t do cute houses like the one the logo reveals but the logo does convey a sense of smart thinking and clever use of space and, while this could have been cute overload with that little house, the gray color palette gives it the gravitas needed to be taken dead serious. The logo works great on its own or as a repeating pattern that totally messes with your head about whether you are paying attention to the positive or negative space. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.lundgrenlindqvist.se\/projects\/enter-arkitektur\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Clayton Vance Architecture by Kevin Cantrell<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_claytonvance.jpg\" alt=\"Clayton Vance Architecture by Kevin Cantrell\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.claytonvance.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Clayton Vance Architecture<\/a> is also an architecture firm in but in Heber City, UT, and with a very different style than Enter above. Designed by Salt Lake City, UT-based <a href=\"http:\/\/kevincantrell.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kevin Cantrell<\/a>, the identity makes no subtle reference to Roman mosaic tiles and pools and goes full-in on the style and concept, rendering all of the identity elements as if they were embedded in the abode of a Roman emperor who was really into Art Nouveau typography as most Roman emperors were at the time because, you know, time travel.  This isn&#8217;t exactly my style but the commitment to the aesthetic is quite insane and impressive. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/kevincantrell.com\/portfolio\/clayton-vance-architecture\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"We start with some minimalist work and work up to some rather exuberant executions with work from Porto, Gothenburg, and Salt Lake City&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[58,69,11,26],"tags":[953,1002,130,1097],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6526"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=6526"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6526\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=6526"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=6526"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=6526"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
