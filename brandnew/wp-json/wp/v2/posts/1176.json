We&#8217;ll lead the shouting.&#8221; Creative Scotland replaces two institutions that previously represented the arts, Scottish Screen and the Scottish Arts Council. (The latter might sound familiar to some as it was, supposedly, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/speakup\/archives\/002412.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the logo that Quark ripped off back in 2005<\/a>). The identity was designed by Edinburgh-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.leith.co.uk\/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Leith<\/a> who were paid between &pound;25,000 and &pound;35,000 depending on the source and because the money came from public funds, the public is entitled to their opinion. <a href=\"http:\/\/news.scotsman.com\/scotland\/Critics-hit-out-at-39wretched39.6475702.jp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nuggets of criticism<\/a> include &#8220;rubbish,&#8221; &#8220;wretched,&#8221; and &#8220;ugly.&#8221;<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>With the logo, we intend to shine a spotlight on creativity in Scotland and we encourage our arts, screen and creative industries to show off their work using the logo.<br \/><br \/>At the heart of our identity is the idea of &#8216;people, place and ideas&#8217; and we wanted a way of writing the name that would embody this, &#8216;Creative Scot&#8217; and &#8216;Creative land&#8217; &mdash; something that was inventive and surprising. That&#8217;s why the words are split. Also, by placing the words where we have, a subtle &#8216;C&#8217; and &#8216;S&#8217; abbreviation for the organization is formed. Some people will notice it straight away others may not.<br \/><br \/>The geometric shapes of the circle and square represent the building blocks of visual form, they are familiar, but placed in this context become contemporary symbols working in partnership.

The logo is not good. The problem, unfortunately, lies in its execution. The visual concept, of forming the &#8220;C&#8221; and &#8220;S&#8221; from a circle and square, is actually fairly clever but the way it&#8217;s done is not convincing at all. A few more rounds of refinement and exploration would have arrived at a better solution. The typography should have been a little bolder to amplify that white space inside the shapes, and the shapes themselves are too far apart to be read as an acronym, they just feel like separate things that happen to be next to each other, rather being integrated. They have also pulled the ol&#8217; Put Images in the Logo trick, which is always tempting and in this case they have the shapes for it but it just doesn&#8217;t add up to anything exciting or innovative. So I wouldn&#8217;t go as far as calling it wretched or rubbish, but I also wouldn&#8217;t categorize as creative.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to Jason McDowell for the tip.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"red\">Update:<\/span> New images and description in from design firm Leith.
