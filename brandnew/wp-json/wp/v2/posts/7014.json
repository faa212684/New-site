The packaging, designed by Manila-based <a href=\"http:\/\/and-a-half.ph\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">And A Half<\/a>, is rich and ornate from top to bottom, starting with the illustrated letters that make up the name, where each detailed illustration depicts a step of the gin-making process. Only the &#8220;ARC&#8221; made it unto the bottle but the full set is beautiful and it&#8217;s also amazing how well they work in a single color. The labels are unapologetically dense and they give the gin an exotic look that make it clear this isn&#8217;t your typical spirit.  <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/and-a-half.ph\/projects\/archipelago\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Manuka Emporium by Onfire<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_manuka_emporium.jpg\" alt=\"Manuka Emporium by Onfire\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.manukaemporium.co.nz\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Manuka Emporium<\/a> is a seasonal, small batch producer of honey in the remote Manuka bush areas in Northland New Zealand. The packaging, designed by Auckland, New Zealand-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.weareonfire.co.nz\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Onfire<\/a>, takes cues from premium liquor brands to create a Victorian aesthetic for these small but mighty jars. The titular type treatment is pretty nice and the combination of multiple other fonts in the label add up to a contemporary spin on the Victorian aesthetic. The groovy bee icon on the lids literally seals the deal. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.weareonfire.co.nz\/graphic-design-auckland\/manuka-emporium-packaging-branding-design\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Thornbridge Brewery by Thirst<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_thornbridge.jpg\" alt=\"Thornbridge Brewery by Thirst\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thornbridgebrewery.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Thornbridge Brewery<\/a> gets its name from, one, being a brewery and, two, from having started on the grounds of Thornbridge Hall, a large English country house with <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Thornbridge_Hall\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">its own Wikipedia entry<\/a>. Established in 2005, Thornbridge Brewery has grown into a significant craft brewer distributing bottled, canned, and keg&#8217;d beers as well as operating nine pubs. Their new packaging, designed by Glasgow, UK-based <a href=\"https:\/\/thirstcraft.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Thirst<\/a>, revolves around a simplified design of a decorative detail found on the fireplace&#8217;s mantelpiece of Thornbridge Hall. Neatly abstracted into a thin-line drawing, the design is complemented with a lovely condensed flared serif font and delivered in a range of sumptuous colors. The way the names of the beers stand out in white from the colorful backgrounds is a great way to get attention as the brewery gets into the can game for the first time. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/thirstcraft.com\/work\/thornbridge\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"A range of rich, ornate, non-minimalist packaging projects this week, with work from Manila, Auckland, and Glasgow&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[51,11,26],"tags":[184,916,1465],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7014"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=7014"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7014\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=7014"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=7014"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=7014"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
