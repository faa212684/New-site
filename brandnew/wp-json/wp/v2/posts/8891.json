Kids who don&#8217;t have access to play miss out on childhood and are denied critical opportunities to build physical, social and emotional health. For more than two decades, we&#8217;ve teamed up with bold, inspiring partners and community members, starting with the kids themselves, to understand each neighborhood&#8217;s unique aspirations. Then we build incredible places to play, inspired by their design, courage and leadership. Over the last 23 years, we&#8217;ve built or improved 17,000+ playspaces, engaged more than 1.5 million community members and brought joy to over 11 million kids. As we look to the future, we&#8217;ll continue our efforts to build collective action and community opportunity, spark hope and enable kids to reach their full potential. And we promise that we won&#8217;t stop until we put an end to playspace inequity. For good.&#8221;<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kaboom_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for KABOOM!\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kaboom_mark_and_avatar.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for KABOOM!\" \/>\n<figcaption>Mark and social media avatars.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kaboom_mark_with_kids.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for KABOOM!\" \/>\n<figcaption>Mark with kids.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kaboom_color_palette.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for KABOOM!\" \/>\n<figcaption>Color palette.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kaboom_business_cards.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for KABOOM!\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kaboom_sketch_pads.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for KABOOM!\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sketch pad sheet.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kaboom_banner.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for KABOOM!\" \/>\n<figcaption>Banner.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kaboom_playground_sign.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for KABOOM!\" \/>\n<figcaption>Playground sign.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"(Est. 1996) &quot;KABOOM! works with communities to build incredible, kid-designed playspaces that help give kids in every zip code the opportunity to thrive.
