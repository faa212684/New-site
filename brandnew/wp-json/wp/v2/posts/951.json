With 7,000 employees in New Zealand and another 1,600 in Australia, Telecom operates five separate customer-facing businesses that handle everything from internet service to phone lines to corporate services and is looking to make a bigger impression on all of its customers&#8217; with a new identity launched this past October 16 with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/search\/?q=telecom%20ferry&#038;w=all\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a flashy light show at Auckland&#8217;s Ferry Building<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been speaking to customers who were strongly in favour of this new direction because of the freshness and commitment to change the new brand represents. So over the next few months you&#8217;ll see changes to our stores, websites, communications and advertising,&#8221; says Alan Gourdie, CEO Telecom Retail.<br \/<br \/>&#8220;The brand is designed to be less about us and more about our customers. Where previously it stood for telecommunications services, wires and networks, it now reflects New Zealanders doing what inspires them, and doing it on their terms,&#8221; says Mr Gourdie.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.telecom-media.co.nz\/releases_detail.asp?id=3623&#038;page=1&#038;pagesize=10\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press Release<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/telecom_night_lights_01.jpg\" alt=\"Telecom\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Telecom&#8217;s Night Lights event at Auckland&#8217;s Ferry Building.

Designworks <em>also<\/em> created the identity for Dowse that is <em>also<\/em> a scribble, see above. I only mention this early on because I think the scribble-as-logo is an idea everyone has at the sketching phase but you just kind of chug it as lame or acknowledge that it has been done before. And it doesn&#8217;t seem like Telecom even knows what to make of it; in the light show above, the logo falls like snowflakes but on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Telecoms-XT-Mobile-Network\/87315588215?ref=share\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">their Facebook page<\/a> they tepidly invite fans to tell them what their spark is because &#8220;[our new logo] kind of looks like a spark.&#8221; There is apparently a video that better explains the brand and brings the identity to life but it has been pulled from YouTube. (You can see a screen grab <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nbr.co.nz\/article\/new-telecom-logo-divides-customers-113575\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/telecom_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"Telecom\" \/><\/p>\n<p>I could have probably lived with the scribbled spark if it were flat and one-color but, oh no, let&#8217;s go ahead and add some gradients and some soft glows around the edges for no real reason because, let&#8217;s face it, it does not look cool. The typography is even more uninspired, I can really think of no other sans serif that looks more boring than this &mdash; you all might hate Gotham but at the very least you can admit that it would have been a better choice than this. I&#8217;m always amazed when large corporations opt for poorly executed work. Maybe this spark will fade away soon.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.matthewbuchanan.name\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Matthew Buchanan<\/a> for first tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_20091020_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_20091020_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_20091020_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_20091020_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,26,89],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/951"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=951"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/951\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=951"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=951"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=951"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
