It may seem like an easy way out to say &#8220;let&#8217;s make birch water packaging look like birch trees&#8221; but to actually pull it off as convincingly and elegantly as this is a hard feat. The brown stripes against the matte white material translate the essence of the birch trees without being an exact replica. The colored bands are cool and provide a great, bold contrast to the textures. If you are as curious as I was about where do you actually drink from the package, <a href=\"https:\/\/instagram.com\/p\/9lFJIFPYb6\/?taken-by=tappedtrees\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here is how<\/a>. <a href=\"http:\/\/bpando.org\/2015\/10\/27\/package-design-tapped-birch-water\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">The Working Capitol by Foreign Policy Design Group<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_workingcapitol.jpg\" alt=\"The Working Capitol by Foreign Policy Design Group\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/theworkingcapitol.com\/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Working Capitol<\/a> is a co-working space and event venue located in a reformed 1920s biscuit factory in Singapore. Mmmmm&hellip; biscuits. But I digress. The identity, designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.foreignpolicydesign.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Foreign Policy Design Group<\/a>, invokes the Euclidean Principle&#8217;s geometric construction to convey the multidisciplinary ethos of the co-working venture. The resulting identity has a faux-science aesthetic that is hard to resist as eye candy. It simply looks great when done with so much detail and finesse as here. Every little detail, typographic and graphic, about the applications has been considered and fussed with, leading to a very rich range of materials in a simple red, blue, and mint color palette. I would have also accepted a biscuit-inspired identity. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/30771663\/The-Working-Capitol-Branding\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Artefactory by Futura<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_artefactory.jpg\" alt=\"Artefactory by Futura\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.artefactory.mx\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Artefactory<\/a> is a soda fountain and quirky-object store in one, located in Queretaro, Mexico. The identity by Monterrey-based <a href=\"http:\/\/byfutura.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Futura<\/a> is also two things in one. There is a crisp, line-art aesthetic established by the logo &mdash; which is a rendering of the Soviet astronaut dog, Laika &mdash; that is then paired with awkward Ed Fella-esque typography. They really don&#8217;t go together at all but just like a soda fountain doesn&#8217;t go together with an industrial\/product design store it&#8217;s a combination you didn&#8217;t know you wanted. If they integrated the monospace-ish font from the stationery with the artsy typography that would start to be a more winning direction to go in. Still, it&#8217;s an attention-grabbing combo. <a href=\"http:\/\/byfutura.com\/portfolio\/artefactory\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/strong><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"We go all over the world this Friday with work from London, Singapore, and Monterrey&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[519,564,305],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4308"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4308"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4308\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4308"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4308"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4308"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
