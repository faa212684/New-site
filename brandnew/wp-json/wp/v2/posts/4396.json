Started by four students from Munich as a search tool for an entrepreneurship program, Stylight now has over 200 employees from 22 countries in five offices scouring the web and offers 15 country-specific websites with local retailers. Earlier this year, Stylight introduced a new logo and identity designed by the London office of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.codeandtheory.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Code &amp; Theory<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/stylight_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Stylight by Code &amp; Theory\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/stylight_logo_colors.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Stylight by Code &amp; Theory\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo in different colors.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The previous logo was fine, although a little misguided in making the &#8220;S&#8221; such a big hero; an &#8220;S&#8221; and a heart don&#8217;t really mean much and don&#8217;t quite say fashion. The new logo still doesn&#8217;t outright scream FASHION but by going with a wordmark places emphasis on the name (which is more evidently fashion-related). The wordmark is attractive at first glance and letters like the &#8220;y&#8221; and &#8220;g&#8221; are really nice but it&#8217;s never quite fully cohesive, as if different letters came from different sources. Nonetheless, it&#8217;s an improvement over the old one and it hints at the stylish selection of clothes and brands in their system.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/stylight_guidelines_mini.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Stylight by Code &amp; Theory\" \/>\n<figcaption>Mini identity guidelines.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/stylight_guidelines.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Stylight by Code &amp; Theory\" \/>\n<figcaption>Regular identity guidelines.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/stylight_shape_language.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Stylight by Code &amp; Theory\" \/>\n<figcaption>Geometric shapes.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The identity is more interesting with the introduction of a visual landscape of geometric shapes. My main complaint about the identity ingredients is about the type choices. Commercial Type&#8217;s Dala Floda is beautiful but here it&#8217;s so close to the wordmark yet it&#8217;s not really an extension of it that it becomes confusing. (At least for me, I doubt the general audience will notice.) Stag Sans, also a great typeface, feels too techie in its lighter weight and the letterform structure clashes with that of Dala Floda.

The geometric shapes, in their confetti arrangement, coupled with the 1980s &ndash; 1990s color palette are very appealing and perfectly suited for framing style content and encouraging shopping. If the typography were more on point, this could have been a runaway hit.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 2008, Stylight is an online &quot;fashion aggregator&quot; serving as a curated gateway to buy clothing and accessories from other online retailers.
