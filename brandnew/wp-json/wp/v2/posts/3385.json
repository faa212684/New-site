Responsible for spreading &#8220;awareness of Korean culture through the strengthening and development of the tourism industry,&#8221; the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.visitkorea.or.kr\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Korea Tourism Organization<\/a> has recently introduced a new destination brand for South Korea.

It&#8217;s certainly different from the typical destination brands that have literally smoothed out all the edges. Here, the rough &mdash; okay, <em>really<\/em> rough &mdash; calligraphic style could allude to a still-developing culture that hasn&#8217;t completely lost all connections to its past and traditions before the advent of technology&hellip; it also alludes to a complete disregard for pleasant letterforms. Each specific letter shape is more cringe-worthy than the next, culminating in what may be the worst-shaped &#8220;a&#8221; I have seen. But I find the reference sources &mdash; clothing and folk dance ribbons &mdash; charming and well represented. The extended &#8220;K&#8221; definitely looks like a sleeve from the traditional clothing. It&#8217;s also kind of a horrible &#8220;K&#8221; and the rationalization that it&#8217;s &#8220;two arms wide open&#8221; make me want to grab them by the wrists, punch the logo with them, and repeat &#8220;Why are you hitting yourself?&#8221; over and over. The &#8220;Imagine your&#8221; type in DIN looks too disconnected and tacked on to be very useful or memorable.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/south_korea_logo_colors.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for South Korea\" \/>\n<figcaption>Color usage.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/south_korea_patterns.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for South Korea\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/south_korea_patterms_use.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for South Korea\" \/>\n<figcaption>Patterns.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/south_korea_ads.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for South Korea\" \/>\n<figcaption>Print ads.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/f36mtSmmYFQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>TV ad.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">In application there isn&#8217;t much. There is an attempt at some semi-interesting patterns that for now are just spelled out in the guidelines but don&#8217;t appear anywhere else. There is also a set of ads that have the slightly more bombastic aesthetic appeal one would expect, with boy band Big Bang footing dreamy landscapes in a smokey cloud. Overall, it&#8217;s nice to see a less polished and massaged destination brand but, within that same approach, it could have been executed much better.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"In the past two or three years South Korean culture has risen in popularity and awareness throughout the world &mdash; from its K-pop stars like Psy to its corporate juggernauts like Samsung &mdash; increasing its tourism and business travel.
