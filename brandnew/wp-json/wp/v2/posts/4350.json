Owned by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.schibsted.es\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Schibsted Classified Media<\/a> &mdash; a holding company specializing in classified ads and job postings &mdash; Vibbo has over 40 million page views a month and more than 2.7 million active listings. The new identity was designed by Barcelona-based <a href=\"http:\/\/summa.es\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Summa<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/vibbo_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Vibbo by Summa\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail, with tagline (loosely &#8220;I live it and then I sell it&#8221;).<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The previous logo was really terrible, starting with the typography. Horribly spaced and I want to at least hope it&#8217;s an existing font and that no one spent time customizing whatever that was in the first place. The icon maybe had a good idea behind it but the lackluster icons and execution were just too rudimentary. The one good thing about the old version was the name; it was unimaginative but it was clearly about buying second-hand items and selling your own first-hand ones.<\/p>\n<p>There is <a href=\"http:\/\/prensa.vibbo.com\/2015\/11\/el-portal-segundamano-se-convierte-en.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a press release<\/a> announcing the change but it never says anything meaningful so there isn&#8217;t a clear explanation about the name. It obviously hints at &#8220;vivo&#8221; (&#8220;alive&#8221; or &#8220;I live&#8221;) and the double &#8220;B&#8221;s are probably to clear it as a trademark. The name is supported by the tagline &#8220;Lo vivo y luego lo vendo&#8221; which translates to &#8220;I live it and then I sell it&#8221;. I like the shortness of the name and it sounds nice when you say it but it&#8217;s completely unidentifiable with the service it represents &mdash; it could as easily be the name for the next Tinder.<\/p>\n<p>The new logo is interesting in that it only uses two shapes to create the letters: a stick and a half circle. The stick makes the &#8220;V&#8221; and &#8220;I&#8221; while the half circle makes the &#8220;B&#8221; and &#8220;O&#8221;. I like the self-imposed limitation and it leads to an eye-catching logo. The extra tall &#8220;B&#8221;s are slightly distracting and command a lot of attention and maybe it would have been interesting to see some more jagged overlapping like in the &#8220;V&#8221; as opposed to the very streamlined look of the other letters. The logo feels like a good starting point but one more round of visual disruption would have been done it good.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/vibbo_app_icon.png\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Vibbo by Summa\" \/>\n<figcaption>App icon.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/vibbo_ads.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Vibbo by Summa\" \/>\n<figcaption>Ads of some kind.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/EUmHNE1d5pY\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Introduction to Vibbo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">Not much in application yet. The abstract ads show potential in developing a custom visual language that looks fun and energetic while clearly supporting the construction of the logo. The animated spot to introduce the new name is very groovy and it has a great logo animation at the end. The desktop website needs a major overhaul to match the new identity as right now the clash of the old infrastructure with the new logo is quite jarring. Overall, it feels like a satisfying change that livens up an old brand.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Originally published as a classifieds newspaper in 1978 &mdash; until 2008 when it went solely online &mdash; and named Segunda Mano (Second Hand), Vibbo as it was renamed earlier this month, is the Craigslist of Spain and some parts of&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,86,26],"tags":[617,308,931,395],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4350"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4350"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4350\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4350"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4350"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4350"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
