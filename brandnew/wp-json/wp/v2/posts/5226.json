From humble beginnings with a range of four pies, Higgidy gained ground in supermarkets starting with Sainsbury&#8217;s, the second largest chain in the UK, and now available in more than 30 flavors across various other chains and retailers. The name is used as an adjective to describe the imperfectness of the pies and quiches, that highlight that they are individually handmade. This month, Higgidy introduced a new logo and packaging designed by London-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bandb-studio.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">B&amp;B Studio<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/higgidy_logo.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Higgidy by B&amp;B Studio\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo tried very hard to convey Higgidiness with the tumbling &#8220;g&#8221; and tagline on a curve. It&#8217;s about what you would expect from a small, handcrafted food logo. Cute, naive, ultimately harmless, but always with potential looming around the corner. The new logo&#8217;s interpretation of Higgidiness is a hard break on the product&#8217;s name that creates a jarring wordmark but, in the end, is perfectly readable. The use of a heavy Didone is very unexpected and set inside a rough-hewn circle it&#8217;s not exactly the best of logos on its own but is surprisingly convincing on the packaging.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/higgidy_packaging_old.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Higgidy by B&amp;B Studio\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sample of old packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>Inspired by the brand&#8217;s perfectly imperfect pies, we&#8217;ve created a new positioning, visual identity and packaging for Higgidy. Featuring eclectic crockery, the packaging brings to life the brand&#8217;s philosophy that the best things in life are Higgidy, and introduces a contemporary lifestyle aesthetic into a functional masculine category.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bandb-studio.co.uk\/our-work\/higgidy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">B&amp;B Studio<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/higgidy_packaging_new.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Higgidy by B&amp;B Studio\" \/>\n<figcaption>New range of packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/higgidy_packaging_group.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Higgidy by B&amp;B Studio\" \/>\n<figcaption>Some tops.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/higgidy_packaging_all.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Higgidy by B&amp;B Studio\" \/>\n<figcaption>Pretty much all of the tops.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old packaging was very, very brown in a kind of depressing, not appetizing way. Its only saving grace was the cut-out window that provided a glimpse to the product, which looks super tasty. The line illustrations were pretty shy and didn&#8217;t add up to much. The new packaging is crazy vibrant, with a large range of illustrations &#8212; some figurative, some abstract, all painterly &#8212; adorning large swaths of each box. The illustrations are tied together by a similar color palette but they are really very distinct in style and here is where the bold, wonky-type, giant dot of a logo works its best &#8212; clearly uniting all the illustrations and remaining highly visible even against the busiest of backgrounds.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/higgidy_in_situ_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Higgidy by B&amp;B Studio\" \/>\n<figcaption>Packaging in situ.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/higgidy_packaging_individual_pie.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Higgidy by B&amp;B Studio\" \/>\n<figcaption>Individual pie packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/higgidy_packaging_individual_pie_with_plate.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Higgidy by B&amp;B Studio\" \/>\n<figcaption>On a plate.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/higgidy_packaging_individual_quiche_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Higgidy by B&amp;B Studio\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/higgidy_packaging_individual_quiche_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Higgidy by B&amp;B Studio\" \/>\n<figcaption>Quiche packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">Overall, this manages to maintain the charm of the original logo and the  quirkiness of the brand (and its name) in a way that really elevates its presence with a vibrant confidence and visual originality that most mainstream products can&#8217;t pull off.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 2003, Higgidy is a West Sussex, UK-based company making handmade pies and quiches.
