I emphasize early that the change applies only at the corporate level, the uppercase oblong logo, used for both the corporate and brand identity, will stay as the consumer brand, so you won&#8217;t miss it when you are buying your <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kraftbrands.com\/crex\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Macaroni &amp; Cheese<\/a>. So let&#8217;s get started with some press releasing.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>With a new purpose and values setting a fresh direction, Kraft Foods also gave its corporate logo a facelift to more clearly deliver &#8220;delicious.&#8221; Starting today, people around the world will begin to see the new identity that deliciously features a smile, the natural reaction to delicious foods and experiences, and a colorful flavor burst. It signals to employees, consumers and investors what the new Kraft Foods is all about.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/phx.corporate-ir.net\/phoenix.zhtml?c=129070&#038;p=irol-newsArticle&#038;ID=1257182\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press release<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kraft_foods_detail.gif\" alt=\"Kraft Foods Logo, Detail\" \/><\/p>\n<p>There really isn&#8217;t anything good to say about this logo &mdash; if I had to dig really deep I would offer that the lowercase &#8220;k&#8221; is very pretty, but that&#8217;s about it. This is such a wimpy logo for such a large corporation. The red &#8220;smile,&#8221; the colorful burst, they are all hackneyed and friendly to a degree where they are just childish. And, ohmygod, is that <a href=\"http:\/\/new.myfonts.com\/fonts\/linotype\/tekton\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tekton<\/a> in the tag line? I haven&#8217;t seen that typeface used without sarcasm or irony in a long time.<\/p>\n<p>Brandweek has <a href=\"http:\/\/www.brandweek.com\/bw\/content_display\/news-and-features\/direct\/e3i096e104f4db9a3d2c2d9b3b2b4b25093?pn=1<br \/>\n&#8221; target=&#8221;_blank&#8221;>a nice slideshow of all of Kraft&#8217;s previous logos<\/a> and AdAge has <a href=\"http:\/\/adage.com\/article?article_id=134664\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a picture of the logo being, literally, unveiled<\/a>. No specific credit for the identity has been given, but London-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nitrogroup.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nitro<\/a> gets mentioned a few times as the creative agency. It&#8217;s logos like this that make you wonder if corporate identity in the 1960s had it right: Just make everything Helvetica.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Thanks to all that sent in the tip, first call goes to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.logodesignlove.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">David Airey<\/a>.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,36,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/772"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=772"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/772\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=772"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=772"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=772"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
