Metro by T-Mobile provides nationwide talk, text, and data depending on the plan services using GSM, HSPA, HSPA+ and 4G LTE networks. Metro previously operated the fifth largest mobile telecommunications network in the United States using code division multiple access (hence &#8220;PCS&#8221; in their name). The legacy MetroPCS CDMA network was decommissioned on June 21, 2015.[2] Its legacy 4G network using LTE will be integrated with T-Mobile US&#8217;s own 4G LTE network. On September 24, 2018, T-Mobile announced that the brand MetroPCS will cease to exist in October 2018, becoming Metro by T-Mobile.&#8221; (<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Metro_by_T-Mobile\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wikipedia<\/a>)<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/metro_tmobile_logo.png\" alt=\"New Name and Logo for Metro by T-Mobile\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/metro_tmobile_introduction.jpg\" alt=\"New Name and Logo for Metro by T-Mobile\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/w4_KCIPtMLs\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>T-Mobile US CEO John Legere presents the new name and logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/metro_tmobile_introduction_other_dude.jpg\" alt=\"New Name and Logo for Metro by T-Mobile\" \/>\n<figcaption>Tom Keys, President of MetroPCS at T-Mobile, sports an embroidered logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"(Est. 1994, previously MetroPCS) &quot;Metro by T-Mobile, commonly referred to as simply Metro, is a prepaid wireless service brand in the United States that is part of T-Mobile US, Inc..
