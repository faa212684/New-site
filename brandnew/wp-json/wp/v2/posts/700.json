The hospital has already gone through <a href=\"http:\/\/www.seattlechildrens.org\/home\/about_childrens\/namehistory.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">five different names and four different logos<\/a>, and this month it was introduced anew on both counts. It has gone from the broad Children&#8217;s Hospital and Regional Medical Center to a much more specific, memorable and relevant <a href=\"http:\/\/www.seattlechildrens.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Seattle Children&#8217;s<\/a>. And the new logo has vastly improved from an extremely dated ITC-esque sans serif to a wonderful new logo coupled with a simple sans.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/seattle_childrens_detail.gif\" alt=\"Seattle Children's Logo, Detail\" \/><\/p>\n<blockquote>And the whales?<br \/>They&#8217;re quintessentially Northwest, inspired by regional artwork. Our new logo depicts the compassion and trust that can be found in any number of relationships familiar to us at Children&#8217;s, including parent and child, family and community, hospital and generous supporter or care provider and patient. Plus, they are already featured prominently throughout our hospital.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.seattlechildrens.org\/home\/about_childrens\/childrens_news.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">>Press release<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p>I can&#8217;t say enough good things about the new icon, it&#8217;s endearing, it&#8217;s relevant, it&#8217;s contextually appropriate and it is beautifully rendered and executed. It also avoids the literal by being a metaphor for the security and care that, as a parent, you would want a hospital to have. One of the best logos that has come through these pages in a while.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Thanks to Kenneth Gow and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.selikoffco.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jon Selikoff<\/a> for the tip.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,72,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/700"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=700"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/700\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=700"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=700"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=700"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
