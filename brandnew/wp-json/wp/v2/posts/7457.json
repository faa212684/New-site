The packaging, designed by D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.designstudio-bob.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Designstudio B.O.B.<\/a>, employs a bevy of tiny illustrations that range from the descriptive, like watermelon or vanilla to identify flavors, to the metaphysical, like the yin yang or all-seeing-eye. The illustrations are nice and everything but it&#8217;s their use at such small sizes that makes them more interesting and in particular their use on the tear-away plastic wrap where they contrast perfectly with the white caps. The texture in each of the products is really great and given that CBD oil containers are so tiny these ones pack a punch. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.designstudio-bob.com\/aur-body\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Atlanta Brewing Company by CODO Design<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_atlanta_brewing_company.jpg\" alt=\"Atlanta Brewing Company by CODO Design\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/atlantabrewing.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Atlanta Brewing Company<\/a>, formerly Red Brick Brewing (from 2010 to 2018), is Atlanta, GA&#8217;s oldest craft brewery. Last year, to commemorate their 25th anniversary, the brewery went back to its original name and introduced a new identity and packaging designed by Indianapolis, IN-based <a href=\"https:\/\/cododesign.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CODO Design<\/a>. With a killer script logo as the anchor, that can be neatly shortened to &#8220;Atl&#8221;, the identity and packaging complement it with simple and bold typography, large color blocks, and lovely typographic details throughout.   <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/cododesign.com\/rebranding-red-brick-brewing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">360ME by Studio Makgill<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_360ME.jpg\" alt=\"360ME by Studio Makgill\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">360ME is a new range of natural &#8220;mood nutrition&#8221; supplements created by Salisbury, UK-based psychotherapist, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.themontgomerypractice.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Evelyn Montgomery<\/a>. Designed by Brighton, UK-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.studiomakgill.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Studio Makgill<\/a>, the packaging has a crisp and clean grid layout with a fairly clinical vibe but offset by the colorful dots that look like bright spots on gloomy days. The type all around the stark white boxes is quite nice and I just love how orderly everything is.
