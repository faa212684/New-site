To capture the improvisational nature of Jazz, D&aacute;niel created a generative wordmark that reacts to sound, by distributing &#8220;the different hertz values among the letters of the word &#8216;LAMANTIN&#8217;,&#8221; where &#8220;every time a certain value is sounded, the corresponding character springs into motion. The movement&#8217;s intensity is dictated by the volume of the note.&#8221; You can get a taste in the video above but to really appreciate the nuance with which the letters react you can see a working sample <a href=\"http:\/\/hiddencharacters.github.io\/lamantin\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a> with preloaded jazz tunes and\/or input from your microphone. The wordmark itself is quite nice and D&aacute;niel has built a comprehensive system around it that&#8217;s well worth a look. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/17195287\/Lamantin-Identity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Echo Capital by Tr&uuml;f<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_echo.gif\" alt=\"Echo Capital by Tr&uuml;f\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">With offices in Denver, Los Angeles, and San Francisco, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.echocapital.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Echo Capital<\/a> is an investment firm focusing on investing in young entrepreneurial types and its minimal logo and identity have been designed by Santa Monica, CA-based <a href=\"http:\/\/trufcreative.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tr&uuml;f<\/a>. Avoiding &#8220;echo-o-o-o-o&#8221; clich&eacute;s, the identity has a fresh, contemporary feel through an elegant color palette and engaging set of patterns made out of squares and circles. I love how the logo takes some actual effort to decipher and it doesn&#8217;t take any shortcuts to do it. The website is pretty snazzy too. <a href=\"http:\/\/trufcreative.com\/work\/project\/echo-capital-group\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Bar Brutal by Lo Siento<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_barbrutal.jpg\" alt=\"Bar Brutal by Lo Siento\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">I was on the fence about posting this identity and restaurant graphics for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cancisa.cat\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bar Brutal<\/a> in Barcelona, designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.losiento.net\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lo Siento<\/a>. We&#8217;ve seen the painterly approach before and probably done more ambitiously but that brush &#8220;B&#8221; is to die for and the sign painting on the windows oozes vernacular charm. (The text in the image above, by the way, translates loosely into &#8220;To cool the belly&#8221;). The identity goes into a few other brush styles but the most effective and attractive is definitely the condensed sans where the height of the letters break up the streak of the brush in very sexy ways. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.losiento.net\/entry\/bar-brutal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project here<\/strong><\/a><\/strong>.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Plenty of rich, textural work today on Friday Likes with work from Budapest, Santa Monica, and Barcelona&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[718,454,769],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3443"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3443"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3443\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3443"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3443"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3443"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
