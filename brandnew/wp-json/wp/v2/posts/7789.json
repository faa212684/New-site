Moving to New York, NY, in 1870, FAO Schwarz opened its flagship store in the General Motors Building on Fifth Avenue, made famous by Tom Hanks&#8217; <em>Big<\/em> in 1988. Since then, the toy store has had many ups and downs: going through multiple ownership changes, opening as many as 40 retail stores, filed for bankruptcy twice in the early 2000s, and ultimately (and most dramatically) closing its flagship store in 2015. In 2016, ThreeSixty Group acquired it from Toys &#8216;R&#8217; Us and since 2017 has been rolling out a new identity, designed by Orange County, CA-based <a href=\"http:\/\/mattsoncreative.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mattson Creative<\/a>, that finally hit the big stage when they reopened FAO Schwarz in a new location in Rockefeller Center on November 16, 2018.<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fao_schwarz_2019_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for FAO Schwarz by Mattson Creative\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fao_schwarz_2019_logo_glitz.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for FAO Schwarz by Mattson Creative\" \/>\n<figcaption>Full-render logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo, that made its debut  <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fao_schwarzs_new_hire_wit.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">way back in 2010<\/a>, introduced a creepy harlequin and some okay but not great typography. In the years since then, FAO Schwarz has, as related to me by Mattson Creative, used multiple different logos and this new version, in a way, feels like it&#8217;s been the FAO Schwarz logo for decades. It&#8217;s simple and classic, with an elegant flared serif and while, in general, I am not a fan of fleuron-like elements, the holding shape adds a nostalgic, vintage touch to the logo. But, to be honest, we are not here for the logo and I know this identity is not exactly the most breaking of news but the identity system is all kinds of awesome.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fao_schwarz_2019_patterns.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for FAO Schwarz by Mattson Creative\" \/>\n<figcaption>Patterns.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fao_schwarz_2019_bags_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for FAO Schwarz by Mattson Creative\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fao_schwarz_2019_bags_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for FAO Schwarz by Mattson Creative\" \/>\n<figcaption>Bags.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The system hinges on a set of delightful patterns that evoke the idea of toys without referencing any particular kind of toy through abstract representations of fun things like cars and balloons and trains and candy and robots that are perfectly on cue regardless of whether you go there to buy LEGO, create a Build-a-Bear, or leave with only bags of candy. The color palette of black, red, pink, gold, and white is amazingly perfect for all genders and all ages and the overall combination of design elements makes it feel both accessible and luxurious (maybe more the latter, but still). The patterns can be cropped to focus only on a few elements, they can be mixed and matched, they can be repeated endlessly, and they can be easily accentuated by the fleuron-shaped logo.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fao_schwarz_2019_boxes_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for FAO Schwarz by Mattson Creative\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sample packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fao_schwarz_2019_boxes_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for FAO Schwarz by Mattson Creative\" \/>\n<figcaption>Box templates.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fao_schwarz_2019_packaging.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for FAO Schwarz by Mattson Creative\" \/>\n<figcaption>Actual packaging.

The whole store is the identity system, from the shelves to the wallpaper to the products and while you might think &#8220;Isn&#8217;t that too much?&#8221; you would be right, and it&#8217;s glorious.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fao_schwarz_2019_popup_book.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for FAO Schwarz by Mattson Creative\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fao_schwarz_2019_merch_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for FAO Schwarz by Mattson Creative\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fao_schwarz_2019_merch_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for FAO Schwarz by Mattson Creative\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fao_schwarz_2019_merch_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for FAO Schwarz by Mattson Creative\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fao_schwarz_2019_merch_04_pins.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for FAO Schwarz by Mattson Creative\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/fao_schwarz_2019_merch_04_keychains.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for FAO Schwarz by Mattson Creative\" \/>\n<figcaption>Merch.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">Even the dreamed-up merchandise becomes a reality in this project, with some great FAO Schwarz-brand products that are down-tight covetable and collectible.
