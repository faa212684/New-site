So if it happens I&#8217;ll just post it separately). This is possibly one of the biggest rebrandings that will take place over the next months\/years as was announced this week that Pepsi will be revamping the design and identities of their key brands, in light of the decrease in sales with drops between 2% and 5% in different beverage categories. No visuals, other than the logo above, have been released so this is definitely a preemptive review of the work done by New York-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.arnellgroup.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Arnell Group<\/a>. There is plenty of quotables from the only two sources that have reported on the imminent change, so let&#8217;s get to those.<\/p><!--more--><p><a href=\"http:\/\/adage.com\/article?article_id=131733\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">From AdAdge.com<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote>PepsiCo today said it will pour some $1.2 billion over three years into a push that will include sweeping changes to its brands, including what Chairman-CEO Indra Nooyi characterized as a revamp of &#8220;every aspect of the brand proposition for our key [carbonated soft drink] brands. How they look, how they&#8217;re packaged, how they will be merchandised on the shelves, and how they connect with consumers.&#8221;<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>&#8220;Tropicana will also be differentiated, enabling us to re-engage consumers with this iconic brand.&#8221;<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>&#8220;We&#8217;re initiating similar upgrades for the entire Gatorade line, which will have an entirely new contemporary identity, and there will be exciting innovations for both G2 and Tiger and a renewed Propel platform.&#8221;<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>The white band in the middle of the logo will now loosely form a series of smiles. A &#8220;smile&#8221; will characterize brand Pepsi, while a &#8220;grin&#8221; is used for Diet Pepsi and a &#8220;laugh&#8221; is used for Pepsi Max. Also, Mountain Dew will be rebranded as Mtn Dew. The news was first reported in Beverage Digest.<\/blockquote>\n<p>And <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bevnet.com\/news\/2008\/10-13-2008-pepsi_redesign.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">from BevNET.com<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote>The brand&#8217;s blue and red globe trademark will become a series of &#8220;smiles,&#8221; with the central white band arcing at different angles depending on the product. Pepsi, Diet Pepsi and Pepsi Max will use all lower-case fonts for name brands. Gatorade will also receive a redesign, focusing the brand on the letter G.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>Changes will include a graphical redesign of core Pepsi CSDs Pepsi, Mountain Dew and Sierra Mist and a rebranding of some products. Mountain Dew will be renamed as &#8220;Mtn Dew&#8221; on packages, and Diet Pepsi Max will be known as simply Pepsi Max.<\/blockquote>\n<p>Maybe some extended quoting going on, but since there is little information and no visuals I figured this was the best way to share the news.<\/p>\n<p>I feel this has the potential to be quite good and groundbreaking &mdash; specially when you consider the masiveness of Pepsi &mdash; but just as well it can easily be trite, corny and lame. I know, great insight right? I do like the idea of the smiling logo as it clearly retains the equity of the old logo and it signals a move towards a friendlier and more adventuresome attitude. However, they are setting themselves up for endless parodies of the logo, and I&#8217;m sure we will see some naughty things come up. Should be interesting to see this story develop.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,51,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/711"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=711"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/711\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=711"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=711"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=711"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
