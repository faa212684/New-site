It is a Fortune 500 company with revenues in the billions-of-dollars realm. Towards the end of the year in 2009, they introduced a new brand positioning and identity created by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.landor.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Landor<\/a>. <\/p><!--more--><blockquote>The visual expression of the new AECOM results in a dynamic identity and look and feel system that extends across all points of touch. At the heart of it is the AECOM color spectrum&#8211;best seen in the letter &#8220;E&#8221; of the word mark&#8211;which is representative of the broad range of people, experiences, and expertise that make up the seamless organization. Landor activated the brand across a wide range of media, including print, digital, and environment applications, and consulted with Landor&#8217;s sister company, VML, on the website consolidation and redesign.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.landor.com\/index.cfm?do=news.pressrelease&#038;storyid=764&#038;bhcp=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Landor Press Release<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p>When it comes to logos for major corporations you have to adjust your expectations to what can be commonly achieved, which is usually a conservative identity with a small, relatively creative gesture that manages to be accepted by a wide range of interested parties within the company. In this case, within a somewhat dated uppercase italic wordmark is a relatively creative &#8220;E&#8221; that not only lacks its stem but the middle bar is a blue-to-green gradient. Not earth shattering, but you can imagine how this could be the focus of endless meetings before approval. The final combination is somewhat pleasing and welcome even if it does feel a little like 1970s-corporate-identity; perhaps a more contemporary sans serif would have been better. It&#8217;s also nice to see some black in this logo, a color that more and more corporations seem to stay away from because it can perceived as harsh.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/aecom_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"Aecom\" \/><\/p>\n<blockquote>&#8220;Just as important as the logo is our messaging platform and the attributes that define the AECOM brand,&#8221; said Paul Gennaro, AECOM senior vice president and chief communications officer. &#8220;According to those who know us best, our clients and staff, the brand attributes that describe AECOM are: Connected, Ingenuity, Driven, Vision, and Ally. These brand attributes support our brand positioning statement: The seamless integration within AECOM ignites collaborative excellence, empowering us to enhance and sustain the world&#8217;s built, natural, and social environments.&#8221;<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.landor.com\/index.cfm?do=news.pressrelease&#038;storyid=764&#038;bhcp=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Landor Press Release<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/aecom_brochure_cover.gif\" alt=\"Aecom\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Corporate brochure cover.

(Tip to brand consultants: When you upload a &#8220;final&#8221; PDF to your global client&#8217;s web site, don&#8217;t name the file &#8220;final,&#8221; your client&#8217;s clients assume it&#8217;s final. Plus, it&#8217;s tacky.)<\/p>\n<p>The brand message is what you would expect from a large corporation and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.aecom.com\/Careers\/We+Are+AECOM\" targe=\"_blank\">this video<\/a> shows how easy it is to make a brand statement sound and appear clich&eacute;d. And there is something very weird about the &#8220;Partnering More Powerfully&#8221; line. Nonetheless, compared to what AECOM had previously, this is all a better presentation.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to Timothy King for the tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_100503_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_100503_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"574\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,36,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1091"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1091"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1091\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1091"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1091"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1091"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
