So, maybe unrelated, a little facelift was in order for the Timberwolves, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nba.com\/timberwolves\/news\/timberwolves_logo_undergoes_facelift_080625.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">who unveiled a refreshed primary logo<\/a> during last week&#8217;s NBA Draft. It&#8217;s a fun game of spot the differences, and there are some nice tweaks like the highlight in the wolf&#8217;s face, and the lettering is less fangy.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/timberwolves_detail.gif\"alt=\"Minnesota Timberwolves Logo, Detail\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Along with the revisions to the primary logo, the Timberwolves introduced two alternate logos. The first is just the wolf from the primary logo, and the second is an integration of the wolf with a basketball &mdash; it&#8217;s interesting that, for the last dozen years, the Timberwolves were one of the few teams without a basketball in their primary or alternate logos. The second alternate is also a nod to the team&#8217;s original logo. Designed by Adidas, the new logos are a nice update and extension from the original without reinventing the wheel. Hopefully, in the search for a new Garnett, the Timberwolves won&#8217;t settle for a &mdash; bad pun alert! &mdash; rebound relationship. <\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/timberwolves_alternate.gif\"alt=\"Minnesota Timberwolves Logo, Alternates\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Thanks to Sara Ronald for the tip.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,26,87],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/659"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=659"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/659\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=659"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=659"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=659"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
