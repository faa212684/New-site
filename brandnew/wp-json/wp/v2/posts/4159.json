Its interiors and covered patio <a href=\"http:\/\/www.urbandaddy.com\/slideshow\/bos\/5908\/Banyan_Bar_Refuge_Slideshow_Boston_BOS#slide-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">feature<\/a> branches and bamboo, which led to the moody, branchy identity by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/adamnco.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Adam&amp;Co.<\/a>. that, in my mind, is like the aesthetic baby of Rambo&#8217;s <em>First Blood<\/em> and <em>The Great Gatsby<\/em>: Jungle-y but luxurious. The drippy logo works nicely against the layered, moss- and gold-colored photos and there are some nice typographic details throughout. The food doesn&#8217;t look bad either. <a href=\"http:\/\/adamnco.com\/work\/banyan-restaurant\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Tony Ferguson by MAUD<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_tonyferguson.jpg\" alt=\"Tony Ferguson by MAUD\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.tonyferguson.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tony Ferguson<\/a> is a weight loss program in Australia based on meal replacement through shakes and other snacks. (For the record: UCllc does not endorse this type of diet, we urge you to put down that Cinabbon and go out for a run around the block). (Also: this Tony Ferguson has nothing to do with mixed martial arts fighter <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tony_Ferguson\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tony Ferguson<\/a>). On to the identity by Surry Hills-based <a href=\"http:\/\/maud.com.au\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MAUD<\/a>: At first glance this looks like a dozen other package systems that use heavily spaced white backgrounds, simple typography, and a product depiction. What I like about this is that it makes sense for the product as it&#8217;s all about conveying a sense of lightness. It also manages to look both clinical\/science-y like something that would come from a lab but also has the familiarity of a grocery store product. The typography, layout, and super minimal ingredient photos are all very well calibrated to create a smart, attractive system that if you are going to meal-replace you should at least meal-replace while looking this good. <a href=\"http:\/\/maud.com.au\/#\/tony-ferguson\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Grano by BOND<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_grano.jpg\" alt=\"Grano by BOND\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.grano.fi\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Grano<\/a> is a print and digital marketing production house with locations across Finland. It may seem like an odd choice for Friday Likes but I am highly enjoying the simplicity and modularity of the identity by Helsinki-based <a href=\"http:\/\/bond-agency.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BOND<\/a>. Typeset in Gotham (I think) the skewed wordmark and its accompanying underlines create a great rhythm and produce a highly energetic vibe &mdash; the yellow and black color palette almost make it look like Caution: Electricity Danger Ahead signs.
