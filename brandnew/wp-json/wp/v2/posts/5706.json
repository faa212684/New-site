Carius is available in nine of the 102 departments of France and is operated by Sant\u00e9 Mobilit\u00e9 Services.

I know what you are thinking: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/carius_logo_construction_this.png\" target=\"_blank\">this<\/a>.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>It&#8217;s only Tuesday but so far it has been a good week for pictorial icons on Brand New with the addition of this fluorescent green bee. I like the concept of comparing a bee with an ambulance and the idea of a swarm of ambulances buzzing around a city ready to break in any given direction and help someone. The heart part of the formula is a bonus conceptually but it&#8217;s just a little too narrow to fully come across as a heart &#8212; the wings would have had to be rounder but then it might lose the bee shape. Still, it&#8217;s a crisp and bold icon that has a great presence. The wordmark feels very heavy, being in black and so big in relationship to the icon when locked-up horizontally; there is much better harmony in the partner logo (below) where the wordmark is white and the same width as the icon.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/carius_badge.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Carius by Content Design Lab\" \/>\n<figcaption>Partner logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/173336178?title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Service introduction.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>I&#8217;m hoping the video above is an interim kind of solution before Carius pumps some budget into it. It starts out promising with the faded city behind a cool rendering of the ambulances but then they introduce humans and it looks so cheap that it almost takes away from the whole brand, making it seem like its an ambulance service geared towards transporting kids. I&#8217;m all for being approachable and friendly but sometimes these illustrations &#8212; also thinking of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/follow_up_new_name_logo_and_identity_for_mr_cooper_by_phenomenom.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mr. Cooper<\/a> &#8212; are not as grown-up as they need to be.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/carius_business_cards.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Carius by Content Design Lab\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/carius_something.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Carius by Content Design Lab\" \/>\n<figcaption>Some kind of something flat.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/carius_livery_uniforms.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Carius by Content Design Lab\" \/>\n<figcaption>Uniforms.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/carius_livery.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Carius by Content Design Lab\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/carius_livery_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Carius by Content Design Lab\" \/>\n<figcaption>Livery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">The limited showing of identity materials are okay and nothing to get to excited about. The uniforms, with the single green badge on the shirt are pretty nice as is the livery with the badge &#8220;hanging&#8221; from the window. Check out the painted side view mirrors &#8212; love that! The livery reminds me of a lite version of <a href=\"http:\/\/studiodumbar.com\/work\/dutch-police\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dunbar&#8217;s work for the Dutch Police<\/a>. Overall, this is solid design in an industry &#8212; private service ambulances &#8212; where design of any kind is not expected and here they have done something thoughtful and visually engaging.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 2016, Carius is a new, independent transportation network of ambulances for medical patients that are ordered through a mobile app, where you can track how close it is to getting to you.
