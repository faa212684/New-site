Before copying-pasting the above description my only impression of Pitney Bowes is that they sold <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=pitney+bowes+postage+machine&#038;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS503US503&#038;espv=2&#038;biw=1356&#038;bih=566&#038;source=lnms&#038;tbm=isch&#038;sa=X&#038;ei=rUK-VNfaJonksAS0goHQDg&#038;ved=0CAcQ_AUoAg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">postage-printing machines<\/a> and had a funny name. It seems that&#8217;s exactly the challenge they wanted to overcome and position the company as more than just a postage printer. To that end, this past week, Pitney Bowes introduced a new identity designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.futurebrand.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Futurebrand<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>Repositioning Pitney Bowes as a leader in the hyper-connected world of physical and digital commerce required a new outlook and a rigorous, fact-based approach. The refreshed brand is built on a singular idea&mdash;that Pitney Bowes delivers precision and accuracy to create meaningful impact for clients. This idea highlights Pitney Bowes&#8217;s unique point of difference in terms that are clearly understood, credible and actionable across the whole of its business, from location-based intelligence to shipping &amp; mailing to global ecommerce.<\/blockquote><h3>Futurebrand provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pitney_bowes_logo_history.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Pitney Bowes by Futurebrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo history.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pitney_bowes_old_look.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Pitney Bowes by Futurebrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sampling of the old look.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The previous logo was very ambiguous and it&#8217;s no surprise it was designed in the early 1970s. It totally looks like the abstract corporate symbols of yore. So I don&#8217;t think there will be any zealots disappointed about its disappearance, unlike when Futurebrand redesigned the UPS logo. (Myself included as one of said zealots). I bring up UPS because this project reminds me a lot of it. UPS didn&#8217;t want to be known as just a package delivery service but a logistics company and here Pitney Bowes doesn&#8217;t want to be known as just a postage company but something requiring a whole paragraph of offerings. Also just like UPS, this logo and identity rely on this <a href=\"http:\/\/www.myfonts.com\/fonts\/fontfont\/ff-dax\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FF Dax-like font style<\/a> that supposedly communicates future-ness of some kind. I think you can see where this review is headed&hellip;<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pitney_bowes_concept.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Pitney Bowes by Futurebrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo concept.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>To translate the new brand positioning visually, FutureBrand created a symbol that draws from Pitney Bowes&#8217;s heritage, but in an entirely future-focused way. That meant creating a proprietary logotype paired with an ambitious symbol representing the rippling impact Pitney Bowes creates. The result is an identity that is modern, bright and dynamic, paying tribute to founders Pitney and Bowes (p and b) and symbolizing the impact of Pitney Bowes&#8217;s commerce solutions for clients around the world.<\/blockquote><h3>Futurebrand press release<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pitney_bowes_logo_detail.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Pitney Bowes by Futurebrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pitney_bowes_logo_detail_colors.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Pitney Bowes by Futurebrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Color variations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pitney_bowes_logo_activate.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Pitney Bowes by Futurebrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Press-ability.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The good thing about the new logo is that it does manage to convey a certain contemporary effect with the thumbprint monogram that plays on permeating and soon-to-be ubiquitous technology like the iPhone&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.apple.com\/iphone-6\/touch-id\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Touch ID<\/a> fingerprint screen unlocking. Unfortunately that&#8217;s as positive as I get. The &#8220;pb&#8221; monogram on its own, without the radiating lines, is awkward &mdash; the relationship between the two letters is not typographically natural, it feels very forced. Adding the concentric lines doesn&#8217;t help the letters much and the thinning effect looks very strange against the bold &#8220;pb&#8221;. The wordmark, set in all lowercase so that they &#8220;p&#8221; and &#8220;b&#8221; match the monogram lacks seriousness and has those neutered stems in the &#8220;p&#8221; and &#8220;b&#8221; that, personally, I really dislike. To end this paragraph on a more positive outlook, the logo works better small.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/DDHx_0OV6D4\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>New brand video.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/pitney_bowes_typography.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Pitney Bowes by Futurebrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Custom typography.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The pointy connection idea is good, and it works on some level.

It&#8217;s colorful and, literally, groovy. Even though I don&#8217;t find it particularly interesting or engaging, I&#8217;ll accept that it looks fresh, vibrant, and kinda fun for a corporation. Overall, this identity takes Pitney Bowes out of the 1970s and 90s into the more generic and consumer-friendly look and feel of corporations that want to look like they are &#8220;with it&#8221; but unfortunately it comes across as trying a little too hard.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1920, Pitney Bowes is a &quot;global technology company offering innovative products and solutions that enable commerce in the areas of customer information management, location intelligence, customer engagement, shipping and mailing, and global ecommerce.&quot; When I do reviews, I&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,36,26],"tags":[147,32,1131],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3717"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3717"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3717\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3717"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3717"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3717"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
