Bending the &#8220;T&#8221; into a smile is charming and clever but you could also see it as having a bit of an edge given how typographically distorted the &#8220;T&#8221; actually gets.

But maybe I&#8217;m reading too much into it. The fonts are big, the lines are thick, the colors are bold &#8212; it&#8217;s hard to not to like it. For a comedy festival, though, the copywriting and visual puns on the materials are not exactly the funniest &#8212; except for the pizza slice that says &#8220;so kneady&#8221;.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/comedy_feast_comedian_descriptions.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Comedy Feast by Only\" \/>\n<figcaption>Comedian descriptions.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/comedy_feast_locations.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Comedy Feast by Only\" \/>\n<figcaption>Locations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/comedy_feast_laughing.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Comedy Feast by Only\" \/>\n<figcaption>Laughing variations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/comedy_feast_food_warnings.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Comedy Feast by Only\" \/>\n<figcaption>Food warnings.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/comedy_feast_wall.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Comedy Feast by Only\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/comedy_feast_entrance.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Comedy Feast by Only\" \/>\n<figcaption>Event graphics.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">Overall, this hits the right tone and has a number of visual expressions to sustain an identity for multiple events where it can feel varied but not entirely repetitive.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Celebrated for the first time in Summer of 2017, Comedy Feast is a multi-day comedy festival coupled with a food and drink festival.
