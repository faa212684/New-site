As a logo (old or new) it isn&#8217;t the most interesting or innovative, just a serif with an ambiguous grain going across it and ending as the tittle of the &#8220;i&#8221; &#8212; a detail that JKR has taken advantage of below to introduce a &#8220;hi&#8221; graphic that doesn&#8217;t seem to appear anywhere else at the moment but is cute nonetheless. The revised grain is smoother and the revised serif is sharper. Hard to argue against it and it helps shed some of the Kumbaya aesthetic of the wobbly grain. Taking the logo out of the horrible holding shape with its weird border is, on its own, reason to celebrate.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kashi_logo_hi.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Kashi by Jones Knowles Ritchie\" \/>\n<figcaption>&#8220;Hi&#8221; version.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kashi_business_cards.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Kashi by Jones Knowles Ritchie\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>As a healthy food pioneer for over 30 years, Kashi has always been committed to creating foods that enable uplifting health. With an entire portfolio of Non-GMO Project Verified products and ever-increasing organic offerings, Kashi sought to develop packaging to better reflect its progressive food values, highlight the stories behind the foods and also revisit some of the inspiration from its original packaging. Kashi was one of the first brands to use white cereal boxes and, with this packaging refresh, is again shaking up the natural and organic category with a bold departure from imagery reliant on farm and field visuals. The new design features food front and center against a clean white canvas and accented with a design that is unmistakably contemporary &#8211; with clean lines, vivid colors and straightforward typography.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/kashi-unveils-new-look-proving-good-food-and-good-design-gotogether-300297102.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kashi press release<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kashi_photo_style_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Kashi by Jones Knowles Ritchie\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kashi_photo_style_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Kashi by Jones Knowles Ritchie\" \/>\n<figcaption>Photo styling.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>As you&#8217;ll see in the packaging below, one of the things that makes it work so well is the literally straightforward food photography. It makes a good case for WYSIWYG, looking natural and simple.<\/p>\n<blockquote>Kashi is also one of the first brands to incorporate editorial-style stories on all packaging about how the food was made and where it comes from &#8211; including employees, farmers and friends of Kashi who had a deep impact on it.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/kashi-unveils-new-look-proving-good-food-and-good-design-gotogether-300297102.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kashi press release<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kashi_old_look.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Kashi by Jones Knowles Ritchie\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sampling of the old look.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kashi_cereal_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Kashi by Jones Knowles Ritchie\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kashi_cereal_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Kashi by Jones Knowles Ritchie\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kashi_cereal_IRL.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Kashi by Jones Knowles Ritchie\" \/>\n<figcaption>Cereal boxes.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kashi_various_packaging.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Kashi by Jones Knowles Ritchie\" \/>\n<figcaption>Various.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old packaging was semi okay but there was nothing distinctive about it &#8212; even its claim as being one of the first cereal boxes to be white now isn&#8217;t that special as a lot of food products have gone white. The sampling of old packaging I cobbled together may not be the most chronologically accurate and there is probably old and new stuff mixed in but there is little consistency and a free-for-all of make-it-look-organic-! graphic devices. The new packaging is amazingly simple and restrained, with a big, detailed photo of the product, a big logo, and information neatly organized into tiny compartments. The &#8220;Organic Indigo Morning&#8221; box is so good. They have managed to take the white-space-big-product-photo trend and make it feel fresh and contemporary or at least more refined. The supporting use of Lineto&#8217;s Circular doesn&#8217;t feel quite right and not just because it&#8217;s yet another use of Circular but it&#8217;s operating on a different graphic wavelength as the logo and product image. Maybe even a lighter weight of it would have worked better.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kashi_ad_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Kashi by Jones Knowles Ritchie\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kashi_ad_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Kashi by Jones Knowles Ritchie\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kashi_billboard.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Kashi by Jones Knowles Ritchie\" \/>\n<figcaption>Ads and stuff.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">Overall, the packaging and ads are an interesting blend of retail and editorial design that make the products look like very tasty annual reports. The change would have benefited from a newer-er logo but I can understand that they would want to keep that equity. Now, about that Dark Cocoa Karma cereal, let&#8217;s put some of that in my belly.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1984, Kashi produces natural and plant-based foods including cereals, powders, entrees, and snacks.
