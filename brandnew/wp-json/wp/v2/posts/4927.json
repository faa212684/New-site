The logo, designed by local designer <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/lakieszti\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Eszter Laki<\/a> features a tiger &#8212; a national symbol in many Asian countries &#8212; that has been urbanized with a hat that brilliantly integrates the crescent moon and star of <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Flag_of_Malaysia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the Malaysian flag<\/a> and that makes the tiger look totally boss. It&#8217;s a great drawing of a tiger and the hat just kills me. In application things are pretty straightforward and keep the focus on the tiger rendered in gold foil on the menus and gold ink in other places. It&#8217;s grrrrreat. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/42953801\/URBAN-TIGER\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Notel by Self-titled<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_notel.jpg\" alt=\"Notel by Self-titled\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/notelmelbourne.com.au\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Notel<\/a> is not your typical hotel: it&#8217;s located on the roof of a parking garage in Melbourne, Australia, and the rooms consist of six chrome Airstream trailers. You could say it&#8217;s not a hotel&#8230; or Notel. The logo, designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/selftitled.com.au\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Self-titled<\/a> bluntly (but paradoxically also subtly) notes the contradiction of the name by having a prohibited slash across the &#8220;O&#8221;, like a reversed-out <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/No_symbol\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">No Sign<\/a>. It&#8217;s almost imperceptible &#8212; I&#8217;ll admit it took me a couple of viewings to get it &#8212; but adds to the deadpan-ness of the hotel and how it acts like it&#8217;s no big deal that they are on top of a parking garage. The logo and identity itself are not show-stoppers but Self-titled helped shape the look of the hotel by commissioning <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/ash_keating\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ash Keating<\/a> and his paint-spewing fire extinguishers to do the mural that helps offset the starkness of the Airstreams and the logo and the integration of all the elements is quite stunning. <a href=\"http:\/\/selftitled.com.au\/project\/notel\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">BarKas by Province Design Studio<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_barkas.jpg\" alt=\"BarKas by Province Design Studio\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/barkas.olimpiya\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BarKas<\/a> is the private, corporate restaurant at the headquarters of Kaspersky Lab &#8212; a very large international software security group &#8212; in Moscow, Russia. (The name Kas is short for Kaspersky.) Designed by Tomsk, Russia-based <a href=\"http:\/\/provincestudio.ru\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Province Design Studio<\/a>, the identity follows an 8-bit aesthetic that starts at the logo with a simple combination of regular sans serif for &#8220;Bar&#8221; and pixel font for &#8220;Kas&#8221;. Nothing extraordinary really and even the identity itself lacks the usual graphic outburst of a Friday Like but the fact that something like this exists in real life and is not just a fake concept on Behance is very much worthy of a note. The applications could use some refining or pushing of boundaries but all the food- and kitchen-related pixel illustrations are charming, playful, and irreverent. The menu with the puffy icons looks killer and the staff badges are awesome. As a bonus there is <a href=\"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/175793219\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a fun 8-bit video<\/a> featuring a chef chasing a pig and a chicken, Mario Bros.-style. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/42463001\/BARKAS\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"An eclectic mix of playful, subtle, and 8-bit projects this week with work from Budapest, Melbourne, and Tomsk&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[633,564],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4927"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4927"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4927\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4927"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4927"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4927"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
