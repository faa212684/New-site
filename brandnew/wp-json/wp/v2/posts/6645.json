Beyond those few (I think) facts, things get a little fuzzy but because the logo for the company is a sea lion holding a coffee cup nothing else really matters. This project lives on local designer&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/joinhyuk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jo In Hyuk<\/a> Behance page and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/jojo1205\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">his Instagram account<\/a> is full of Fritz materials (which are also very cool and not shown at the project link) so I am guessing he either works in-house or is simply their very enthusiastic freelance designer. Regardless&#8230; the abundance of materials and packaging for the coffee company are fantastic, spanning a variety of styles (and often mixing styles) but always perfectly crafted, executed, and, most importantly, keeping the sea lion holding a coffee cup front and center. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/65435111\/FRITZ-COFFEE-COMPANY-BRANDING-Part1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Caf\u00e9 Azul Talavera by Anagrama<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_cafeazultalavera.jpg\" alt=\"Caf\u00e9 Azul Talavera by Anagrama\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.rosewoodhotels.com\/en\/puebla\/dining\/Cafe-Azul-Talavera\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Caf\u00e9 Azul Talavera<\/a> is a caf\u00e9 and restaurant inside the Rosewood hotel in Puebla, Mexico. Designed by Monterrey, Mexico-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.anagrama.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Anagrama<\/a>, the identity has a rich simplicity through a great combination of varied elements applied sparingly. The logo has three different typefaces yet it still looks simple and minimal. I like the hand-written script element that also extends to the rest of the identity and the pattern is a kind of minimalist take on the region&#8217;s popular <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Talavera_pottery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">talavera pottery<\/a>. The use of kraft in the bags and boxes adds an earthy, rugged element that complements the rustic-ness of the hotel. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.anagrama.com\/project\/cafe-azul-talavera\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">H\u00fcngry Beast by Savvy<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_hungry_beast.jpg\" alt=\"H\u00fcngry Beast by Savvy\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/thehungrybeasts\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">H\u00fcngry Beast<\/a> is a juice bar and restaurant in Mexico City focusing on healthy and organic ingredients. The identity by Mexico City-based <a href=\"http:\/\/savvy-studio.net\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Savvy<\/a> is a bit on the hipster side but the variety of the system across materials is quite satisfying. I particularly like when the &#8220;u&#8221; disappears and only the umlaut is left. The slightly grungy wordmark is very mid 1990s and being that 2020 is fast approaching it seems we are due for the 30-year-old trend to start making a comeback. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/savvy-studio.net\/hungry-beast\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"From ornate to minimalist, we cover a good range of projects this week with work from Seoul, Monterrey, and Mexico City.
