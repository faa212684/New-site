Last year, the ADC introduced a new identity designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/standapart.com.au\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Interbrand Australia<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><p>There are <em>a lot<\/em> more images at <a href=\"http:\/\/standapart.com.au\/adc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Interbrand&#8217;s project page<\/a> not included here if you feel like you need more.<\/p>\n<blockquote>Having established kids as ADC&#8217;s new primary focus, we needed to find a way to communicate with them (without excluding our other audiences). So we created a colourful and customisable identity system, inspired by building blocks &#8211; the universal symbol of creativity, discovery, and learning through play.<br \/><br \/>But it&#8217;s not all fun and games. While the system encourages curiosity and experimentation, it always puts what matters most at the centre &#8211; no matter whether that&#8217;s a global issue, an exhibition title, or simply the name of a visiting child.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/standapart.com.au\/adc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Interbrand project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/australian_design_centre_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Australian Design Centre by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/australian_design_centre_logo_flexibility_2.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Australian Design Centre by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Flexibility to be small or big with additional graphics and messages.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/australian_design_centre_logo_flexibility_square.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Australian Design Centre by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Flexibility to have different messages or showcase partnerships.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/australian_design_centre_logo_responsive.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Australian Design Centre by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo&#8217;s responsiveness.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/155334547?color=c60c30&#038;title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo&#8217;s playfulness.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/australian_design_centre_logo_with_message.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Australian Design Centre by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo with Centre&#8217;s mission.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Other than the &#8220;Object&#8221; descriptor &#8212; which was (and I think it still is) part of the official name of the Centre &#8212; there was nothing distinctive or memorable about the old logo and maybe because of the name it looked like the retail store of a museum and nothing more. The new logo is extremely simple, typesetting the name in Colophon&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.colophon-foundry.org\/fonts\/apercu\/mono\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Aper&ccedil;u Mono<\/a> and placing it in three equal color bars with a thin space between them. The plain structure then explodes into a range of possibilities by adding squares, images, textures, messaging, and more, staying consistent through the thin space between the elements and the bright color palette. I love modular approaches like this and this one works particularly well even by being fairly rudimentary.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/australian_design_centre_letterhead.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Australian Design Centre by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Letterhead.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/australian_design_centre_guidelines.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Australian Design Centre by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Guidelines.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/australian_design_centre_posters.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Australian Design Centre by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Posters.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/australian_design_centre_exterior_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Australian Design Centre by Interbrand\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/australian_design_centre_exterior_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Australian Design Centre by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Exteriors.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/australian_design_centre_interior_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Australian Design Centre by Interbrand\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/australian_design_centre_interior_04.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Australian Design Centre by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Interiors.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/australian_design_centre_interior_workshop.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Australian Design Centre by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Workshop in progress.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/australian_design_centre_interior_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Australian Design Centre by Interbrand\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/australian_design_centre_interior_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Australian Design Centre by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Blocks.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/133301895?color=c60c30&#038;title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Brand video.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">In application, the possibilities are endless &#8212; yet remain cohesive whether the identity is applied on a wall or letterhead &#8212; and establish a vibrant, playful personality for the ADC.
