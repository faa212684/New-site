The HOG is &#8216;the grandaddy of all community-building efforts,&#8217; serving to promote not just a consumer product, but a lifestyle. The HOG has also served to open new revenue streams for the company, with the production of tie-in merchandise offered to club members, numbering over one million strong making it the largest factory-sponsored riding club in the world.

HOG members typically spend 30% more than other Harley owners, on such items as clothing and Harley-Davidson-sponsored events. Much of the intent of this branding effort is presenting Harley-Davidson as an American icon, with the focus on authenticity and pride in being American-made.&#8221; (Source: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Harley_Owners_Group\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wikipedia<\/a>)<\/p><!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/harley_owners_group_patch.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Harley Owners Group by GS Design\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/harley_owners_group_patch_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Harley Owners Group by GS Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Patch.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"&quot;The Harley Owners Group (HOG) is a sponsored community marketing club, operated by Harley-Davidson for enthusiasts of that brand&apos;s motorcycles.
