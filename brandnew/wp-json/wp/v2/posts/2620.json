It&#8217;s a popular destination with multiple entertainment attractions like Busch Gardens and Legoland, major league sports teams &mdash; Tampa Bay Buccaneers (NFL), Tampa Bay Lightning (NHL), and Tampa Bay Rays (MLB) &mdash; and a number of museums and historic neighborhoods like Ybor City. But Tampa Bay has heavy competition from other Florida destinations like Orlando and Miami, so <a href=\"http:\/\/www.visittampabay.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Visit Tampa Bay<\/a> (formerly Tampa Bay &amp; Co.), an independent not-for-profit organization that &#8220;leads the effort of economic development through tourism&#8221; has introduced a new tourism brand to elevate the status of Tampa Bay. The identity has been designed by Tampa-based <a href=\"http:\/\/spark.us\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Spark<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tampa_bay_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Destination Brand for Tampa Bay by Spark\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>We leveraged the spirit of adventure and exploration that arrived here with Tampa Bay&#8217;s first visitors to create a brand that is bold and daring.<br \/><br \/>The logo is heavily inspired by iconic Tampa Bay landmarks (University of Tampa, Bayshore, Ybor City) and traditions (Gasparilla). And the tagline of &#8220;Treasure Awaits.&#8221; hints at all the discoveries to be made in Tampa Bay. The new brand is an invitation to vacationers, business travelers and residents to unlock Tampa Bay&#8217;s fearless spirit. It&#8217;s a brand that makes us all proud to call Tampa Bay home.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/spark.us\/en\/brands\/tb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Spark project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Vt4388FM-Pw\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Brand launch video.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tampa_bay_tshirt.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Destination Brand for Tampa Bay by Spark\" \/>\n<figcaption>T-shirt.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tampa_bay_scrawled.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Destination Brand for Tampa Bay by Spark\" \/>\n<figcaption>Scrawl-y type treatments.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo, well, you can see it, right? No need to beat a dead horse. At the potential of making you all wonder if I&#8217;ve lost my mind I&#8217;ll make this claim upfront: the new logo is brilliant. I (and we all) chide destination brands for being too generic and not specific enough to the history or attributes of the place it&#8217;s branding but this one is so relevant and appropriate it sets a bar. When I first saw the logo I immediately thought of their NFL team, the Buccaneers. Pirates. Skull and crossbones. The connection was instant. The bones are made up of large keys, appropriate for a city and state with rich colonial history. The skull is a keyhole &mdash; which is the only point where the logo (and the application in the video) get a little corny and annoying &mdash; that pays off on the use of the keys. Together they form a bold icon that looks fantastic on a t-shirt and establishes Tampa Bay as a contemporary and playful city. I don&#8217;t care much for the custom, Museo-ish typography but it gets the job done. There aren&#8217;t a lot of applications yet, but this looks very promising, especially with the glimpses of the hand-scrawled typography.
