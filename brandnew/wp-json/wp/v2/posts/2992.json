Self-described as &#8220;a friend, a partner, a support and a shoulder to cry on,&#8221; they encourage clients to bring their &#8220;kinky prepress, nebulous finishing, microscopic editions, absurd materials and crazy deadlines.&#8221; For two years running, their annual reports (designed Bruketa &amp; Zinic) for Adris Group have won Best of Show at our <a href=\"http:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/fpoawards\/winners.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FPO Awards<\/a>.

Extremely amateur-looking, it didn&#8217;t exude the kind of confidence a designer wants in their printer. With the new logo and identity, they are so in tune with their designer audience that it&#8217;s almost unfair to other printers who are notorious for having terrible identities and websites. The logo on its own isn&#8217;t particularly pleasing to the eye &mdash; it&#8217;s cool and hip, but some of the letterforms like the &#8220;V&#8221; and &#8220;S&#8221; don&#8217;t feel fully resolved. The custom type works better as a whole and particularly when spaced out. The logo, after all, is only a small part of the project and the identity and range of materials are stunning.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cerovski_stationary.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Cerovski by Bunch\" \/>\n<figcaption>Letterhead.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cerovski_stationary_detail.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Cerovski by Bunch\" \/>\n<figcaption>Letterhead detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cerovski_stationary_detail_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Cerovski by Bunch\" \/>\n<figcaption>Letterhead in folder.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cerovski_envelopes.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Cerovski by Bunch\" \/>\n<figcaption>Envelopes.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cerovski_tape.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Cerovski by Bunch\" \/>\n<figcaption>Tape.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cerovski_tube.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Cerovski by Bunch\" \/>\n<figcaption>Tube.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>Bunch have also introduced a smart technological element, an app created by Vedran Gulin (who also developed the website) that generates a personalised cover for Cerovski&#8217;s planners, each with a coloured cover specific to a client&#8217;s birth date as well as printing their name across the front.<\/blockquote><h3>Provided text, written by Richard Baird<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cerovski_client_folders.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Cerovski by Bunch\" \/>\n<figcaption>Client planners.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cerovski_brand_guidelines.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Cerovski by Bunch\" \/>\n<figcaption>Cerovski&#8217;s own brand guidelines.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cerovski_brand_guidelines_covers.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Cerovski by Bunch\" \/>\n<figcaption>The guidelines&#8217; different covers.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cerovski_business_card_holders.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Cerovski by Bunch\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business card boxes for delivering to clients.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Shown in this post is barely over half of the provided images &mdash; you can see more <a href=\"http:\/\/bunchdesign.com\/projects\/cerovski-p235.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/bpando.org\/2014\/02\/05\/logo-cerovski\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a> &mdash; but what&#8217;s clear is that there is no shortage of cool, design-y things to produce in whatever print method Cerovski wants and with whatever color palette that shows off their printing abilities, from metallics to bright colors to pastel hues. The little pieces of what I affectionally will call macaroni noodles lend a fun, abstract detail to the materials that help ground the otherwise minimalist layout of most pieces. Overall, this identity knows its audience and it never stops in trying to impress without resorting to fancy tricks or opulent graphics.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 2008 and located in Zagreb, Croatia, Cerovski is one of Europe&apos;s finest printers producing some of the HTF-est (How The Fuck?-est) print projects from designers and clients around the world.
