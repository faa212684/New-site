We will get back on track this week with no further interruptions until Thanksgiving week. Onward!<\/p>\n<p>Established in 2012, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.anotherplaceproductions.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Another Place<\/a> is a free-to-play mobile game studio based in London, founded by the team behind the 6-part <em><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fable_(video_game_series)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fable<\/a><\/em> series for Xbox. They have published two games so far, <em>Dragon Finga<\/em>, which has a remarkable 4.5 stars on iTunes and their just-released title, <em>Battlehand<\/em>. To coincide with the launch of the latter Another Place introduced a new logo designed by London-based <a href=\"http:\/\/proxyventures.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Proxy<\/a> with final lettering on the logo by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.robclarke.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rob Clarke<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>The team view gaming as a chance to escape to &#8216;another place&#8217;. We wanted to reflect this in the logotype, playing on the concept of the logo as a portal. It became obvious that the team&#8217;s unique character art style required a bespoke lettering style to match. Once we landed on the right metaphor we teamed up with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.robclarke.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rob Clarke<\/a>, to evolve the lettering to work with the team&#8217;s artistic style; this was then cropped and displayed in a range of bright colours.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/proxyventures.com\/projects\/another-place\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Proxy project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/another_place_logo_process.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Another Place by Proxy\" \/>\n<figcaption>Process.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/another_place_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Another Place by Proxy\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/another_place_logo_crop.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Another Place by Proxy\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo crop.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo had a <em>Lost in Space<\/em> vibe that was charming in a 1960s, space-awe, vintage-ness but it was too literal in representing the name: another place visualized as a planet in outer space. The main problem is that their games don&#8217;t take place in outer space which would be an expectation set by the old logo which is one of the main reasons I like the new one&#8230; that it&#8217;s a more ambiguous, open-for-interpretation of the name. It now has more of a comic book flavor &#8212; which may also not be exactly right for the two games &#8212; but it does cast a broader net. Visually, I love it. The typography has great dimension and the &#8220;long shadow&#8221; or, I guess, &#8220;long beam of light&#8221; is very well done for a visual trick that can turn out bad very easily, especially with so many characters that, in this case, also happen to sit on a curve, at an angle, and with perspective.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/another_place_guidelines.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Another Place by Proxy\" \/>\n<figcaption>Guidelines.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/another_place_business_cards_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Another Place by Proxy\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/another_place_business_cards_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Another Place by Proxy\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/another_place_ad.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Another Place by Proxy\" \/>\n<figcaption>Ad.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/another_place_web_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Another Place by Proxy\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/another_place_web_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Another Place by Proxy\" \/>\n<figcaption>Website.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/another_place_characters.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Another Place by Proxy\" \/>\n<figcaption>Characters interacting with the logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/another_place_tote.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Another Place by Proxy\" \/>\n<figcaption>Tote.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/another_place_tee.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Another Place by Proxy\" \/>\n<figcaption>Tee.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/another_place_logo_wall.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Another Place by Proxy\" \/>\n<figcaption>Wall.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">In application, it&#8217;s mostly a repetition of the logo, in particular the crop of the logo that establishes large fields of color and when it scales dramatically it creates cool abstract shapes for the characters to interact with. Overall, I&#8217;m mostly a big fan of the new logo and its strength alone carries the identity with the support of the rich characters. It&#8217;s also nice to see a game developer with a logo that isn&#8217;t all bevels, shadows, and overly dramatic animations.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Prelude: Thank you all for your patience these last three weeks with the lack of regular content on Brand New as the conference took over our schedule.
