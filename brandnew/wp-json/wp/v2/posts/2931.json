Old-fashioned but it did the job. The new logo takes on a more minimal flavor and provides a bolder device to brand the packaging. It&#8217;s simple and much easier to reproduce than the previous logo and it sets up the elements of the packaging quite well.<\/p>\n<blockquote>The visual artistry on the new packaging tells stories of Minnesota landmarks and the ingredients that make each brew uniquely Summit. The final product illustrates the brand&#8217;s evolution while celebrating the place it calls home.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.summitbrewing.com\/new-look-for-Summit-Brewing-Company-in-2014\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press release<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/summit_03_SMT_New_Bottles.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for Summit Brewing Company by Duffy &amp; Partners\" \/>\n<figcaption>New, year-round bottles.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/summit_04_SMT_BottleLineup_Seasonal.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for Summit Brewing Company by Duffy &amp; Partners\" \/>\n<figcaption>New, seasonal bottles.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/summit_05_SMT_BottleCrowns.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for Summit Brewing Company by Duffy &amp; Partners\" \/>\n<figcaption>Crowns.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/summit_06_SMT_6packs_1.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for Summit Brewing Company by Duffy &amp; Partners\" \/>\n<figcaption>6-packs.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/summit_10_SMT_Cases.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for Summit Brewing Company by Duffy &amp; Partners\" \/>\n<figcaption>Cases.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/summit_09_SMT_RED_Group.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for Summit Brewing Company by Duffy &amp; Partners\" \/>\n<figcaption>A couple of group shots.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/summit_15_SMT_LiquorBoy_Horiz.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for Summit Brewing Company by Duffy &amp; Partners\" \/>\n<figcaption>Banner at the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.liquor-boy.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Liquor Boy<\/a> store in St. Louis Park, MN.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/summit_16_SMT_Brochure.jpg\" alt=\"New Packaging for Summit Brewing Company by Duffy &amp; Partners\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brochure.

The landmark illustrations also provide an interesting urban feel to the packaging as opposed to the more usual rural allusions of fields of wheat and barley. Plus, they have their own cribbage board.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1986, Summit Brewing Company is a premium craft brewery in St. Paul, Minnesota with a range of 13 varieties of beer that include seven year-round options, four seasonal beers, and a couple of special series.
