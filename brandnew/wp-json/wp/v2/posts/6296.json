For more than 80 years, we&#8217;ve been reimagining the experience of flight &#8211; and where it can take us. We are pioneers. We were the first to break the sound barrier and to certify a commercial helicopter. We were aboard NASA&#8217;s first lunar mission and brought advanced tiltrotor systems to market. And today, we&#8217;re defining the future of on demand mobility. Just last month, we were the first aeronautical company to debut at CES, demonstrating our urban air taxi concept aircraft&#8211;an innovation closer to reality than science fiction. Headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas &#8211; as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Textron Inc., &#8211; we have strategic locations around the globe. With nearly one quarter of our workforce having served, helping our military achieve their missions is a passion of ours. Above all, our breakthrough innovations deliver exceptional experiences to our customers. Efficiently. Reliably. And always, with safety at the forefront.&#8221;<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bell_helicopter_follow_up_logo_inspiration.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Logo and Identity for Bell by Futurebrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo and references.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bell_helicopter_follow_up_logo.png\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Logo and Identity for Bell by Futurebrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bell_helicopter_follow_up_identity_elements.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Logo and Identity for Bell by Futurebrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Identity elements.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bell_helicopter_follow_up_layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Logo and Identity for Bell by Futurebrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Layouts.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bell_helicopter_follow_up_spaceship.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Logo and Identity for Bell by Futurebrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Spaceship vehicle thing that&#8217;s awesome.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bell_helicopter_follow_up_ads.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Logo and Identity for Bell by Futurebrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Ads.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bell_helicopter_follow_up_swag.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Logo and Identity for Bell by Futurebrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Swag.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bell_helicopter_follow_up_badges.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Logo and Identity for Bell by Futurebrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Name badges.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/258062816?title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"940\" height=\"529\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Motion toolkit.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/258062934?title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"940\" height=\"529\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Brand video.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"(Est. 1935) &quot;Thinking above and beyond is what [Bell does].
