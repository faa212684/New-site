The latest fiasco comes courtesy of the student body of the <a href=\"http:\/\/uwaterloo.ca\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">University of Waterloo<\/a> in Ontario, Canada, a well regarded and large university.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/uni_of_waterloo_banner.gif\" alt=\"University of Waterloo, Banner\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This past Monday, banners, like the one above, started propping up on campus in preparation for a student and parent visit. This was the first public indication that change was coming. The previous week, a memo titled &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bulletin.uwaterloo.ca\/2009\/jul\/16th.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How to better tell the Waterloo story<\/a>&#8221; began seeding the fact that the university was about to undergo serious change to modify the institution&#8217;s perception.<\/p>\n<blockquote>In a recent national reputational survey, we learned that respondents see Waterloo as a regional university and very few people outside Ontario were even aware of Waterloo&#8217;s reputation or what sets us apart from other schools. Although we &#8220;owned&#8221; the innovation- and industry-connected categories, we were not known for specific strengths.<br \/><br \/>Over the past year, these teams have developed a positioning framework, which includes our vision, values, positioning attributes, and our promise &#8211; &#8220;building the future through innovation and experience.&#8221; They have also worked on a new identity to visually present Waterloo and a roll-out process and schedule for the new positioning and identity framework.<br \/><br \/>In late July, we will mount updated street pole banners reflecting the spirit of the new marketing-oriented visual identity for Waterloo. You will see new colours that will be associated with each faculty and bolder use of line, character font, and colour.<\/blockquote>\n<p>The memo further describes how decisions were made and what committees made them. Which is all a nice way to keep people abreast of what is going on, rather than just springing a new identity on the unsuspecting faculty and students. But that didn&#8217;t matter. Somehow, this past Wednesday, the new logo was leaked. And people freaked the hell out. How many people and how freaked out you ask? <a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/group.php?gid=123891536822\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A Facebook group with 5,530 members<\/a> as of this writing opposes the logo with knowledgeable and mature comments like &#8220;Yay for 12-year-old graphic designers!,&#8221; &#8220;my 12 year old sister could have designed a better logo using Paint,&#8221; &#8220;OMG LAZERS!!,&#8221; and &#8220;welcome to WacDonald&#8217;s can I get your order please?&#8221; There are more than 40 pages worth of comments.<\/p>\n<p>The main complaint throughout is that the new logo is not dignified enough and it does not represent the school. But somehow, a crest, like thousands of other crests &mdash; who the majority of people don&#8217;t know what they stand for anyway &mdash; does. Unfortunately this is antiquated thinking. Universities can not get by with traditional crests in today&#8217;s &uuml;ber branded environment and, if you look around, most large universities operate with a &#8220;marketing&#8221; logo and use a traditional seal for boring things like diplomas or the back covers of their catalogues.<\/p>\n<p>The new logo for University of Waterloo is actually an extreme, I will grant the whining Facebookers that. It&#8217;s not a comfortable logo to look at and it&#8217;s unclear what all those lines mean or are meant to do. Unfortunately, they don&#8217;t do much other than distract. But, in application this logo and its extended identity could be very interesting. However, this post and the controversy around it doesn&#8217;t have as much to do with whether the logo is good or bad &mdash; it&#8217;s neither really &mdash; but the propensity of students and faculty to cry foul with any change that has been carried out thoroughly by a range of committees. If they respect their university and its values they need to trust their leadership. Not whine about how 12-year-olds could do a better logo. Because they can&#8217;t.<\/p>\n<p>Dear Waterloo-people-in-charge: Stick to your plan. Don&#8217;t succumb.<\/p>\n<h4>Thanks to Brandon Walkin for first tip.<br \/><br \/><\/h4>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_20090724_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_20090724_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_20090724_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_20090724_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,29,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/887"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=887"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/887\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=887"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=887"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=887"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
