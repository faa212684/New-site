Kraft and Procter &amp; Gamble are probably the first that come to mind, but even those two don&#8217;t seem to have the amount of popular brands run by ConAgra Foods. And it&#8217;s this sense of lack of recognition that drove the impetus for a new identity as ConAgra Foods moves from being a behind-the-scenes holding company to a more public-facing operating company.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>The new identity was created after research with multiple stakeholder groups, including customers, revealed lack of association between ConAgra Foods and its popular brands. The logo itself features a new, more contemporary color palette along with a &#8216;spoon in plate&#8217; icon designed to reinforce the company&#8217;s position as a leading food company. The tagline, &#8220;Food you love&#8221; reinforces the individual company brands that consumers love.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/media.conagrafoods.com\/phoenix.zhtml?c=202310&#038;p=irol-newsArticle&#038;ID=1289417&#038;highlight=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press Release<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/conagra_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"ConagraFoods Logo, Detail\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Logo configurations.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The new icon is pretty cute and clever-ish. There are a number of things you can read into it: A wink, a fruit, a smile, a plate, a cyclops, etc. But the main point is that it is unique and memorable for them, specially in an industry that is downright serious with their logos&hellip; well, there <em>is<\/em> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kraft_smiling_at_you.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kraft&#8217;s silliness of a logo<\/a>. The typography is where things start to cross the line into weird territory, mainly with the leafy &#8220;r,&#8221; which I think is an unnecessary flourish that only adds some noise as the logo gets smaller. But, hey, at least for all you Gotham haters out there, it&#8217;s not Gotham. Or Avenir.
