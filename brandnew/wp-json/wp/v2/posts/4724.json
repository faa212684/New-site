The new logo fixes that very efficiently with a few quick cues: a fancy monogram, all uppercase wordmark, and a deep green color that make it unmistakably financial. (It also says &#8220;BANK&#8221; big in the name so that helps too.)<\/p>\n<p>The new monogram is an ambigram &#8212; readable at 0 and 180 degrees &#8212; that spells EPB. The &#8220;P&#8221; gets a little squeezed and starts to look like an &#8220;L&#8221; but the overall effect feels luxurious, personalized, and as if it has been this way for centuries (a la GE). The wordmark with the chiseled serifs is strong and elegant without feeling stuffy and maintains the cool &#8220;K&#8221; standard with a slightly stenciled new &#8220;K&#8221;.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/erik_penser_bank_icons.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Erik Penser Bank by Bedow\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/erik_penser_bank_icons_animated.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Erik Penser Bank by Bedow\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icons.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Pretty icons but maybe too playful for the rest of the identity.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/erik_penser_bank_business_card.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Erik Penser Bank by Bedow\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business card.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/erik_penser_bank_folder.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Erik Penser Bank by Bedow\" \/>\n<figcaption>Folder.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/erik_penser_bank_forms.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Erik Penser Bank by Bedow\" \/>\n<figcaption>Forms.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/erik_penser_bank_place_setting.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Erik Penser Bank by Bedow\" \/>\n<figcaption>Place setting.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">In application, the identity is so bank-esque that you can basically see the interest accruing right in front of you. I love that it&#8217;s a bank-bank aesthetic. It doesn&#8217;t try to be friendly, accessible, or contemporary&#8230; it wants its customers to feel like their money is in the right place. That form looks so good I want to fill it right now.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1994, Erik Penser Bank is a privately owned and independent bank in Sweden that provides a range of financial services to private and institutional investors, including wealth management investments and advisory on IPO and other corporate financing.
