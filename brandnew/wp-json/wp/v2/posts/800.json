And every time, you know, I watch the video, it gets me certainly emotional about, builds my passion for this province,&#8221; [Alberta Premier Ed] Stelmach said Wednesday.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/canada\/calgary\/story\/2009\/03\/25\/cgy-alberta-new-slogan-logo.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CBC News<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p>The new identity and branding initiative will cost taxpayers $25 million over the course of three years as Alberta goes on a branding offensive, building on five months worth of quantitative and qualitative <a href=\"http:\/\/www.albertabrand.com\/showcasingalberta\/research.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">research<\/a>. As far as the logo is concerned, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.albertabrand.com\/showcasingalberta\/describingthebrand.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here is what we know<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote>Alberta&#8217;s new logo has been developed to speak to the freedom to create and the spirit to achieve. Such a promise calls for a unique logo approach. It requires a signature that measures up to the Albertan attitude: open, aspirational, strong, dynamic, and genuine. The essence of people realizing possibilities inspires a signature with personality:<br \/><br \/>&bull; The line weight is strong.<br \/>&bull; The flow and movement in the writing style is dynamic.<br \/>&bull; The openness of the letters is inviting and the treatment alludes to our mountains and our prairies.<br \/>&bull; The handwriting implies that Albertans are creating and endorsing this brand, this province.<\/blockquote>\n<p>It&#8217;s actually not bad. My favorite part of the logo is how the &#8220;A&#8221; mimics the shape of the previous logo, making it evident that someone was paying attention. My least favorite part, however, is the square at the tail-end of the &#8220;a.&#8221; It serves no purpose and clashes with the free-flow of the script lettering. If it had somehow translated as a visual element in the application in other materials, maybe, but I didn&#8217;t see it do anything. So, if I kind of wish away that little square, this is a very satisfying design, being extremely fresh and sort of liberating. The old logo, which I had not seen before, is quite awesome and would probably sell like crazy on a ringer tee at Urban Outfitters.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.steveross.ca\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Steve Ross<\/a> for first tip.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,64,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/800"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=800"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/800\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=800"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=800"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=800"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
