Founded in 1934 by Sir James Wattie, the company operated in New Zealand under the name of J. Wattie Canneries Limited (later J Wattie Foods Limited and its related companies). In 1980, Wattie Industries and Goodman Fielder purchased shares in each other&#8217;s companies that led to a merger in 1987 to create Goodman Fielder Wattie Ltd. In 1992 the Wattie&#8217;s group was bought from Goodman Fielder by American-based H. J. Heinz Company for $565 million. The company employs around 1,900 people, of which approximately 350 are temporary or casual. The company produces its own Wattie&#8217;s products, some international brands of H. J. Heinz Company, as well as local products under brands like Craig&#8217;s, Farex, Eta, Oak, Good Taste Company, Greenseas, Earth&#8217;s Best, Complan, Chef and Champ.&#8221; (<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wattie's\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wikipedia<\/a>)<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/watties_logo_evolution.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Wattie&amp;apos;s by Unified Brands\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo evolution.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/watties_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Wattie&amp;apos;s by Unified Brands\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/watties_packaging_old_a.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Wattie&amp;apos;s by Unified Brands\" \/>\n<figcaption>Samples of tomato sauce old packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/watties_packaging_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Wattie&amp;apos;s by Unified Brands\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/watties_packaging_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Wattie&amp;apos;s by Unified Brands\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/watties_packaging_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Wattie&amp;apos;s by Unified Brands\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/watties_packaging_04.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Wattie&amp;apos;s by Unified Brands\" \/>\n<figcaption>Packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"(Est. 1934) &quot;Wattie&apos;s is an American-owned [HJ Heinz group] food producer of frozen and packaged fruit, vegetables, sauces, baby food, cooking sauces, dressings and pet foods in the New Zealand market.
