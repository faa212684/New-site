Currently undergoing a &pound;20.5 million renovation aimed to open in 2010 and, leading up to that moment, the museum has begun phasing a new identity that will brand the main museum, as well as two related institutions, the Museum of London Docklands and the Museum of London Archaeology. The new look has been designed by London-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cpb.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Coley Porter Bell<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>The striking new logo, designed by award winning agency Coley Porter Bell, takes the conceptual form of London&#8217;s thumbprint. Coloured layers map the shape of London over time, reflecting the ever-changing, diverse and dynamic make up of London and Londoners, past, present and future. The brand mark has been crafted to create visual impact, and link the Museum venues.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.museumoflondon.org.uk\/English\/AboutUs\/Newsroom\/Current\/Museum+of+London+Takes+on+a+New+Identity.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press release<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/museum_of_london_sub.gif\" alt=\"Museum of London Docklands and Archaelogy Logos\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Even though the shapes being so organic make the institutions look more like natural history museums, I really like the idea of using the growing geographic area of London as a way to represent the content and mission of the museum and I think the execution verges on good with the possibility of crossing over to clunky. The typography is simple and confident but the placement feels too forced and obstructing, but nothing too offensive. The sub-brands are also properly done, although the way they barely touch the blobs is neither here nor there. Overall, I think the complaints do not outweigh the overall concept, and from the look of the web site and even the favicon, it looks like this identity can be applied and extended in interesting ways.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.johnsonbanks.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Michael Johnson<\/a> for the tip.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,63,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/717"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=717"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/717\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=717"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=717"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=717"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
