The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.filmfestivalrotterdam.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">International Film Festival Rotterdam<\/a> (IFFR), running since 1972 and handing prizes since 1995 is one of the top festivals but, unfortunately, you might never know that from their old logo.<\/p><!--more--><p>Designed by one of my favorite designer\/illustrators, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.maxkisman.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Max Kisman<\/a>, the old logo was a little too quirky in its typography and too cartoony in the depiction of the festival&#8217;s tiger mascot. The new logo and identity, designed by Rotterdam based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.75b.nl\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">75b<\/a>, is the complete opposite. And I really like it. Typography aside, which I think is perfectly neutral, the tiger icon is downright lovely. The uniformity of the line width and simplicity of the elements makes for a very fetching, memorable and unique identity.
