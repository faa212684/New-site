This week, Scotiabank introduced a new identity.

While used as the social media avatar, it is nowhere to be found on their website. When I think of Scotiabank the first thing that pops into my head is the S-Globe thing so it&#8217;s weird that they would not just separate it but make it a supporting element, especially to yet another generic, geometric sans &#8212; which is fine and all but at this point all these geometric sans serif logos are like trying to tell one egg from another. Having said that, the wordmark evolution is better than the icon evolution, which lost the depiction of the globe in exchange for a giant dot that looks like a D-list superhero icon now. I imagine one of the reason for this change is that the lines in the old globe were being problematic when shrunk but I&#8217;m sure a middle ground could have been reached to keep the globe, which is far more interesting than the dot and far more memorable than the bank&#8217;s name in a geometric sans.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/scotiabank_font_01.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Scotiabank\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/scotiabank_font_02.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Scotiabank\" \/>\n<figcaption>Custom font.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Doesn&#8217;t this font already exist a dozen times?

The illustrations are a little awkward and feel rushed but they are colorful, for sure. The photography is a little clich\u00e9d and super forced to show emotions but they are colorful, for sure. And the hues they are many so they are colorful, for sure. Despite the slight sarcasm, this is all fine. There is definitely a superficial vibrancy to the elements and applications. The few examples shown feel a bit flat but the messages pop and the logo pops &#8212; not terribly insightful or inspiring but it gets the job done. The loose use of &#8220;Scotia&#8221; vs. &#8220;Scotiabank&#8221; seems like it could cause trouble, the same way &#8220;Citi&#8221; and &#8220;Citibank&#8221; have co-existed confusingly for so many years.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/V8W9AtL8qL8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>New look introduction.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">Overall, a fairly safe update that appears to aim to please as many people as possible &#8212; although I&#8217;m not sure how this works for more corporate clients &#8212; and to simplify its logo for digital use but, in the process, has lost what made it distinct.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1832, Scotiabank (formally The Bank of Nova Scotia) is one of the largest banks and financial services provider in Canada.
