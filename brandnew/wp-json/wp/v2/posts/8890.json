To be perfectly honest I am not 100% clear about what they do but I think I get it: They build the things that allow people that build bigger things to build in systems that are constantly testing and monitoring those things with the things in the things. Clearer, right? Based in Austin, TX, NI has over 7,300 employees and works with more than 35,000 customer accounts worldwide. Earlier this month, as part of a repositioning to &#8220;speak to the needs of larger enterprises while remaining true to the community of passionate and brilliant engineers&#8221;, NI introduced a new identity designed by New York, NY-based <a href=\"https:\/\/gretelny.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gretel<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ni_followup_logo_before_after.png\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Logo and Identity for NI by Gretel\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo, before and after.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The mark reflects the connection of hard and soft, rationality and creativity, tech and people that sets NI apart. The letterforms are modular, geometric and precise.

Long-winded way of saying, the logo is fine but it&#8217;s finer in application on a system that emphasizes the curves and hard edges found in the logo.<\/p>\n<blockquote>In a category oversaturated with safety blue and electric red, NI stands apart. The green signals a decisive new direction for the brand and evokes feelings of growth, change and sustainability, one of the grand challenges facing engineering today.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/gretelny.com\/ni-engineer-ambitiously\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gretel project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ni_followup_color_palette.png\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Logo and Identity for NI by Gretel\" \/>\n<figcaption>Color palette.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>A suite of complementary typefaces extends the core brand idea of balancing precision and personality.

For now, this is another great example of how to do it right. The color palette is strong and I enjoy the combination of greens. The photography is solid and the illustrations are exciting, although perhaps they stand out a little too much.<\/p>\n<blockquote>The elements work together through a modular system that allows the grid to flex depending on the message and content. In stark contrast to the category, the design language maintains an editorial feel, and photography plays a key role by featuring the people, partners and impact of the innovations powered by NI, not just the products.<br \/><br \/>Moving beyond the tropes and traditions of the B2B test and measurement category meant approaching the brand like a dynamic B2C.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/gretelny.com\/ni-engineer-ambitiously\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gretel project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ni_followup_brand_manual_covers.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Logo and Identity for NI by Gretel\" \/>\n<figcaption>Identity guidelines covers.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ni_followup_business_cards.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Logo and Identity for NI by Gretel\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ni_followup_software_manual_covers.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Logo and Identity for NI by Gretel\" \/>\n<figcaption>Software manual covers.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ni_followup_magazine_ad.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Logo and Identity for NI by Gretel\" \/>\n<figcaption>Print ad.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/429430784?title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0&#038;autoplay=1&#038;loop=1&#038;autopause=0&#038;background=1&#038;muted=1\" width=\"360\" height=\"203\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Digital ad.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/429476911?title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0&#038;autoplay=1&#038;loop=1&#038;autopause=0&#038;background=1&#038;muted=1\" width=\"360\" height=\"203\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Website, design and development by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.organic.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Organic<\/a>.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\" style=\"background:#084a29\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/430041035?title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0&#038;autoplay=1&#038;loop=1&#038;autopause=0&#038;background=1&#038;muted=1\" width=\"360\" height=\"203\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Online journal.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ni_followup_email.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Logo and Identity for NI by Gretel\" \/>\n<figcaption>Email header.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ni_followup_instagram.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Logo and Identity for NI by Gretel\" \/>\n<figcaption>Instagram post.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\" style=\"padding-bottom: 35.25%;\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/430507989?title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"360\" height=\"203\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Trade show graphics.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ni_followup_posters.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Logo and Identity for NI by Gretel\" \/>\n<figcaption>Posters.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ni_followup_billboard.jpg\" alt=\"Follow-up: New Logo and Identity for NI by Gretel\" \/>\n<figcaption>Billboard.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>In application, all the elements come together very convincingly in fairly straightforward layouts that benefit from the well-chosen ingredients.
