It technically opened in 1892 but its story goes back 36 years when a Moscow merchant, Pavel Mikhailovich Tretyakov, began collecting Russian paintings and then commissioning them, ultimately donating over 2,000 pieces to establish the gallery. Over the years, the gallery has established sister museums across Moscow, most notably a building dedicated to twentieth-century art, and a range of historical sites. Recently, Tretyakov Gallery introduced a new identity designed by Moscow-based <a href=\"https:\/\/en.ony.ru\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ONY<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>Today the gallery develops, it becomes closer to the people, from the format of the classical museum is transformed into a modern, relevant space filled with a diverse array of activities. To develop the image, which will unite the entire museum complex, its projects and activities, needed a universal sign. It could not be entirely new, but it had to look modern, in addition, it was to be understandable to foreign audiences.<br \/><br \/>The basis of the decision lay down a living letter &#8220;T&#8221;, shifts the focus on people and the ability to transform into a variety of images and objects. The new &#8220;T&#8221; combines the tradition of the Cyrillic alphabet and the Russian avant-garde aesthetics. The letter fits in the modern digital world and understood in many languages. The sign is the basis for flexible visual system &#8211; is not just a letter, and a window into the world of Russian art. In it there are paintings, sculptures, installations, people.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/en.ony.ru\/t-brand\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ONY project page (Google-translated)<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tretyakov_logo_english.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Tretyakov Gallery by ONY\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tretyakov_logo_russian_a.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Tretyakov Gallery by ONY\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo in English and Russian.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tretyakov_t_with_people.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo with people.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tretyakov_logo_dept_variations.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Tretyakov Gallery by ONY\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logos for the different locations and smaller museums.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo was fine&#8230; a typical depiction of the museum&#8217;s building with decent type. Not very exciting or interpretative and it got the job done but it was unable to encompass all of the extensions from the main gallery location. The new logo features a &#8220;T&#8221; in an abstract style that looks both classic and contemporary and has been designed to be flexible in what it shows in the stem, either serving as a window to place imagery or as a placeholder for any other vertical shapes, like humans. Keeping the triangles of the crossbar, maintains a consistent visual element as the stem changes, which is what gives this a slightly novel twist from the usual logo-as-window approach. The wordmark in the geometric sans serif isn&#8217;t quite right; I think the serif chosen for the identity (shown below) would have yielded a better combination of new and old between monogram and wordmark.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tretyakov_typography.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Tretyakov Gallery by ONY\" \/>\n<figcaption>Typography.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tretyakov_tickets.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Tretyakov Gallery by ONY\" \/>\n<figcaption>Tickets.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tretyakov_brochures.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Tretyakov Gallery by ONY\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tretyakov_brochures_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Tretyakov Gallery by ONY\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brochures.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tretyakov_posters_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Tretyakov Gallery by ONY\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tretyakov_posters_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Tretyakov Gallery by ONY\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tretyakov_posters_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Tretyakov Gallery by ONY\" \/>\n<figcaption>Poster.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tretyakov_diagonal_things_a.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Tretyakov Gallery by ONY\" \/>\n<figcaption>Long things.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tretyakov_banner_schedules.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Tretyakov Gallery by ONY\" \/>\n<figcaption>Programming posters.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/210926192?color=c5b29a&#038;title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<hr \/>\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/210926183?color=c5b29a&#038;title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Digital outdoor ads.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tretyakov_tote.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Tretyakov Gallery by ONY\" \/>\n<figcaption>Tote.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The applications are quite elegant and very nicely laid out with a large &#8220;T&#8221; punctuating each one.
