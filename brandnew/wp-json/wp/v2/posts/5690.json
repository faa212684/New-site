Their signature offering, called Cid, is available in four varieties and is sold throughout Quebec, Spain, and parts of the U.S.. Earlier this year, with the name change, Cidrerie Milton introduced a new identity for the company and new packaging for Cid designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/lg2.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">lg2<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>For the cider maker&#8217;s new identity, the creative team chose colours inspired by the cider maker&#8217;s heritage and the raw material itself &#8211; green &#8211; and its boldness &#8211; a bright, solid orange. The objective was to equip the company, who is a leader in Qu\u00e9bec&#8217;s cider industry, with the winning conditions to catch the consumer&#8217;s eye with a distinctive and easily recognizable brand and products.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/lg2.com\/en\/work\/848\/cidrery-milton-visual-identity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">lg2 project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cidrerie_milton_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Cidrerie Milton by lg2\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo was very awkward, with a weirdly drawn apple that had a floating stem and some kind of revolution-communism-power-to-the-apples star in the center holding odd-shaped seeds. The small condensed wordmark underneath had no visual relation to the apple and it didn&#8217;t quite match with their cute, provincial, rustic <a href=\"http:\/\/cidreriemilton.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/contacte-nous-coordonnees-a-modifier-compressor.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">headquarters<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The new logo foregoes any apple depiction since now the name &#8212; Milton Cidery &#8212; communicates that this has to do with apples and while the new logo says nothing specifically about apples or ciders it&#8217;s damn pretty and positioned more like a winery than a produce provider. The wordmark is typeset in a customized version of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.myfonts.com\/fonts\/type-type\/tt-drugs-condensed\/?refby=ucllc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TT Drugs Condensed<\/a> &#8212; odd name, I know &#8212; that is also used as the main identity typeface. The logo is not the most original or interesting but it certainly establishes an elegant, high-end mood.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cidrerie_milton_stationery.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Cidrerie Milton by lg2\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stationery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cidrerie_milton_tote.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Cidrerie Milton by lg2\" \/>\n<figcaption>Tote.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cidrerie_milton_print_materials.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Cidrerie Milton by lg2\" \/>\n<figcaption>A few more materials.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The applications, in a fresh combination of dark green and orange, are all beautifully designed with a great balance of big typography, rustic photography, and a nice accent in the round seal.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cidrerie_milton_old_cid.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Cidrerie Milton by lg2\" \/>\n<figcaption>Old Cid packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>&#8220;For Cid, we created a style that manages to be both classic and fun.

The kegs were almost more like car oil packaging. The new bottles represent exactly the kind of lightness and fun-ness I was mentioning&#8230; perhaps now turned up to 11 with the introduction of a range of illustrations showing animals doing unexpected things and with apples around them. I don&#8217;t know what they have to do with anything but they certainly stand out. The new &#8220;Cid&#8221; script logo is okay, perhaps a little clunky, but it pairs nicely with the illustrations. I&#8217;m not sure the serif typography for the varieties is quite right but its thick-thin contrast provides a good balance with the illustrations. The orange label on the neck and the orange cap are the perfect accents. The one aspect where they get an F is in the Cuivr\u00e9 variety where the illustration has simply been inverted so what are meant to be shadows are rendered as white, which is a no-no.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/cidrerie_milton_packaging_4packs.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Cidrerie Milton by lg2\" \/>\n<figcaption>4-packs.
