Originally produced by hand and sold at $1 a piece &#8212; a day&#8217;s wages at that time &#8212; the company introduced automated production in 1896 with the help of none other than Henry Ford and since then have been producing high-quality watches used and praised by many, including notable individuals like U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt and Mahatma Gandhi. In the 1930s they worked with Disney to create <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ebay.com\/b\/Ingersoll-Disney-Watches-Timepieces-Pre-1968\/1399\/bn_57667372\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the iconic Mickey Mouse watch<\/a> where his hands tell the time and by 1957 they had made 25 million of them. Passing through a number of owners over the years, the Ingersoll brand is currently owned by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.heraldgroup.com.hk\/timepieces.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Zeon Watches<\/a>, a British subsidiary of the Chinese company Herald Group, and distributed in more than 50 countries. At this year&#8217;s Baselworld watch Fair, Ingersoll introduced a new identity designed by London, UK-based <a href=\"https:\/\/anewkindofkick.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A New Kind Of Kick<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>A New Kind Of Kick gave the traditional watch brand a new sense of direction and a new lease of life, as a result of re-examining their forgotten history, from this &#8216;The True Original&#8217; was reborn. Our challenge was to put style and meaning back into a historic brand that had lost its foundations. To discover their magic and form the thread that would run through every touch point.<br \/><br \/>Tweaking the existing logo to include the brands founding date further cements the companies history. Also incorporating the original founders signature into much of brands print and packaging.<\/blockquote><h3>A New Kind Of Kick provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ingersoll_logo_before_after.png\" alt=\"New Identity for Ingersoll by A New Kind of Kick\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo, before and after.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ingersoll_logo.png\" alt=\"New Identity for Ingersoll by A New Kind of Kick\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>It&#8217;s unfortunate that the logo didn&#8217;t change at all. It was prime for a redrawing by expert hands &#8212; paging Dr. <a href=\"https:\/\/robclarke.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rob Clarke<\/a> &#8212; and would have catapulted this new identity to even greater results. We&#8217;ll have to assume that a proper logo redesign was a non-starter with the client in which case, yeah, the bigger and more separated &#8220;1892&#8221; is a big improvement as is the move away from red. The addition of the signature as an identity element is good because pretty much any company with origins beyond the 1900s <em>must<\/em> use its founder&#8217;s signature as an identity element &#8212; I acknowledge this sounds like a little bit of sarcasm but people back then did have kick-ass signatures that look great today.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ingersoll_signature.png\" alt=\"New Identity for Ingersoll by A New Kind of Kick\" \/>\n<figcaption>Signature.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ingersoll_print_various.jpg\" alt=\"New Identity for Ingersoll by A New Kind of Kick\" \/>\n<figcaption>Various print applications.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ingersoll_packaging.jpg\" alt=\"New Identity for Ingersoll by A New Kind of Kick\" \/>\n<figcaption>Packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ingersoll_booklet_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Identity for Ingersoll by A New Kind of Kick\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ingersoll_booklet_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Identity for Ingersoll by A New Kind of Kick\" \/>\n<figcaption>Booklet.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The few applications shown are quite nice. There is nothing revolutionary about them and, in a way, they sort of <em>not<\/em> stand out but everything is very well designed, made, and presented.

The laborious process of exposing photosensitive tin plates links back to the birth date of Ingersoll and our proposition &#8216;A True Original&#8217;.

Taking direct inspiration from late 19th century American dry goods stores from the time of the brands original inception. We juxtaposed this with modern luxury features bringing the brand to life for a contemporary audience. Standout features included a wall of boxes, lead-lined windows and vintage haberdashery cabinets.<\/blockquote><h3>A New Kind Of Kick provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ingersoll_vintage_photos.jpg\" alt=\"New Identity for Ingersoll by A New Kind of Kick\" \/>\n<figcaption>Photos of Ingersoll from the 1890s to the 1940s.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ingersoll_baselworld_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Identity for Ingersoll by A New Kind of Kick\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ingersoll_baselworld_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Identity for Ingersoll by A New Kind of Kick\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ingersoll_baselworld_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Identity for Ingersoll by A New Kind of Kick\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ingersoll_baselworld_04.jpg\" alt=\"New Identity for Ingersoll by A New Kind of Kick\" \/>\n<figcaption>Baselworld exhibit.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The highlight of the project is the exhibit at the watch fair that takes direct cues from images of the early days of Ingersoll reinvented with a contemporary, elegant flair.
