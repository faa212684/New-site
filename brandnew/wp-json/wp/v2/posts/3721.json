The organization lobbies for the role of the autonomous midwife and aims to &#8220;safeguard authentic midwifery both in and out of the [National Health Service]&#8221; as the IMUK feels the profession is under constant threat. Last week, IMUK introduced a new identity designed by London-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nalla.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nalla<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>Nalla&#8217;s rebrand of IMUK has looked at the fundamentals of what midwives do; using their hands to feel how a baby is positioned, and to bring life into the world. &#8220;Many midwives fondly refer to their job as &#8216;baby catching&#8217;,&#8221; said Lead Designer on the project Alice Saunders, &#8220;so the use of a hand as the main graphic element seemed fitting. It represents the continual support that midwives give &mdash; they are there for the entire journey.&#8221;<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nalla.co.uk\/projects\/independent_midwives\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nalla project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/imuk_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Independent Midwives UK by Nalla\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/imuk_logo_detail_full.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Independent Midwives UK by Nalla\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo with tagline.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo was fairly prescriptive by showing three midwives holding a baby, inside a heart. Pretty clear message. Pretty bland too. The new logo, I&#8217;ll be the first to admit, could be absolutely for any kind of organization, be it midwifery, yogurt, or yoga pants. It&#8217;s even more broad when reduced to the IMUK acronym. So the logo &mdash; which itself I really like as a piece of lettering &mdash; is only as successful as the organization is known by the public. To that I can&#8217;t speak of, so we will assume IMUK feels confident enough that its logo can stand on its own like that. I do like the concept of the logo being hand-drawn as en extension of the midwives&#8217; relation to tact. It&#8217;s only in application when the logo starts to take on a &#8220;family&#8221; meaning, thanks to some warm-hearted illustrations and photography.<\/p>\n<blockquote>The new branding celebrates the continuity of care offered by an independent midwife, as she guides a woman through her birth journey (from pregnancy, through birth and into the post-natal period). This journey is represented by a series of hand-drawn illustrations using a continuous line.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nalla.co.uk\/projects\/independent_midwives\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nalla project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/imuk_illustrations_midwifery.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Independent Midwives UK by Nalla\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/imuk_illustrations_family.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Independent Midwives UK by Nalla\" \/>\n<figcaption>Illustrations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/imuk_stationery.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Independent Midwives UK by Nalla\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stationery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/imuk_tshirt.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Independent Midwives UK by Nalla\" \/>\n<figcaption>T-shirt.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/imuk_various_materials.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Independent Midwives UK by Nalla\" \/>\n<figcaption>Various materials.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/imuk_members_handbook.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Independent Midwives UK by Nalla\" \/>\n<figcaption>Members&#8217; handbook.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/imuk_ad.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Independent Midwives UK by Nalla\" \/>\n<figcaption>Ad.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/imuk_baby_soap.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Independent Midwives UK by Nalla\" \/>\n<figcaption>Baby in bubbles.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">In application, the identity is warm and cozy with the purple and orange color palette and hand-drawn line illustrations. I think it could use some more clear presentation of the full name in certain applications so that a broader range of people will recognize what this is for. They could also just use the picture directly above of the baby in bubbles for everything, and it would simply be the best thing ever. Unless you hate babies. Or bubbles. Or both.
