Anderson Design many years ago squarely in the rear-view mirror. The pastel color palette brings a bit of that patina from early color movies while the introduction of expressive brush lettering adds a touch of newness. I&#8217;m not a big fan of the DIN-esque typography chosen to carry the identity &mdash; it feels too distant and cold, like it&#8217;s not properly engaging with the content. My favorite, subtle detail of the whole package is when the logo &#8220;drops&#8221; from the center of the screen and becomes blurry, giving it a lens-like effect. Overall, there is a few too many elements at play and it doesn&#8217;t seem like they quite come together perfectly yet, but I definitely like where the brush lettering and color palette could take this and now that AMC (American Movie Classics) is focused on original content, this is a great time for TMC to establish its niche and this definitely gives it its own aesthetic.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Launched in 1994, Turner Classic Movies (TCM) presents, as its name implies, some of the most classic and great American films &mdash; mostly from the 1930s through the 1960s &mdash; that every movie lover should watch.
