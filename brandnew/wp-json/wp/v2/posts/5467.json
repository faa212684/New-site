Recently, IBM has redesigned Watson&#8217;s identity in-house led by ex-Wolff Olins Todd Simmons, now VP, IBM Brand Experience &amp; Design, in collaboration with Athletics, Atlason, Universal Everything, ManvsMachine, and Ogilvy.<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ibm_watson_logo.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for IBM Watson done In-house (with others)\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop style=\"background-color:rgba(16,16,24)!important\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ibm_watson_logo_inverse.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo on black and animated.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ibm_watson_logo_colors.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for IBM Watson done In-house (with others)\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ibm_watson_color_animations.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Color variations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo came from the visual language of IBM&#8217;s &#8220;Smarter Planet&#8221; icons, <a href=\"http:\/\/visitoffice.com\/work\/smarter-planet\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">designed by Office<\/a> around 2009 &#8211; 10, that had the recurring visual structure of exclamation marks around circular compositions. As an abstract representation of AI &#8212; neural-looking, connected things &#8212; it was fine and I&#8217;m sure no one would have complained if they had kept using it for many more years. The new logo maintains the same structure and similar concept but is executed beautifully, capturing its three-dimensionality in great way through the use of gradients that fade into the back of the sphere. It now feels like the, metaphorically speaking, living system that is Watson. The color palette is quite great, avoiding the typical bright, in-your-face palettes we&#8217;ve been seeing these past few years. The animations seal the deal in terms of establishing the structure and presence of the icon.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ibm_watson_guidelines.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for IBM Watson done In-house (with others)\" \/>\n<figcaption>Guidelines.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ibm_watson_icons.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for IBM Watson done In-house (with others)\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icon set.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ibm_watson_banners.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Online banners.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ibm_watson_ad_style.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for IBM Watson done In-house (with others)\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sample ad details.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ibm_watson_airport_ad.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Animated ad.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ibm_watson_online.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for IBM Watson done In-house (with others)\" \/>\n<figcaption>Online presence.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/IBM_Watson_product.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for IBM Watson done In-house (with others)\" \/>\n<figcaption>App.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ibm_watson_world_of_watson.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for IBM Watson done In-house (with others)\" \/>\n<figcaption>World of Watson event materials.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ibm_watson_space_renders.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for IBM Watson done In-house (with others)\" \/>\n<figcaption>Physical space renders.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">Some of the applications are still somewhat loose, in development, or in some form of rendering &#8212; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/watson\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the website<\/a> is solid and a crisp representation of the identity &#8212; but even from looking at the sample guideline pages you can tell this is very well thought-out and has an attractive, contemporary, techie-but-not-<em>too<\/em>-techie aesthetic that faithfully represents the renewed design sense of IBM.
