The first one, Kiosko, was opened in 2011 when Ainsworth was trying to sell the location of his previous restaurant, Wushu, and decided to spruce up the space with a burger joint and attract some buyers. Instead he attracted a lot of followers. Later, he opened Bacoa, another small outpost, which is now known as <em>Little<\/em> Bacoa in lieu of its new flagship restaurant, Bacoa Universitat. Looking to possibly expand into a franchise, Bacoa has been working with a new identity since mid-2013 with Barcelona-based <a href=\"http:\/\/twopoints.net\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TwoPoints.Net<\/a> who also completed the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/media\/set\/?set=a.511709965549268.1073741825.139238422796426&#038;type=3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">redesign of the original Kiosk<\/a> in the same style and approach.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>One of the biggest influences were the typical spanish bars from Barcelona. Usually they were build in the seventies. They often use condensed sans-serif typefaces, cut out of acrylic glass. The color scheme of these bars is very limited. Usually the boards, napkins and doilies are only printed in two colors, red and blue. We also tried to embrace the sometimes amateurish design, which gives a typical spanish bar it&#8217;s own charm.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/twopoints.net\/en\/project\/bacoa\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TwoPoints.Net case study<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bacao_inspiration.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Bacoa by TwoPoints.Net\" \/>\n<figcaption>Typical lettering from the streets of Barcelona.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bacoa_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Bacoa by TwoPoints.Net\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bacoa_logo_Cities.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Bacoa by TwoPoints.Net\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo for different, possible, future city expansions.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The wordmark Bacoa can be written in different ways. Em dashes are used to add spaces in between letters. The flexible use of the wordmark allowed us to maintain simple typographic solutions without becoming repetitive.<br \/><br \/>We also played with the visual expression of the pronounciation of words, like for example &#8220;SO GOOOOOD&#8221;.

(See more of such <a href=\"http:\/\/www.trendlist.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a>). But looking at the extent of the work and the execution, there is a clear, positive distinction between Bacoa&#8217;s identity and the rest. The custom font, the limited color palette, the consistent spacing\/non-spacing, the application in the restaurant: everything has a graphic sophistication that makes it stand out.<\/p>\n<blockquote>The location of the burger bar is very central. It is just in between Pla&ccedil;a Catalunya and Pla&ccedil;a Universitat, but still belongs to the Eixample, a district which was build at the end 19th century and the begining of the 20th century. All the flats, stores and restaurants in that district have a similar shape. They are not very wide, but very deep. This was a challenge. We had to think of a way to make the pedestrians stop and look inside. We tried to achieve this by using a lot of light sources at the end of the restaurant.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/twopoints.net\/en\/project\/bacoa-universidad\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TwoPoints.Net case study<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bacoa_universitat_exterior.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Bacoa by TwoPoints.Net\" \/>\n<figcaption>Exterior of Bacoa Universitat, the flagship location.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bacoa_universitat_interior_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Bacoa by TwoPoints.Net\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bacoa_universitat_interior_00.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Bacoa by TwoPoints.Net\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bacoa_universitat_interior_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Bacoa by TwoPoints.Net\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bacoa_universitat_interior_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Bacoa by TwoPoints.Net\" \/>\n<figcaption>Interiors.
