Listing more than 450,000 cars each day, Auto Trader began as a group of magazines with a large circulation that peaked in 2000 but ceased in 2013 as the business moved completely to be a digital marketplace where it now attracts approximately 55 million cross-platform visits each month (70% of those coming through mobile devices). Recently Auto Trader introduced a new identity designed by London-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.studio-output.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Studio Output<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>We evolved the Auto Trader logo to work harder across digital platforms. A wider colour palette appeals to a broader audience base while building on the core blue &#038; red of the brand&#8217;s heritage. And a robust new type family brings a more welcoming tone to headlines, messaging and data visualisation.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.studio-output.com\/case_study\/auto-trader-rebrand\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Studio Output project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/autotrader_uk_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Auto Trader (UK) by Studio Output\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>This logo change is the equivalent of buying the new model of the same car: it&#8217;s familiar, it&#8217;s mostly the same, but it has improved aesthetics and performance. The old logo had a 1970s magazine aesthetic with its Avant Garde-esque wordmark and it did show a certain age. The new logo keeps the same proportions (and single-storey &#8220;a&#8221;) but updates with a contemporary sans serif that looks infinitely better (and is not a straight-up geometric sans). The looser spacing is very welcome as is the flat approach to the icon, which who knows what it is but it looks car-ish.<\/p>\n<blockquote>Auto Trader is the UK&#8217;s leading digital automotive marketplace. It makes exclusively digital products, with an average 55 million monthly visits &#8211; 70% of those on mobile. Despite all this, some people still think it&#8217;s a print magazine for middle-aged men.<br \/><br \/>The system builds on the brand&#8217;s heritage, embodying a personality that reflects the business as it is, not as it was &#8211; and evolving into something purpose-built for digital platforms.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.studio-output.com\/case_study\/auto-trader-rebrand\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Studio Output project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/autotrader_uk_id_elements.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Auto Trader (UK) by Studio Output\" \/>\n<figcaption>Identity elements.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/autotrader_uk_type_family.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Auto Trader (UK) by Studio Output\" \/>\n<figcaption>Type family.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>Auto Trader used a lot of product-led photography, creating the sense of a transactional brand. We introduced a more emotive approach, helping the audience to picture themselves using the vehicles. Copy was vital to this, and we worked with Reed Words to establish a more conversational Auto Trader voice, with guidelines for the internal teams using it.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.studio-output.com\/case_study\/auto-trader-rebrand\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Studio Output project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/autotrader_uk_photography_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Auto Trader (UK) by Studio Output\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/autotrader_uk_photography_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Auto Trader (UK) by Studio Output\" \/>\n<figcaption>Photography approach.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>Beyond the car itself, Auto Trader often struggled to visualise abstract topics like part exchange or insurance, without resorting to clich\u00e9d photography. Ownership of manufacturer imagery had always been a challenge too. We introduced an illustration system to solve these problems, while communicating a more friendly personality.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.studio-output.com\/case_study\/auto-trader-rebrand\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Studio Output project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/autotrader_uk_illustration_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Auto Trader (UK) by Studio Output\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/autotrader_uk_illustration_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Auto Trader (UK) by Studio Output\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/autotrader_uk_illustration_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Auto Trader (UK) by Studio Output\" \/>\n<figcaption>Illustration approach.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/autotrader_uk_website.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Auto Trader (UK) by Studio Output\" \/>\n<figcaption>Website sample pages.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The photography and illustration approaches aren&#8217;t fully novel or super exciting but they are consistent in look and warm in feelings. The combination of manufacturer-provided  photos with the illustration backgrounds is the more adventuresome application and it does look nice.<\/p>\n<blockquote>In digital products, the experience of a brand is informed by the quality and responsiveness of interaction. We explored and defined a set of motion principles that will guide the Auto Trader teams, building the sense of a united brand across all platforms.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.studio-output.com\/case_study\/auto-trader-rebrand\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Studio Output project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video controls><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/autotrader_uk_Personality.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Animation personality.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video controls><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/autotrader_uk_ui_elements.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>UI elements.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video controls><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/autotrader_uk_Motion Principles.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Motion principles.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video controls><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/autotrader_uk_case_study.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Identity case study.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">The motion approach is also familiar &#8212; not in a they-copied-it-from-someone way but in that we now expect all UI elements to animate smoothly and engagingly and most apps and websites have a similar approach. Overall, this does feel like it rejuvenates the brand and makes it look less like a car connoisseur-only brand to a general consumer looking to buy or sell a car with the least friction possible.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1977, Auto Trader is the UK and Ireland&apos;s largest digital automotive marketplace.
