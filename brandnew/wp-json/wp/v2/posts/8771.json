Based in Canada, ecobee created the world&#8217;s first smart thermostat &#8212; Nest, the more well-known brand was launched in 2010 &#8212; that serves as the company&#8217;s flagship product and digital hub for the rest of the security-minded product line-up that includes occupancy sensors, smart light switches, smart cameras, and contact sensors. In general, ecobee comes across as one of the most polite and genuinely environmentally-conscious companies I have ever written an introduction for &#8212; their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ecobee.com\/en-us\/about\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">About page<\/a> makes me want to hug them. With the recent release of the most recent version of its thermostat, ecobee introduced a new identity designed, I believe, in-house.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>[We] reconnected with one of our core elements, the squircle. The circle and square hybrid is the shape of our primary products and has been a source of inspiration. We like that this shape is unique, ownable, and adaptable. The connection between the SmartThermostat and the letterforms within the wordmark is clear. This helps us create a consistent visual identity that&#8217;s easily recognizable. The new ecobee logo was designed to incorporate and highlight the squircle shape. It is comprised of the mark and wordmark with the logo at the core of the identity.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/brand.ecobee.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ecobee brand microsite<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ecobee_shape_squircle.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for ecobee\" \/>\n<figcaption>Embracing the &#8220;Squircle&#8221;.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ecobee_shape_all.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for ecobee\" \/>\n<figcaption>The shape of the SmartThermostat informs the logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ecobee_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for ecobee\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ecobee_logo_animation.mov\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo animation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ecobee_logo_color_options.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for ecobee\" \/>\n<figcaption>Color variations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo was technically fine but it wasn&#8217;t particularly good with a rather odd drawing of a bee and a generic-looking sans serif, all in an unappealing green color. (The name of the company was meant as an homage to honey bees&#8217; ability to regulate their hives&#8217; temperature, hence the bee icon.) The new logo sends the bee off into the distance and introduces a sleek, elegant, custom wordmark where each and every letter echoes the unique shape of their flagship thermostat. This is logo-product synergy at its best and most subtle. When I first saw the logo on its own &#8212; without reading about its origin or even being aware of their product &#8212; I was like &#8220;Meh, it&#8217;s fine&#8221; but its visual tie-in with the product is pretty fantastic. It also has a major upgrade in that it now looks more like a tech lifestyle brand better suited to either compete or complement other brands like Nest and Apple.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ecobee_logo_subbrands_02.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for ecobee\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ecobee_logo_subbrands.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for ecobee\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sub-brands.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The proprietary typeface was designed with the award-winning design consultancy Pentagram.

Its limited use in sub-brands, as opposed to every headline on the website, makes it feel more special and restrained.<\/p>\n<blockquote>Icons accompany value propositions and features as a useful tool to add clarity and inject brand personality.

I haven&#8217;t seen art direction and photo production of this depth in a long time. Every little detail, from the weird minerals in the product shots to the selection of plants in the lifestyle shots, has been so carefully considered. The lighting, the scenes, the materials&#8230; everything is so well thought out and so&#8230; different. It&#8217;s not just moody portraits of people or slick photos of products on white backgrounds. There is like a whole alternate universe throughout these images. The elongated floors and ceilings of the lifestyle photos remind me of those scenes in <em>Stranger Things<\/em> when the characters go into the always-wet black space, except this is happy.<\/p>\n<blockquote>Inspired by the elements of earth, air, fire, and water, each of the main colorways in the ecobee palette has an identity that we can use to tell our brand story. The color identities are rooted in the positive emotion and connection with nature that we want customers to associate with ecobee.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/brand.ecobee.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ecobee brand microsite<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ecobee_color_stories_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for ecobee\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ecobee_color_stories_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for ecobee\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ecobee_color_stories_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for ecobee\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ecobee_color_stories_04.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for ecobee\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ecobee_color_stories_05.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for ecobee\" \/>\n<figcaption>How the color palette plays out across product and lifestyle photography.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video controls controlsList=\"nodownload\" poster=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ecobee_video_Sensor_Bedroom.jpg\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ecobee_video_Sensor_Bedroom.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<hr \/>\n<div class=\"video-container\"><video controls controlsList=\"nodownload\" poster=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ecobee_video_SmartCamera_Watchtower.jpg\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ecobee_video_SmartCamera_Watchtower.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<hr \/>\n<div class=\"video-container\"><video controls controlsList=\"nodownload\" poster=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ecobee_video_Thermostat_Reception.jpg\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ecobee_video_Thermostat_Reception.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<hr \/>\n<div class=\"video-container\"><video controls controlsList=\"nodownload\" poster=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ecobee_video_DW_Terrace.jpg\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ecobee_video_DW_Terrace.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Video animations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>As if the photography wasn&#8217;t enough, they have also created some 3D environments that extend the visual language of colors and textures but with a surreal twist.
