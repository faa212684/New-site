Despite a recent dip in sales, it&#8217;s the second best-selling beer in the U.S. behind Bud Light. One of Coors Light&#8217;s biggest claims to fame are its <a href=\"http:\/\/www.millercoors.com\/our-beers\/innovation.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cold-activated cans and bottles<\/a> where the iconic Rocky Mountains depicted turn blue. Earlier this month Coors Light <a href=\"http:\/\/www.millercoorsblog.com\/trending\/coors-light-logo\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">introduced a revised logo and packaging<\/a> designed by San Francisco, CA-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.turnerduckworth.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Turner Duckworth<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/coors_light_evolution.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Coors Light by Turner Duckworth\" \/>\n<figcaption>Evolution of the brand.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/coors_light_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Coors Light by Turner Duckworth\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Like most mainstream consumer packaging logos, Coors Light has evolved from a cool, minimalist vintage look (because it <em>was<\/em> vintage at some point) to a mash-up of NFL and cartoon typography in its most recent version, featuring a spiked &#8220;LIGHT&#8221; lettering that would look quite comfortable on a college uniform and a script wordmark buried in strokes and drop shadows. Just as Turner Duckworth did with Coca-Cola, they have stripped as much crap as possible from the logo to reveal a very nice, thin script Coors and a still-spike-ish yet more dignified &#8220;LIGHT&#8221; descriptor. The logo looks best when kept outside the mountain graphic (as shown in the packaging below) but using the mountain to crop Coors makes for a slightly playful approach.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/coors_light_logo_roundel.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Coors Light by Turner Duckworth\" \/>\n<figcaption>&#8220;Born in the Rockies&#8221; logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/coors_light_the_silver_bullet.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Coors Light by Turner Duckworth\" \/>\n<figcaption>&#8220;The Silver Bullet&#8221; logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>A couple of supporting logos have been added, neither of which seems to have gotten the same attention to detail as the main logo. The &#8220;S&#8221; in silver is beautiful but the lettering deteriorates as it reaches the &#8220;r&#8221; and the rest of the typography on that one is very awkward. The roundel logo with the Rocky Mountain is fine but not terribly inspiring.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/coors_light_truck.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Coors Light by Turner Duckworth\" \/>\n<figcaption>Truck.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/MuqSII5A5Tk\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>One of many TV\/Web spots.

I guess somewhere in between. With the cleaner approach it makes me think of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=evian&#038;es_sm=91&#038;source=lnms&#038;tbm=isch&#038;sa=X&#038;ei=3E5kVZGEG9CeyATq8YAo&#038;ved=0CAcQ_AUoAQ&#038;biw=1294&#038;bih=866\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Evian<\/a>.

Elements like the taps and pint above showcase how nice this identity can look and both Turner Duckworth and client alike have done a great job in steering this brand away from almost looking like a parody of its category.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Introduced in 1978, Coors Light is a light beer produced by the Coors Brewing Company in Golden, CO, and owned by the vast beer consortium of MillerCoors.
