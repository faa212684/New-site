It is a way of shifting the blame away from themselves. I am not going to initiate a political debate here: there are other, better places for this. But for one reason or another, Russian banks didn&#8217;t suffer too much from the recession.  And now one of them has even launched a rebranding campaign. I always felt <a href=\"http:\/\/mdmbank.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MDM Bank<\/a> was one of those banks which people kind of know about, but don&#8217;t really go to for personal banking. Or, to put it differently, I know that the bank exists; I must have used its ATMs at some point, but I honestly don&#8217;t know anyone who has an account with them. Yet evidence suggests it is, in fact, one of the more successful Russian banks: its credit ratings are some of the best in the country.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mdm_bank_colors.gif\" alt=\"MDM Bank Logo, Before and After\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In August 2009, MDM Bank <a href=\"http:\/\/mdmbank.com\/articles\/43204\/news-material\">completed a merger<\/a> with another Siberian-based bank, URSA Bank &mdash; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mdm_bank_merger.jpg\" onclick=\"window.open('http:\/\/https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mdm_bank_merger.jpg','popup','width=699,height=360,scrollbars=no,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false\">click here for a scary merger logo<\/a>. Now they have launched a common identity, designed by the Russian studio <a href=\"http:\/\/bbdo-branding.ru\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BBDO Branding<\/a> (no English web-site, I&#8217;m afraid), who had designed URSA Bank&#8217;s logo back in 2007. Incidentally, this is the same studio that did such a <a href=\"http:\/\/bbdo-branding.ru\/35\">poor job<\/a> on the new identity for the Russian Railways.<\/p>\n<p>I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;m a huge fan of this creation, either. Granted, the new logotype is an improvement &mdash; but mostly because there was much to improve on. The typography in the new logo (set in FF Dax or a variant of it) is crisp and looks quite modern &mdash; at least for Russia. It is clearly superior to the previous version: the Latin &#8220;k&#8221; with an ascender in the old Russian logo makes me shudder, and did it really have to be so condensed? There is a clear desire to develop a more Western brand here, and I think in this respect the typography is a success. The symbol, however, is a different matter. Granted, it is better than the old one. (What was this thing supposed to be? Was it meant to be a pile of gold? It&#8217;s a pile all right). Here&#8217;s what they have to say about the new symbol:<\/p>\n<blockquote>&#8220;MDM Bank&#8217;s new logo will feature an image of the sun reflecting the bank&#8217;s main values: reliability and stability, openness and partnership, a warm attitude to individual and corporate clients, and the accessibility and simplicity of the bank&#8217;s services. Since ancient times the sun has had strong associations with gold and gave round shape to coins. Moreover, sun is also a symbol of power, energy and success. It is an exceptionally friendly sign full of warmness, optimism and positive emotions&#8221;.<\/blockquote>\n<p>The orange circle represents the sun. The sun represents warmth. (And gold coins). Now, isn&#8217;t this simply boring?<\/p>\n<p><object height=398 width=530><param NAME=\"movie\" VALUE=\"http:\/\/mdm.ru\/\/files\/51717\/uflvplayer_500x375.swf\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" \/><param name=FlashVars value=\"way=http:\/\/mdm.ru\/\/files\/51745\/mdm_logo.flv &#038;swf=\/files\/51717\/uflvplayer_500x375.swf&#038;w=530&#038;h=398&#038;time_seconds=99.12&#038;pic=http:\/\/mdm.ru\/\/common\/data\/pub\/images\/13743\/13743.jpg&#038;autoplay=0&#038;tools=1&#038;skin=none&#038;volume=70&#038;comment=\"><embed src=\"http:\/\/mdm.ru\/\/files\/51717\/uflvplayer_500x375.swf\" allowFullScreen=\"true\" type=\"application\/x-shockwave-flash\" flashvars=\"way=http:\/\/mdm.ru\/\/files\/51745\/mdm_logo.flv &#038;swf=http:\/\/mdm.ru\/\/files\/51717\/uflvplayer_500x375.swf&#038;w=530&#038;h=398&#038;time_seconds=99.12&#038;pic=http:\/\/mdm.ru\/\/common\/data\/pub\/images\/13743\/13743.jpg&#038;autoplay=0&#038;tools=1&#038;skin=none&#038;volume=70&#038;comment=\" height=\"398\" width=\"530\"><\/embed><\/object><\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what I think: this is yet another missed opportunity for Russian brand designers. Here was a chance to do something really exciting, a logo that would be truly innovative for the Russian market and show MDM Bank&#8217;s Western partners that it is open to new ideas. Instead, the designers played it safe. The new identity is decent, I suppose; it doesn&#8217;t jar the eye. But logos like these are a dime a dozen, and there is nothing to differentiate MDM Bank from their competitors.
