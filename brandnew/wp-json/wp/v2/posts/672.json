I mention this since the logo above is the new name and identity for what used to be UKTV Gold +1, and is <a href=\"http:\/\/uktv.co.uk\/uktv\/item\/aid\/603804\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">one of three channels getting a new name and logo to be broadcast this coming October<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/uktv_changes.jpg\" alt=\"UKTV Channel Changes\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Until now all UKTV channels &mdash; except for the Dave channel which dances to its own beat &mdash; followed the same brand architecture formula of using the lovely UKTV logo locked up with the name of the channel in Gotham, and when necessary, the &#8220;+1&#8221; identifier. I have to admit that I am not familiar at all with the content of these channels, nor the associations viewers make with them, so I will have to defer to our British counterparts to ascertain the appropriateness of these changes (or to correct me of any wrong assumptions I make). As far as logos, well, the feelings are global I think. <\/p>\n<p>At first I thought the Watch logo was supposed to be focused on reality TV, running every single <em>Big Brother<\/em> episode ever; the name and watchful hidden camera icon make it seem overly voyeuristic. Instead, from what I can gather, it just runs a few drama programs and bills as its flagship the <em><a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Richard_&#038;_Judy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Richard &amp; Judy<\/a><\/em> show which is moving from competitor Channel 4 to UKTV. It&#8217;s an eye catching logo for sure, and is somewhat hypnotic, so as a reaction I like it, but I&#8217;m not sure I get it. The typography seems needlessly futuristic.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/uktv_alibi_logo.gif\" alt=\"Alibi Logo, New\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Alibi will be devoted to crime shows and other drama programming. I kind of like this one, specially with the play of the missing dot on the first &#8220;i&#8221;. And the typewriter typeface adds to the private investigator mood.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/uktv_gold_logo.gif\" alt=\"Gold Logo, New\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The absolute worst in this new package is for the comedy channel Gold, with a very unpleasant typeface in a very uncomfortable curve. There is no hierarchy, no distinction between tag line and name, and it sure as hell isn&#8217;t funny. Well, it&#8217;s funny like watching someone fall flat on their face.<\/p>\n<p>Unlike Discovery, which has been making some hits and misses with their rebrandings but have, overall, maintained a certain simplicity throughout, these UKTV channels &mdash; developed by UKTV&#8217;s marketing team with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.redbeemedia.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Red Bee Media<\/a> &mdash; are very disjointed and appear to dilute the brand with highly dissonant logos.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Thanks to Paul Lloyd Johnson for the tip.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[66,12,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/672"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=672"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/672\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=672"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=672"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=672"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
