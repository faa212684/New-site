For others, smaller institutions that cater not only to their financial and insurance needs but also to their religious beliefs is the way to go. Since there is no Mexican-Almost-American-Jewish financial and insurance company I stick with the aforementioned. But for those that follow the Anabaptist faith &mdash; &#8220;a Protestant Christian reform movement in Europe during the 16th century&#8221; with various denominations like the Mennonite, Brethren, and Amish church groups related to it &mdash; the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mma-online.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mennonite Mutual Aid<\/a> (MMA) has allowed &#8220;individuals, organizations, and businesses integrate faith and values into their financial decisions&#8221; since 1945, when it served only those that belonged to the Mennonite Church. Today customers don&#8217;t have to belong to the Mennonite Church and are not required to adhere Anabaptist beliefs to be able to use MMA, so having Mennonite in its name was starting to become limiting and they decided to change it.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>Everence evokes the ideas of reverence, everlasting, forever, and permanence &mdash; symbolizes the organizations&#8217; tie to faith and the nature of our services.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mma-online.org\/showitem.aspx?id=9237\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press Release<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p>Also, the MMA acronym has been adopted by a different kind of organization:<\/p>\n<blockquote><em>The acronym &#8220;MMA&#8221; has been taken over by <a href=\"MMA Fighting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mixed Martial Arts<\/a>, particularly online<\/em>. Mixed Martial Arts has become a social phenomenon with a values system much different than our own. Today and into the future, our brand online is important to those who want to reach us and use our financial services from anywhere, at anytime.<\/blockquote>\n<p>The new name is fairly interesting as it manages to sound faith-oriented without being specific to any religion and it may even sound kind of cool. Okay, relatively cool. With the new name, of course, comes a new logo, designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.futurebrand.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Futurebrand<\/a>.\n<blockquote>The logo represents a vine (with a cross in the center), symbolizing the faith community and people involved in the organizations.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mma-online.org\/showitem.aspx?id=9237\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press Release<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p>The icon is really what made me interested in this story. It&#8217;s a very nice execution that, like the name, can also be interpreted as something to do with faith and religion. While it&#8217;s probably not the most original logo &mdash; I bet you could find logos with similar structures or similar shapes &mdash; the way these come together in this specific case is rather pleasing. The typography is acceptable, even if the &#8220;E&#8221; is annoying with that rounded top corner. It&#8217;s straightforward and it looks serious. Overall, a nice corporate evolution that balances the services offered with its founding beliefs.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to Marcos Wright Kuhns for the tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_100412_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_100412_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_100412_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_100412_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_100412_config_03.xml&#038;xyz=poll_100412_votes_03.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv3\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv3\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,37,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1074"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1074"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1074\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1074"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1074"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1074"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
