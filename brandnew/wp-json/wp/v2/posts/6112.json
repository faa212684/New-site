The logo and packaging were designed by local firm <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/mnassociates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">M &#8212; N Associates<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><p>While the product launch is indeed far outside our timeframe for publishing &#8212; nearly two years &#8212; the project case study was only published in November and since most of us are not up to date on all things Vietnam I didn&#8217;t mind making an exception.<\/p>\n<blockquote>JUS logo was design simple as it needs to be with organic curves and unbalanced weight-arms to create the natural visual identity for the brand due to its organic ingredients.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/58524953\/JUS-Juice-Up-Saigon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">M &#8212; N Associates project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/jus_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for JUS by M &#8212; N Associates\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>There isn&#8217;t much to the logo &#8212; in part because there is just three letters to the name. The quote above mentions that it&#8217;s uneven due to the product being organic which is a safe and not overly complex concept. I like the letterforms in principle and the logo looks good when applied but on its own and in a large size as directly above there is something off about it &#8212; I think it&#8217;s the rounded corners that seem <em>too<\/em> perfectly even, determined by Adobe Illustrator&#8217;s Stylize > Round Corners command rather than the eye. But that&#8217;s really pulling hairs, it&#8217;s a cool-looking logo.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/jus_business_cards.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for JUS by M &#8212; N Associates\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>One odd thing about the identity are the icons, which make an appearance in the business cards and in the store, that have a completely different aesthetic from the logo, having very streamlined, single-thickness lines instead of thickening\/thinning lines as the letterforms. The use of Gotham in the business cards and other parts of the identity isn&#8217;t the best complementary choice and its tracked-out use is off-putting.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/jus_brochure.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for JUS by M &#8212; N Associates\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/jus_brochure_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for JUS by M &#8212; N Associates\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brochure\/product catalog\/newsletter.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>In contrast, the serif used in the printed materials above is quite nice and the overall aesthetic of those pieces is far more interesting.<\/p>\n<blockquote>Based on the concept of equilateral triangle of yoga that connects body &#8212; spirit &#8212; mind together, we created an unique equilateral triangle bottle shape.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/58524953\/JUS-Juice-Up-Saigon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">M &#8212; N Associates project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/jus_packaging_all_in_line.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for JUS by M &#8212; N Associates\" \/>\n<figcaption>Packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>But what we are here for, really, is the packaging. As dead-simple as it is, it strikes a great balance between being young and hip but also somehow handsome. The white silkscreen logo looks great against the colorful contents with the white cap accenting it. The triangle structure of the bottle lends itself nicely for creating three separate panels &#8212; one for the logo and two for information &#8212; and I love how they also printed on the rounded corners.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/jus_packaging_hues_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for JUS by M &#8212; N Associates\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/jus_packaging_hues_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for JUS by M &#8212; N Associates\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/jus_packaging_hues_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for JUS by M &#8212; N Associates\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/jus_packaging_hues_04.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for JUS by M &#8212; N Associates\" \/>\n<figcaption>Packaging sorted by hues.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/jus_packaging_with_fruit.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for JUS by M &#8212; N Associates\" \/>\n<figcaption>Packaging with ingredients.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/jus_packaging_case.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for JUS by M &#8212; N Associates\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/jus_packaging_case_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for JUS by M &#8212; N Associates\" \/>\n<figcaption>Cases.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/jus_ginger_shot.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for JUS by M &#8212; N Associates\" \/>\n<figcaption>Ginger shot bottle.
