The new name is just <a href=\"http:\/\/www.muchmore.ca\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MuchMore<\/a>, dropping the music, which is weird because &#8220;MuchMore&#8221; doesn&#8217;t mean, well, much without the &#8220;music&#8221; part. At least that&#8217;s what I found while Googling. But that&#8217;s not necessarily the driving point of this review. The new logo was apparently <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vfs.com\/blog\/category\/program-related\/digital-design\/?id=13\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">redesigned in-house by Vancouver Film School graduate Nicolas Alexander<\/a>. The old logo was, of course, a mess of Garamondic proportions that lacked any sort of intention or interest. The new one, on the other hand, is striving hard for both intention and interest, but I&#8217;m not sure what either is. Maybe it&#8217;s explained in how the logo animates &mdash; not being in Canada, I can&#8217;t see the on-air applications and the animation group, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.crushinc.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Crush<\/a>, that did the broadcast work does not have anything on their site &mdash; but I don&#8217;t get what the missing pieces of the &#8220;M&#8221;s and the &#8220;O&#8221; are supposed to be. Loading? More? Much more? What? Why just MMO get the slicing treatment? Nonetheless, it&#8217;s an improvement and it looks fun but, for me, not MuchMore positive things to say than that.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Thanks to Kyle Richmond for the tip.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,66,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/812"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=812"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/812\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=812"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=812"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=812"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
