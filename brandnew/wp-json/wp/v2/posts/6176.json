Hicks\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.juice-society.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Juice Society<\/a> is a small-batch juicer in Austin, TX, with one juice bar location and shelf presence in select local cafes, hotels, and grocers. Their packaging, designed by local designer <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ryanshicks.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ryan S. Hicks<\/a>, doesn&#8217;t break any category conventions but it presents the juice varieties in a crisp, fun, and elegant way &#8212; even a little scientific-looking with the iconography above the name of each juice. It also pulls off nicely the use of three different sans serifs &#8212; a condensed one for the logo, a Humanist for the names, and a monospace for the ingredients. The winking happy face is a fun accent to the identity. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ryanshicks.com\/work\/juice-society\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Rezult by Fedoriv<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_rezult.jpg\" alt=\"Rezult by Fedoriv\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/rezult.pro\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rezult<\/a> is an international manufacturer of MDF and sawn timber of high quality based in Ukraine. Its identity, by Kiev, Ukraine-based <a href=\"http:\/\/fedoriv.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fedoriv<\/a> is the absolute best identity you will see for an MDF flooring company. I will admit that when I first saw this I thought it was one of those fake Behance projects because I didn&#8217;t think a floor company could look this cool and bad-ass but they do! Check out <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pg\/rezult.pro\/photos\/?ref=page_internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">their Facebook photos<\/a> that show some of their displays, which may not be as extra crisp as the renders above but definitely killing it in the display category. The logo is maybe a little on the Xtreme side but it&#8217;s nicely done and it looks great on swag. I usually don&#8217;t include that many corporate stuff in Friday Likes because they are usually not too TGIF-ish but this one should get you in the mood for Friyay. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/fedoriv.com\/work\/rezult\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">St. Erhard by Bedow<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_sterhard_2.jpg\" alt=\"St. Erhard by Bedow\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.st-erhard.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">St. Erhard<\/a> is a craft brewer in Bamberg, Germany, one of the first in the country. Its new packaging, designed by Stockholm, Sweden-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bedow.se\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bedow<\/a> complements the quirky bottle with stark-white labels featuring abstract, geometric names for the three beers &#8212; can you figure out the names before I spell them out? (I could only figure out one this early in the a.m.) &#8212; Farmer, Mayflower, and Sison. It&#8217;s really pushing the boundaries of readability but even as abstract compositions they are kind of interesting. Production-wise, the labels are offset printed with each of the colorful shapes foil stamped (allowing me to meet my weekly quota of foil stamping). <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bedow.se\/work\/packaging\/st-erhard-packaging\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"A couple of minimalist packaging projects book-end a striking corporate job this week with work from Austin, Kiev, and Stockholm&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[51,36,11,26],"tags":[184,1156],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6176"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=6176"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6176\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=6176"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=6176"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=6176"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
