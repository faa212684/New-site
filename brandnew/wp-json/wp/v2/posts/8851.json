Episodes will range from 30 to 45 minutes.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It is a subscription-based podcast &#8212; $5 a month or $50 a year &#8212; which will allow us to keep the blog free and open while providing the podcast as a &#8220;premium&#8221; add-on that will build on the content you already enjoy.<\/p>\n<p>Our model is directly influenced and inspired by the <a href=\"https:\/\/dithering.fm\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dithering<\/a> podcast by <a href=\"https:\/\/stratechery.com\">Ben Thompson<\/a> and <a  href=\"https:\/\/daringfireball.net\">John Gruber<\/a>, which was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/how_we_doin.php#comment-4930251218\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mentioned by Brand New reader, Evan, in the comments<\/a>. Their model and set-up instantly caught our attention and for the past 20 days we have focused on bringing our own podcast to life.<\/p>\n<p>The first official episode will be released next Tuesday, June 23, but you can now subscribe and listen to a quick introduction from me and Bryony. Even if you don&#8217;t subscribe yet, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/thefollowup\/podcast\/000-an-introduction\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">you can listen to it<\/a> and perhaps our intro\/outro music will convince you : )<\/p>\n<p>We recorded the first episode last week and the content is seriously good and I don&#8217;t mean that in a sales-y way&#8230; I think it really opens up the understanding on how these projects get done and gives us all a peek into their context.<\/p>\n<p>If you hate podcasts but still want to support Brand New, go ahead, subscribe, and ignore the podcasts!<\/p>\n<p>We have some FAQs on the site about how\/where to listen as well as some other matters. We are completely new at this podcasting thing so any and all feedback is and will be welcome so that we can improve with each week.<\/p>\n<p class=\"end\">Again, thanks for the encouragement and vote of confidence that we can do this!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"After the amazing and (amazingly) supportive response we received from many on you on the state of UnderConsideration last month, we were encouraged, inspired, and motivated to finally take the plunge and start a podcast!
