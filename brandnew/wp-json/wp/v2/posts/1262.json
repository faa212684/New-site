Almost 20 years later, Comedy Central is one of the most popular channels thanks to, of course, <em>The Daily Show<\/em>, <em>The Colbert Report<\/em>, and <em>South Park<\/em> &mdash; not to mention the always hilarious Roasts and to a certain degree the antics of <em>Tosh.0<\/em>. Yesterday, Comedy Central unveiled a drastically different new identity, designed by New York-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thelabnyc.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">thelab<\/a> that will begin playing on air in January 2011.<\/p><!--more--><figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/93636392?title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"360\" height=\"203\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>New identity montage.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<br \/>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/comedy_central_explanation.gif\" alt=\"Comedy Central\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Freeze frame of explanation from the video.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/comedy_central_horizontal.gif\" alt=\"Comedy Central\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Horizontal lock-up.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/comedy_central_colors.gif\" alt=\"Comedy Central\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Additional colors.

Surprise, surprise, huh? The two basic complaints are that <em>a)<\/em> it&#8217;s boring and <em>b)<\/em> it looks like the copyright symbol. Both complaints are typical knee-jerk reactions that are very undeserved for a channel that is very smart about its programming and positioning. So, let&#8217;s argue. The old logo was certainly not &#8220;boring.&#8221; It had pow and it had wow. We had grown accustomed to it. But when you think about the place Comedy Central occupies in culture and media, it&#8217;s more akin to CNN, ESPN, or any of the major networks. The old logo simply can not be used as an endorsing mark for what the channel represents &mdash; the logo was too cartoonish. Like showing up to work at a Fortune 100 company in a Hawaiian shirt. The new logo is simple &mdash; not <em>boring<\/em>, a big difference &mdash; it is easier to reproduce across multiple media and it still has a small wink of humor in the &#8220;Central&#8221; being flipped upside down.<\/p>\n<p>In its simplicity, the two &#8220;C&#8221;s form what some find an offensive copyright mark. Well, that&#8217;s pretty smart if you ask me. Because it&#8217;s obvious they are co-opting it and making it work in their favor. In the video and the little character logos directly above the text, you can see them using the &#8220;CC&#8221; icon exactly like a copyright symbol, placing it to the top right of all their characters, from John Stewart to Doctor Zoidberg. While the copyright symbol demarcates as &#8220;hands off,&#8221; Comedy Central&#8217;s logo demarcates as &#8220;this is funny shit.&#8221; Comedy is about taking it the familiar and twisting it, and that&#8217;s exactly what this logo is doing.<\/p>\n<p>The animation reel also shows that the simplicity of the logo can have some of the pow and the wow that the old logo inherently had, and I would also say that this is the first iPad-inspired logo package, with some of the animations clearly mimicking the swiping, flipping effect of going through media files. This identity can&#8217;t be dismissed so easily as boring or stupid&hellip; then again, some people just don&#8217;t have a sense of humor.<\/p>\n<p>The obligatory fake logo Twitter account can be found <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ComedyCentralC\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@ComedyCentralC<\/a>.
