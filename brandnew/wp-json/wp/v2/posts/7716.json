The identity and packaging, designed by Helsinki, Finland-based <a href=\"https:\/\/werklig.com\/agency\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Werklig<\/a>, equally evoke a Nordic state of mind with an extra clean, contemporary, and just the right amount of weird approach. The latter is manifested in the wordmark where the &#8220;N&#8221;, &#8220;U&#8221;, and &#8220;A&#8221; look as if they have been cropped very tight on the top and bottom, transforming an otherwise basic sans serif into something much more interesting. The packaging uses 205TF&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.205.tf\/Font\/23\/louize\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Louize<\/a> with Trade Gothic for a lovely set of boxes and labels with a stark simplicity that complement the beautiful frosted bottles with wooden caps. Would definitely smear on my mug after a long day of blogging. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/werklig.com\/project\/henua-organics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Evermore London by POST<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_evermore.jpg\" alt=\"Evermore London by POST\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/evermorelondon.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Evermore London<\/a> is a brand of hand-crafted, sustainable, vegan, luxury candles based, as its name implies, in London. The packaging, designed by local firm <a href=\"https:\/\/deliveredbypost.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">POST<\/a> revolves around an elegant serif &#8212; anyone able to identify it? &#8212; that is confidently and prominently used in the boxes and candle vessels. The former in a lovely range of colored, textured paper in black foil and the latter in a bad-ass black cylinder in gold foil, all punctuated by a Gill Sans-esque sans. The only questionable element (not shown above) is the back of the vessels that have some text in a curve as if it were the smoke of the candle which is oddly cheesy. But we are here to celebrate, so light up those sustainable vegan candles y&#8217;all! <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/deliveredbypost.com\/projects\/evermore-london\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Provisions Marou by Rice Creative<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_provisions_marou.jpg\" alt=\"Provisions Marou by Rice Creative\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/MAROU.CHOCOLATE\/posts\/provisions-marou-cacao-powder-is-100-natural-and-non-alkalized-we-want-to-retain\/2159531020723616\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Provisions<\/a> is the not-as-luxurious range of cacao powders, nibs, and spreads from Vietnam-based luxury chocolatier <a href=\"https:\/\/marouchocolate.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Marou<\/a>. Designed by Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam-based <a href=\"https:\/\/rice-creative.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rice Creative<\/a>, who have designed most (maybe all) of Marou&#8217;s products (and identity), the packaging is as straightforward as it gets with a single typeface &#8212; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.typography.com\/fonts\/tungsten\/overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tungsten<\/a> &#8212; and nothing more. But it&#8217;s the loose spacing in the product type, the embossed gold reproduction of the product range, and the rich colors contrasting against the gold cans that make this a beautiful exercise in simplicity. To top it all off you then have the mouthwatering chocolate color once you open the cans as the most magnificent color in the palette.
