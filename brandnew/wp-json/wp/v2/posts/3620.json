Designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/toormix.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Toormix<\/a>, the identity hinges on a smiling heart made out of the sideways &#8220;E&#8221; from its wordmark. It&#8217;s maybe a little <em>too<\/em> cute on its own but when put to use in the floor tiles and as a pattern it becomes quite fetching. The identity also features some watercolor drawings, a wide range of icons, and a pattern of apothecary jars. It&#8217;s also all maybe a little <em>too<\/em> much stuff for a single pharmacy but when it&#8217;s apparent that both designer and client are having fun, why not? <a href=\"http:\/\/toormix.com\/project\/farmacia-esplugas\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Popote&#8217;s by Violaine &amp; J&eacute;r&eacute;my<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_popotes.jpg\" alt=\"Popote's by Violaine &amp; J&eacute;r&eacute;my\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">Spotted earlier this week on our own <a href=\"http:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/artofthemenu\/archives\/popotes.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Art of the Menu<\/a>, the logo for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/popotesny\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Popote&#8217;s<\/a> &mdash; a group of French-born food lovers living in Brooklyn preparing pop-up dinners and catering &mdash; caught my eye because it&#8217;s the best use of a belly in a logo. Designed by Paris-based <a href=\"http:\/\/violaineetjeremy.fr\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">J&eacute;r&eacute;my<\/a> the illustration of a dapper man that looks exactly like a French-born food lover living in Brooklyn also stands in as a &#8220;P&#8221; for Popotes (which comes from the French expression &#8220;faire la popote&#8221;, meaning cooking family style) and it makes for a delightful character. The wordmark has a fun vibe and the &#8220;O&#8221;s look like dinner plates.  And I would take my charcuterie wrapped in that pattern any day of the week. <a href=\"http:\/\/violaineetjeremy.fr\/#\/works\/popotes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">GMUND Urban by Paperlux<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_gmund-urban.jpg\" alt=\"GMUND Urban by Paperlux\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">More stand-alone packaging than full-scale identity this project by Hamburg, Germany-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.paperlux.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Paperlux<\/a> for paper company GMUND&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/us.gmund.com\/shop\/gmund-urban.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Urban line<\/a> has plenty to like. Of particular awesomeness is the copper frame found on the different items that connects all of them together, much like a street in a city. Without the clever photography and proper placement this would probably be a hard read but, on their own, each item in this paper line is beautifully designed with minimal typography letting the sumptuous papers do the heavy lifting. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/21307067\/GMUND\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project here<\/strong><\/a><\/strong>.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"From playful to serious we have you covered this week with work from Barcelona, Paris, and Hamburg&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[39,53,769,1085,564],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3620"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3620"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3620\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3620"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3620"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3620"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
