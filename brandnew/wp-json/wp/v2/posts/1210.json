Somehow, after 68 years, the brand has resisted gentrification. While it feels like this institution has been franchised onto every block, in reality there are only several official locations which are in ferocious competition with other namesake brands who all aim to corner the hot dog culinary category including <a href=\"http:\/\/www.google.com\/images?um=1&#038;hl=en&#038;safe=off&#038;client=safari&#038;rls=en&#038;biw=1436&#038;bih=784&#038;tbs=isch%3A1&#038;sa=1&#038;q=gray%27s+papaya&#038;aq=f&#038;aqi=&#038;aql=&#038;oq=&#038;gs_rfai=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gray&#8217;s Papaya<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/nathansfamous.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nathan&#8217;s<\/a>, (not to mention street vendors or the Shake Shack.)

Several of the locations had been shut down for some health violations, which effects the context of the rebrand slightly, but also makes the &#8220;clean up&#8221; all the more resonant.<\/p>\n<p>In the symbol, the refreshed brand assets now use gravity, a great idea. The papaya guy is standing straight up, serving you a fatter hot dog, now with mustard and bigger drink. The wider smile and cheery eyes suggest friendly service. The elimination of makeup, dimples and eyebrows reinforce his stable mental state. Moreover, his crown is less sharp and somehow more welcoming. He is the servant and we are the queen.<\/p>\n<p>Surrounding elements such as the script which delivers happy aphorisms like &#8220;The Original&#8221; are also well integrated. The condensed gothic that hammers off healthy facts is a little less convincing than it may have been in the mid 20th century, but it gives everything a needed volume and organized chaos. The smartest part about this rebrand is the elimination of the clunky lettering and clever integration of existing signage elements into the logo.  It would be extraordinarily expensive and lazy to update this signage with a novel font. Moreover the neon letters are arguably the most iconic and functional asset&hellip; they draw you into the restaurant like a fly.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/papaya_king_1.jpg\" alt=\"Papaya King\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">The old sign uses a pestle shape which I suspect was conceived to suggest the healthy &#8220;vitamin packed&#8221; drinks. <\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/papaya_sign_orig.jpg\" alt=\"Papaya King\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Sign elevation from the 1960s, inspiration for the new lettering.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/papaya_newsign.jpg\" alt=\"Papaya King\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Integration of the pestle shape and redrawn neon letters.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/papaya_king_3.jpg\" alt=\"Papaya King\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">New signage and with old signage living happily together.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/papaya_king_web.jpg\" alt=\"Papaya King\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The first time I visited this place I was a tourist, the second time I was desperately hungry.
