Monotype had just released <a href=\"http:\/\/www.monotype.com\/libraries\/burlingame\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Burlingame<\/a> by Carl Crossgrove when we started working on this so we jumped on it for its rugged yet quirky personality.

We had the cool pattern and knew that we wanted to do a full coverage fabric instead of the usual small print area that most vendors allow for silkscreening. So we went to the source and had fabric silkscreened first and <em>then<\/em> turned into a tote bag. Yes, it was expensive (printing 5 spot colors will do that to ya): $8 per bag instead of the more typical $3 or $4 you would pay. To help us make this tote bag a reality we tapped our long-time supporter, MailChimp, for some additional financial support which they did and that&#8217;s why there is a chimp on the bag. (And because there is not enough chimps on stuff). The red shoulder strap also brought an extra oomph, while the gusset of the bag (the sides) are black for a respite from the pattern.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bnconf_2014_identity_tote_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2014 Brand New Conference by UnderConsideration\" style=\"margin-bottom:30px;\" \/><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bnconf_2014_identity_tote_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2014 Brand New Conference by UnderConsideration\" style=\"width:47%!important;margin-right:4%;margin-bottom:30px;\" \/><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bnconf_2014_identity_tote_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2014 Brand New Conference by UnderConsideration\" style=\"width:47%!important;margin-bottom:30px;\" \/><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bnconf_2014_identity_tote_04.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2014 Brand New Conference by UnderConsideration\" style=\"width:31.5%!important;margin-right:2%;\" \/><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bnconf_2014_identity_tote_05.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2014 Brand New Conference by UnderConsideration\" style=\"width:31.5%!important;margin-right:2%;\" \/><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bnconf_2014_identity_tote_06.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2014 Brand New Conference by UnderConsideration\" style=\"width:31.5%!important;\" \/>\n<figcaption>Tote bag.

Photos by Drew Rios.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Badges<\/h1>\n<p>Our initial idea of doing a thick rubber badge was scraped because industrial rubber stinks. So, as they say, we pivoted and went with a layered approach, using Neenah&#8217;s PLIKE paper which has a rubbery feel that made us feel better about foregoing the initial idea. The trick with badges is that whatever we did once, we would have to do 800 times over so in hindsight this multi-step, multi-piece badge was probably the worst approach but they turned out cool. Each badge consists of a red piece of PLIKE bound with a piece of custom tape to a white piece of PLIKE where we printed each attendee&#8217;s name and then trimmed with a &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bnconf_2014_identity_badges_wiggler.mov\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">wiggler<\/a>&#8220;; that lays on top of a gray piece of paper with the schedule for day one and has another piece of custom tape at the bottom; this one lays on top of a last sheet of black PLIKE with the schedule for day two. All those pieces of paper have to be punch-holed and placed on a string. So, yeah, that was a lot of work.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bnconf_2014_identity_badges_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2014 Brand New Conference by UnderConsideration\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bnconf_2014_identity_badges_01a.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2014 Brand New Conference by UnderConsideration\" \/>\n<figcaption>Badges.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bnconf_2014_identity_badges_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2014 Brand New Conference by UnderConsideration\" style=\"margin-bottom:30px;\" \/><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bnconf_2014_identity_badges_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2014 Brand New Conference by UnderConsideration\" style=\"width:47%!important;margin-right:4%;\" \/><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bnconf_2014_identity_badges_04.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2014 Brand New Conference by UnderConsideration\" style=\"width:47%!important;\" \/>\n<figcaption>All the different layers.

We realized the stage was huge and that it was going to feel a little desolate out there without anything on it. Our first idea of cobbling together &#8220;pixel&#8221; letters from cardboard boxes was shut down by the venue because they are a fire hazard. So, again, we pivoted! (I just love using that word). We had some yellow plexiglass left from last year&#8217;s badges and decided to give that material a try and generate laser-cut letters out of it. <a href=\"http:\/\/underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bnconf_2014_identity_letters_test.mov\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The first test was successful<\/a> and we ordered giant sheets of red plexi to have laser-cut at <a href=\"http:\/\/makeatx.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MakeATX<\/a>. <a href=\"http:\/\/underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bnconf_2014_identity_letters_file.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Check out the file<\/a> we sent to laser-cut to make sure we bought the least amount of plexi.<\/p>\n<p>Once cut we put basic Home Depot brackets behind the letters and fastened them with tape.

They sure learned their lesson. Probably went home and told their significant others, &#8220;You are <em>not<\/em> going to believe what I had to do today at work&#8221;.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bnconf_2014_identity_letters_process.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2014 Brand New Conference by UnderConsideration\" \/>\n<figcaption>Setting up the letters for kerning.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bnconf_2014_identity_letters_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for 2014 Brand New Conference by UnderConsideration\" \/>\n<figcaption>A long shot of the first pass.

When we start out with the logo in February or March we have no idea where we are going to end up, there is no master plan for the identity nor do we set a course for how things will come together, we just go element by element and start to build consistency and string ideas together as we go along with one thing influencing the next. It might not be the ideal workflow but we like this process that allows us to improvise (or freak out) as needed. We have a few months to not think about this so that we can start freaking out about what in the hell we&#8217;ll do for 2015.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Given the positive reception of last year&apos;s post about the design and development of the 2013 Brand New Conference identity I thought you fine people would enjoy another thorough overview of what we did for this year&apos;s conference in Chicago,&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[66,12,26],"tags":[248,540,769,309],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3531"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3531"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3531\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3531"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3531"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3531"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
