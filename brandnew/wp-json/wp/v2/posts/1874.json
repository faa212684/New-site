TFO has a dual focus on children programming as well as documentaries and other cultural programming for adults. The channel is now one component of the larger Groupe M&eacute;dia TFO, which produces web series and content for other partners. This February, TFO introduced a new identity designed by Toronto-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.loweroche.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lowe Roche<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>Retaining the brand heritage while modernizing its feel, the new logo has taken on the shape of a flag to symbolize TFO&#8217;s strong emotional connection with French-speaking Ontario. The visuals embrace a bold colour scheme that encompasses the corporate colour purple as well as red, blue and lime green. As TFO does not carry any commercials but does air self-promotion material, this bold spectrum was selected by Lowe Roche to help break up the visuals and identify TFO&#8217;s diverse cultural content, which includes opera and ballet, arthouse films, social magazines and children&#8217;s programming.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/glossyinc.com\/?p=8826\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lowe Roche Press Release<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tfo_logo_colors.gif\" alt=\"TFO\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Corporate and 25th anniversary logos in different color combinations.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/tfo_stationery.gif\" alt=\"TFO\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The previous logo was far too corporate-looking for a channel that catered to both children and adults and didn&#8217;t represent any kind of cultural bent. The new logo is still slightly ambiguous but the flag approach plays to a kind of national pride and it&#8217;s in application that the identity gathers some indie, cultural flavor. But first, the logo execution: As simple as it seems and with so few elements you would think it would be hard to get something wrong but that &#8220;TF&#8221; ligature is very unnatural and forced creating a very narrow counterspace when they were trying to solve the wider counterspace generated by the &#8220;T&#8221;. It&#8217;s not terrible and it took me a couple of glances at the logo to notice it but, once you do, it&#8217;s hard to keep your eyes off of it.<\/p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/38064389\" width=\"574\" height=\"323\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Summary of the complete identity.<\/p>\n<p>The on-air package is what makes this identity work. The use of heavy rules and repeating of the flag to highlight important words give it a restrained edgy look and, more impressively, those same elements work to frame both the adult and children programming (you can see the latter at the 0:50 mark in the video above). The logo animates in a couple of different ways on screen, sometimes it has a confusing peeling-sticker effect and other times it waves as the flag it&#8217;s meant to be. The peeling effect seems odd, but I guess it&#8217;s an easy effect to pull off, more than waving. The rest of the applications support the on-air look and add up to a nice redesign.<\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"574\" height=\"292\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/1OxmL4AOzmE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Launch party for the new identity.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.strategy.co.nz\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Caspian Ievers<\/a> for the tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_120309_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_120309_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_120309_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_120309_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_120309_config_03.xml&#038;xyz=poll_120309_votes_03.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv3\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv3\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,63,26],"tags":[150,340,290,476,42,189],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1874"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1874"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1874\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1874"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1874"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1874"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
