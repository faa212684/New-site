All data from the visits is logged digitally and any anomalies prompt a doctor visit. Based on this model where early action can save children&#8217;s lives, Djantoli has introduced a new identity designed by the Paris office of <a href=\"http:\/\/landor.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Landor<\/a> that reflects the number of lives it&#8217;s protecting.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>To better broadcast Djantoli&#8217;s simple but important mission, Landor created an engaging identity that evolves in real time: a mechanism that updates with every life protected. The identity&#8217;s typography includes a counter that displays part of the digit that preceded the final number, emphasizing Djantoli&#8217;s growing impact. The identity serves as a call to action; it invites people to get involved in increasing the number of lives protected.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/landor.com\/#!\/work\/case-studies\/djantoli\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Landor project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/djantoli_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Djantoli by Landor\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail with tagline &#8220;Because every life counts&#8221;.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>Landor ensured that keeping the identity current was a manageable process. After each consultation, doctors update their system, which then refreshes the identity across all digital platforms. The digital application is supported by a unique stamping system that allows employees to update their business cards with the new identity each time they exchange them.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/landor.com\/#!\/work\/case-studies\/djantoli\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Landor project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/djantoli_logo_idea.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Djantoli by Landor\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo concept.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/106416296?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=00bce4\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Identity presentation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The previous logo and name were&hellip; let&#8217;s just say not good. They didn&#8217;t trigger any emotional connection, although in real life and in the work they are doing what matters is the work, on the ground, but when it comes to raising money a lackluster name and identity can always be a hurdle for nonprofits. This new logo establishes a conversation immediately, even if you don&#8217;t know what the number, in mid-change, represents. It makes the person on the other end wonder what it&#8217;s about. The execution has a positive aesthetic with a friendly round sans serif while yellow adds a touch of caution. The simple, thin wordmark plays a secondary role and provides a good contrast to the big numbers.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/djantoli_business_cards.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Djantoli by Landor\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/djantoli_stamps.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Djantoli by Landor\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/djantoli_letterhead.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Djantoli by Landor\" \/>\n<figcaption>Letterhead (and smartphone screen).<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/djantoli_posters.jpg\" alt=\"New Name, Logo, and Identity for Djantoli by Landor\" \/>\n<figcaption>Posters.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">Updated online in real time, and slowly with stamps in analog applications, the identity makes a strong statement for the organization with each brand &#8220;impression&#8221;, something that most nonprofits struggle with (and why you see so many tagline-y NGO logos). Overall, from name change to committed application production, this is a great change for the organization that is also quite attractive and dynamic.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 2008 and originally named Pesinet (which was an acronym for Pes&eacute;e Infantile sur le Net, &#8220;Weigh the baby on the scale&#8221; in English), Djantoli, as it was renamed this past April (which means &#8220;carefully watch over&#8221; in Bambara&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,79,26],"tags":[179,202,172,530],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3583"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3583"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3583\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3583"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3583"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3583"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
