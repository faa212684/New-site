A non-profit organization with strong ties to the community, Cardinal Stage&#8217;s programming covers many genres, including musicals, dramas, classics, and, since 2010, kid-friendly and family-oriented productions. Its holiday show &#8212; whether it&#8217;s <em>Peter Pan<\/em>, <em>Mary Poppins<\/em>, or\u00a0<em>A Christmas Carol<\/em> &#8212; is a highlight\u00a0of Bloomington&#8217;s\u00a0end of year events. After 12 years, the theater&#8217;s founder and\u00a0artistic director relocated with this family and opened the door for Cardinal Stage to move into a new era, effectively referred to internally as &#8220;Cardinal 2.0&#8221;. One half of UnderConsideration (Armin) was invited to join the board of directors at the start of the 2017 &#8211; 18 season and soon after we began working with the staff (including the new artistic director) on redesigning their identity to signal the evolution of Cardinal Stage. First previewed at their annual gala event in March, the new identity launched this May along with their 2018 &#8211; 19 season announcement. The project &#8212; including the logo redesign, new identity, and full range of season materials &#8212;\u00a0was done pro-bono by <a href-=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">UnderConsideration<\/a> (that&#8217;s us).<\/p>\n<!--more--><p><span class=\"red\">Nota bene:<\/span> Under normal circumstances, given the size of the client, this project would have been posted in the Noted section if it had not been designed by us. It is posted in the Reviewed section NOT because it was designed by us nor because we think it&#8217;s the greatest thing on Earth but because we wanted to put ourselves in the same, relatively high-visibility situation I put Reviewed projects in. This project is, in no way, offered as a &#8220;This is how it&#8217;s done&#8221; but as &#8220;This is how we do it&#8221;. This isn&#8217;t meant to be used as a self-promotion effort either of using our own platform to push our own work but many times in the comments, over the years, the question has been raised of &#8220;where&#8217;s the reviewer&#8217;s work?&#8221; and, as most of you know, we don&#8217;t do a lot of design work for clients &#8212; in fact, this is the first significant identity project we&#8217;ve done in the last nine years (outside of the temporal identity projects for the Brand New Conference), so here is the reviewer&#8217;s (and his partner&#8217;s) work.

Its main drawback was a lack of consistency in how they used their logo &#8212;\u00a0of which they had three different versions\u00a0(that would sometimes be used side by side) &#8212; and that their materials were sometimes too literal (i.e., an initiative called &#8220;Nest Generation&#8221; showed an overly cute bird&#8217;s nest even though the initiative was geared toward 20- to 35-year-olds). One thing that has impressed us about the theater is how they are able to give their own interpretation, on the production side (through fantastic sets),\u00a0to existing plays and we felt that that was missing in how they presented themselves, by being less literal and also having an element of joy and surprise.<\/p>\n<p>We knew we had to keep the cardinal bird in some form &#8212; after all, it was not only part of the name but they had built enough equity into a cardinal icon that it would not have been appropriate to completely ditch it. Also, the cardinal is the official state bird of Indiana so there are a lot of cardinal-themed and cardinal-named businesses here and we wanted to make sure that theirs stood out. In analyzing the cardinal, we found a few key physical features that make it iconic:<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Cardinal_Stage_Case_Study_03a_Bird_Shape.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>The distinctive features of cardinal birds.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Based on those observations, we abstracted the cardinal using only circles and triangles and then worked it out so that we could embed it in the negative space of a &#8220;C&#8221; (for &#8220;Cardinal&#8221;) as an element of surprise that, as we&#8217;ve found, brings a moment of joy to those who didn&#8217;t see it at first glance.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Cardinal_Stage_Case_Study_03b_Logo_Animation_Explanation.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Cardinal Stage by UnderConsideration\" \/>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The name of the organization fit nicely in the wide space over the bird and yielded some pleasant alignments (like the two &#8220;A&#8221;s and &#8220;D&#8221; and &#8220;E&#8221;). Having an icon and wordmark contained as a badge, allows the logo to be flexible and effective in its use and placement.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Cardinal_Stage_Case_Study_03c_Logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Cardinal Stage by UnderConsideration\" \/>\n<figcaption>Badge configuration.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Cardinal_Stage_Case_Study_04a_Logo_Structure.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Cardinal Stage by UnderConsideration\" \/>\n<figcaption>Underlying grid &#8212; not gratuitous!

On the right: cover for the season announcement brochure.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>One of the things that we were most concerned about were the graphics for each show where, for the past 5 or 7 years, every show looked completely different and there was no cohesiveness between any of them, making it really difficult for the graphics to help tell the audience that this was a Cardinal Stage show and not one of their competitor&#8217;s. In the past they had relied on everything from licensed logos and imagery to customized versions of things found online to some original concepts. The problem, of course, is finding an approach that is appropriate across different genres for different audiences and one that doesn&#8217;t feel overly repetitive or constrictive.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Cardinal_Stage_Case_Study_14_Old_Show_Graphics.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Cardinal Stage by UnderConsideration\" \/>\n<figcaption>Artwork and title treatments for the 2017 &#8211; 18 season shows.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Although our system-implementing inclinations wanted to standardize the type treatments and make them more &#8220;design-y&#8221;, our Cardinal Stage clients were clear (and correct) in that that wasn&#8217;t going to work and that the title treatments needed to be quickly evocative of the genre so that as many people as possible would instantly get what type of play they were going to see. We did establish a standard where the type treatments can only be in black and white and from there we let loose with some fun title treatments. As much as possible, we selected free Google Fonts or affordable choices from Creative Market in order to minimize font licensing costs.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Cardinal_Stage_Case_Study_14_Show_Titles.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Cardinal Stage by UnderConsideration\" \/>\n<figcaption>Title treatments for the 2018 &#8211; 19 shows.<br \/><span style=\"opacity:.5\"><em>Disney&#8217;s Beauty and the Beast<\/em> is presented through special arrangement with Music Theatre International (MTI).

The backgrounds of each illustrations have strong diagonal elements to evoke the 45-degree angle of the logo while the texturing helped unify the six shows of the season.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Cardinal_Stage_Case_Study_15_Show_Illustrations.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Cardinal Stage by UnderConsideration\" \/>\n<figcaption>Illustrations for the shows.
