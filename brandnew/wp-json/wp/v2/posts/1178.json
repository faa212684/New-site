Its mission is &#8220;to provide support to arts and cultural organizations and to unite and coordinate arts efforts in northeast Indiana.&#8221; Arts United also manages <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/gravitymachine\/sets\/72157623587507578\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the Arts United Center, built in 1973 by Louis Kahn<\/a> and serves as the main performing space for the Civic Theatre, the Youtheatre, Fort Wayne Ballet, Fort Wayne Dance Collective and the Fort Wayne Philharmonic. This month, Arts United introduced a new logo designed by local Fort Wayne agency <a href=\"http:\/\/oneluckyguitar.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">One Lucky Guitar<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>&#8220;You might say we&#8217;re getting out of the box and moving in a new direction. We want our logo to demonstrate the collaborative nature of our mission to enrich the community by making arts and culture a vital part of our lifestyle. We&#8217;re excited about our new look.&#8221;<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.artsunited.org\/files\/press%20release%20new%20logo.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press Release (PDF)<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/arts_united_bizcards.jpg\" alt=\"Arts United\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As corny as it sounds to say that the new logo gets out of the box, it indeed does so literally as well as attitudinally. The old logo was very serious and artsy, with that <em>Avatar<\/em>-meets-Roman-inscription lettering in the 1980s blue box motif. The new one breaks away nicely from those limited constraints and creates a lively shape that speaks to collaboration and integration. The monogram is simple, easy to read, and has a very nice dimensionality that does not rely on shading to convey its volume. The loosely spaced Neutraface type gives it a little mid-century artistic flavor that contrasts well with the rounded monogram above. The logo works very well too in inverse, as the business cards above show and it&#8217;s also surprising how good it looks against the bright orange background in the image below. Overall, a very strong and fresh update.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/arts_united_banner.jpg\" alt=\"Arts United\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to Jon Swerens for the tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_100823_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_100823_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_100823_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_100823_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,79,26],"tags":[40,306,42],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1178"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1178"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1178\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1178"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1178"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1178"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
