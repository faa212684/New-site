One of the aspects that makes ob\u00e9 different is its studio: a large lightbox with walls, ceiling, and floor that shift through a range of pastel colors as the class progresses. This live gradient has been translated into physical applications by Mexico City-based Futura through iridescent papers, surfaces, and foil stamping, giving the otherwise simple geometric sans serif logo more vibrancy. The presentation of the project is like <em>TRON<\/em> meets <em>Flashdance<\/em> and all I want to do right now is put on a sweatband and jazzercise like a maniac. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/byfutura.com\/project\/obe\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Oleson Sales by Werner Design Werks<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_oleson.jpg\" alt=\"Oleson Sales by Werner Design Werks\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">Oleson Sales is the business of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/johnoleson\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">John Oleson<\/a>, an electrical engineer with an extensive background in sales and client services, specializing in electronical equipment sales. The identity, designed by Saint Paul, MN-based <a href=\"http:\/\/wdw.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Werner Design Werks<\/a>, is minimalist but packs a big punch with the use of yellow paper in as many applications as possible, giving the simple and elegant sans serif a big boost. The diacritical marks allude to John&#8217;s Scandinavian heritage and, placed over the &#8220;O&#8221;s, it then lead to a smiling face icon using the &#8220;O&#8221;s with diacritical eyebrows flanking the &#8220;L&#8221; for the nose. If I were in the market for electronical equipment I would totally ring up Mr. Oleson. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/wdw.com\/projects\/oleson\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">48North Cannabis Corp. by Blok Design<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_48north.jpg\" alt=\"48North Cannabis Corp. by Blok Design\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/48nrth.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">48North Cannabis Corp.<\/a> is &#8220;building a vertically-integrated cannabis company to be a global leader in formulation, production and distribution of next generation cannabis-infused products [&#8230;] on track to deliver to the female health and wellness cannabis market through the development and manufacturing of products and brands.&#8221; So: Cannabis + Women + Booming Cannabis Market of Canada.

It&#8217;s all a very nice combination of elements that sets 48North as a sophisticated, considerate player in this growing industry. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/68582547\/48North\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"A range of geometric sans serif logos spruced up through color this week, with work from Mexico City, St. Paul, and Toronto&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[36,11,75,26],"tags":[1341,186,1556],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6752"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=6752"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6752\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=6752"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=6752"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=6752"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
