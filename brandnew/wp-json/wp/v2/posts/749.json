It&#8217;s also been one of the easiest, friendliest and most accessible for designers and non-designers alike with its simple and ample tag references and categories. But for all its usability features, the design, well, sucked. With vast apologies to the original designer, but the look and feel of the web site (original <a href=\"http:\/\/www.myfonts.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a>), the logo and all the related typography and visuals felt more appropriate to Chuck E. Cheese than a type reseller. First introduced in print materials at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.typecon.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TypeCon<\/a> this past July, MyFonts unveiled a new logo, and this past month launched a beta version of its web site.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/myfonts_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"MyFonts Logo, Detail\" \/><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.underware.nl\/site2\/index.php?id1=underware&#038;id2=case-studies&#038;id3=03\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Designed by Underware<\/a> in the Netherlands, the new logo (or wordmark to be more specific) tackles a rather challenging task: Which typeface do you use for a company that represents thousands of them? Simply, you don&#8217;t. The custom lettering approach is just exactly what MyFonts needed, as it stands for a representation of the craft of creating letters and who better to do it than the crafty folks of Underware. <\/p>\n<blockquote>The new MyFonts logotype is made with a broom instead of a brush. It has a secret bonus for those who get it, but still functions as a contemporary hand-painted logo for those who don&#8217;t. As any detailed explanation would ruin the magic, we&#8217;ll leave it at that.<\/blockquote>\n<p>After working most of last night into the wee hours I can&#8217;t really figure out what this &#8220;secret bonus&#8221; is, so anyone that wants to entertain the challenge, go ahead. The logo also serves as a handsome punctuation mark in a remarkably amazing upgrade of the web site, which is simple, useful and pretty to look at. This is a great redesign to satisfy some of the most stringent users online: Us.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Thanks to all who sent in the tip.
