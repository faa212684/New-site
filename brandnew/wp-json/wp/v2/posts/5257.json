Today it offers its services through six different consumer brands in different territories: Beeline in Russia, Kyivstar in Ukraine, Wind in Italy and Greece, Djezzy in Algeria, Mobilink in Pakistan, and Banglalink in Bangladesh. Renamed by <a href=\"https:\/\/landor.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Landor<\/a>, VEON recently introduced a new identity designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/movingbrands.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Moving Brands<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/veon_brands.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for VEON by Moving Brands\" \/>\n<figcaption>VEON&#8217;s consumer brands.

For a new business that needed to meet and connect with an audience of millions across 12 different markets, this confident symbol would work across cultures and alphabets.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/movingbrands.com\/work\/veon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Moving Brands project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/jisBfb6SBw4\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Before to after logo animations.

Without the &#8220;bee&#8221; in the name (and possibly without knowing they owned Beeline), the VimpelCom logo made little sense as it was a random name with a randomly striped logo. The new name is still random &#8212; no explanation found on what the new moniker means &#8212; but, admittedly, less random than VimpelCom which sounded like a company set by a Winklevoss twin. VEON is shorter and more memorable, a little like a fictional evil company in a movie, a feeling enhanced by the superhero-like &#8220;V&#8221;. It&#8217;s a nice &#8220;V&#8221; and it&#8217;s big and yellow; its size might be the approach that saves it from passing unperceived and the applications show how effective it can be in playing with scale. The wordmark is decent; I like how the &#8220;V&#8221; and &#8220;O&#8221; are a square proportion while the &#8220;E&#8221; and &#8220;N&#8221; are less wide. For how big the &#8220;V&#8221; is used, it tends to make the wordmark look tiny and perhaps some extra letter-spacing would have been beneficial.<\/p>\n<blockquote>[The] VEON typeface &#8211; Hero &#8211; was chosen not only for clarity and standout, but also for its versatility. It remains unmistakably VEON in Latin, Cyrillic and Georgian alphabets.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/movingbrands.com\/work\/veon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Moving Brands project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/veon_typography.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for VEON by Moving Brands\" \/>\n<figcaption>Proprietary typeface.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/veon_stationery.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for VEON by Moving Brands\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stationery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/veon_sales_materials.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for VEON by Moving Brands\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sales materials.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/veon_annual_report.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for VEON by Moving Brands\" \/>\n<figcaption>Annual report.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/veon_ads.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for VEON by Moving Brands\" \/>\n<figcaption>Ads.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/veon_ads_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for VEON by Moving Brands\" \/>\n<figcaption>More ads.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The applications are quite striking and hard to ignore, with the giant yellow &#8220;V&#8221;s demanding attention.
