Refueling on the go isn&#8217;t an indulgence but a basic human need. And so we created a concept around not feeling bad about eating between meals. Real ingredients and mouthwatering taste. Simply put say yes to snacking!\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b<\/blockquote><h3>Snask project page<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/get_raw_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Get Raw by Snask\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo got the point across that the product was unconventional with the wacky typography but when paired with the monster illustrations perhaps it started to skew towards looking like a kid treat instead of an adult snack. The new logo communicates rawness in a more straightforward way, with an energetic, hand-drawn, marker gesture that results in a slightly punk but still very much reigned in aesthetic that hits a nice balance. The penmanship (or markership) of the logo is pretty nice with each letter having some cool traits of their own and working together as a slick lettering unit. The only small part I would have fixed is the last long stroke of the &#8220;W&#8221; that got a little wobbly but I also appreciate they didn&#8217;t perfect it all too much to keep that&#8230; raw feeling.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/get_raw_identity_elements.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Get Raw by Snask\" \/>\n<figcaption>Identity elements.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/get_raw_stationery.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Get Raw by Snask\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stationery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/get_raw_posters.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Get Raw by Snask\" \/>\n<figcaption>Posters.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The scribble elements are okay and they pair well with the sans serif.
