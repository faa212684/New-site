They are the only club to have spent their entire history in the top flight of Italian football, known as Serie A, which started in 1929-1930. Internazionale have won 30 domestic trophies, including the league 18 times, the Coppa Italia seven times and the Supercoppa Italiana five times. From 2006 to 2010, the club won five successive league titles, equalling the all-time record. They have won the Champions League three times: two back-to-back in 1964 and 1965 and then another in 2010, the last completed an unprecedented (for an Italian team) continental treble with the Coppa Italia and the Scudetto. The club has also won three UEFA Cups, two Intercontinental Cups and one FIFA Club World Cup.&#8221; (Source: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Inter_Milan\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wikipedia<\/a>)<\/p><!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/inter_milan_logo_photo.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Football Club Internazionale Milano by Leftloft\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/inter_milan_logo_photo_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Football Club Internazionale Milano by Leftloft\" \/>\n<figcaption>The logo IRL.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/inter_milan_new_kit.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Football Club Internazionale Milano by Leftloft\" \/>\n<figcaption>The new kit.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"(Est. 1908) &quot;Football Club Internazionale Milano, commonly referred to as Internazionale or simply Inter, and colloquially known as Inter Milan outside of Italy, is a professional Italian football club based in Milan, Lombardy.
