In the meantime, we can all look forward to the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil by enjoying the officially released emblem, designed by Brazilian agency <a href=\"http:\/\/www.africa.com.br\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Africa<\/a>, after 25 agencies were invited to submit proposals and be judged by Brazilian Football Confederation chairman Ricardo Teixeira, FIFA executive secretary J&eacute;r&ocirc;me Valcke, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.boston.com\/ae\/celebrity\/articles\/2010\/07\/10\/gisele_picks_logo_shops_with_tom\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>supermodel Gisele B&uuml;ndchen<\/em><\/a>, architect Oscar Niemeyer, writer Paulo Coelho, singer Ivete Sangalo, and designer Hans Donner. The logo <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fifa.com\/worldcup\/brazil2014\/news\/newsid=1270849.html#brazil+2014+taking+shape\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">was unveiled last week in Johannesburg<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>The winning design was &#8220;Inspiration&#8221;, created by Brazilian agency Africa. The design stems from an iconic photograph of three victorious hands together raising the world&#8217;s most famous trophy. As well as depicting the humanitarian notion of hands interlinking, the portrayal of the hands is also symbolic of the yellow and green of Brazil warmly welcoming the world to their country.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fifa.com\/worldcup\/brazil2014\/media\/newsid=1270440.html#journey+brazil+2014+begins\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press Release<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<object width=\"480\" height=\"385\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/7flXuaZhiA4&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1\"><\/param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"><\/param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"><\/param><embed src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/7flXuaZhiA4&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1\" type=\"application\/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"480\" height=\"385\"><\/embed><\/object>\n<p>Most commentary of the new logo has been negative since it was first &#8220;leaked&#8221; in late May after FIFA registered the logo with <a href=\"http:\/\/oami.europa.eu\/ows\/rw\/pages\/index.en.do\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">OHIM<\/a>, the Trade Marks and Designs Registration Office of the European Union. Most critics are right in that the logo is crude in its execution, so I may one of the sole voices that finds something fresh about it, or at least the concept behind it. Building the trophy out of hands embracing it is a great depiction of the spirit of the World Cup, but the execution here is heavily lacking; the &#8220;style&#8221; is right, something natural and exaggerated, but it probably needs to be in the hands (pun!) of a more masterful illustrator. The same could be said of the &#8220;Brasil&#8221; lettering, it&#8217;s almost there but a little too unrefined.<\/p>\n<p>However, if four years ago we had shown you the 2010 World Cup logo, everyone would have probably hated it, but after experiencing the contagious excitement of the World Cup, the logo becomes a representation of that and we forget how good or bad it may be in execution.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to Mauricio Fontinele for first tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_100714_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_100714_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_100714_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_100714_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,26,87],"tags":[146,251,39,252],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1148"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1148"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1148\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1148"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1148"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1148"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
