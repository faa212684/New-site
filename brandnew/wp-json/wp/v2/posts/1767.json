From there, the watches&#8217; display got more abstract and playful and with more success and recognition, Nooka has grown into a full brand of products, from the original watches to belts, wallets, eyewear, and even fragrance. Nooka has a bit of a funky new-agey philosophy, i.e., &#8220;Creates physical manifestations of ideas&#8221;, or &#8220;Promotes universal communication via the form and visual language of fashion and design&#8221; or &#8220;Brings a techno-progressivist set of expectations to the world of ordinary objects.&#8221; A little too frou-frou for me, but I&#8217;ll bite, because sometimes the world can do with less serious things. The in-house design team at Nooka has just completed an identity redesign.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>Since its launch in 2004, the Nooka logo has been increasing in boldness for reasons of legibility. Unlike most corporate logos in which the artwork needs to be legible at 25mm, the Nooka logo needs to be legible at about half that, sometimes less. The solution was two-fold. One&#8211;to increase boldness for maximum legibility both small and large sizes, and two&#8211;to simplify the letterforms to better express our ethos. Along with these changes, subtle details were also introduced to make the Nooka logotype more visually pleasing.<br \/><br \/>Aside from the increase in weight, the infinity sign remains a constant in our visual identity &mdash; representing the infinite possibilities the future has to offer. We introduced rounded corners on both the &#8220;N&#8221; and &#8220;A&#8221; to compliment this shape. The top of the &#8220;N&#8221; has a 90 degree corner that juxtaposes the round corners and calls point of entry to begin reading the logo. The simplification of the &#8220;A&#8221; by removing the cross-bar is meant to evoke a future beyond the planet earth.<br \/>Description provided by Nooka<\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nooka_01.jpg\" alt=\"Nooka\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The old logo was a pretty adequate execution, with a readable infinity symbol standing in for the double &#8220;o&#8221;s, perhaps a little too bland in taste, but since it lived on such cool products, it could afford its simplicity. The new logo is a good evolution with more visual purpose. The bolder weight looks much better than the previous lighter weight and the &#8220;KA&#8221; ligature is much better resolved. The crossbar-less &#8220;A&#8221; is a little NASA-ish, but it&#8217;s fitting to the space-y product designs. The rest of the identity is very nicely executed and super sophisticated yet contemporary and bold. Overall, a great nudge into a better fashion and lifestyle brand.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nooka_02.jpg\" alt=\"Nooka\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">&#8220;In place of cumbersome guidelines, we developed a poster which can be distributed digitally as an interactive pdf and can be printed at large ISO sizes. Each image on the pdf is a direct download for all basic brand assets&#8211;such as logo, typeface, stationary&#8211;to use on their own.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nooka_03a.jpg\" alt=\"Nooka\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nooka_04.jpg\" alt=\"Nooka\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">&#8220;Nooka is a global brand. Our products &mdash; through wide distribution &mdash; must maintain a consistent brand image. We eliminated our existing bulky packaging and introduced a sleek, mylar bag. These mylar bags come in three sizes &mdash; which allow universal use for a multitude of products. In addition to eliminating bulk, we stopped using acrylic stands for our watches. Instead we introduced corrugated cardboard pieces which ship flat&#8211;and fold when needed to display our watches.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nooka_03.jpg\" alt=\"Nooka\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Nooka is a global brand, with a growing number of distributors, business relationships and retailers worldwide. Much thought went into how we can create a system that can function in multiple regions yet maintain Nooka identity. The solution was to stamp paper blanks which could later be customized upon requests.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nooka_05.jpg\" alt=\"Nooka\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nooka_06.jpg\" alt=\"Nooka\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nooka_07.jpg\" alt=\"Nooka\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">&#8220;The Nooka system is created of paper stock with our logo stamped in silver foil. The branded stock allows us to create any changes that occur with moving, adding people, different office locations, etc.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nooka_08.jpg\" alt=\"Nooka\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nooka_09.jpg\" alt=\"Nooka\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/nooka_10.jpg\" alt=\"Nooka\" \/><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_120102_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_120102_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_120102_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_120102_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,51,26],"tags":[45,580,100,42],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1767"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1767"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1767\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1767"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1767"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1767"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
