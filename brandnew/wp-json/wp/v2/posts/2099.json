Sugarpova will be sold at fashion store Henri Bendel in New York, available at hotel minibars, and at their own website. The new logo and packaging was designed by Brooklyn, NY-based <a href=\"http:\/\/redantler.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Red Antler<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sugarpova_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"Sugarpova Logo and Packaging\" \/><\/p>\n<blockquote>Sugarpova brings a new level of sophistication and quality to the gummy candy market, without losing sight of the playful nature of the product. The brand needed to communicate this balance by being fashionable, fresh and fun, just like Maria. We designed a unique lip shape that can be altered to convey the many attitudes of the brand &mdash; chic, cheeky, silly, sassy, flirty, quirky, spooky, and smitten &mdash; corresponding with different shapes and flavors of the gummies themselves.<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/redantler.com\/work\/sugarpova\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Red Antler case study<\/a> <\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sugarpova_packaging.jpg\" alt=\"Sugarpova Logo and Packaging\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sugarpova_pattern.gif\" alt=\"Sugarpova Logo and Packaging\" \/><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s hard not to like this identity and packaging in the same way that it&#8217;s hard not to like gummy candy. It&#8217;s fun and vibrant and colorful. And everything about it matches in personality and attitude: from the pun-y name of the product to the shapes of the gummies to their names to the faces and dresses worn by Sharapova in promoting it. None of it is my own personal flavor and I am far from the intended audience but I can see a product and brand on target when I see one. Technically, everything is pretty well done too. The icon is catchy and graphic without turning too cartoon-y and the typography is playful and sophisticated with only one minor flair in the elongated &#8220;R&#8221; to give it some distinction. The patterns in the lips are the one element that I feel could have been executed better or, if not better, at least more interestingly &mdash; there is very little separating the wave pattern of &#8220;Splashy&#8221; from what you would see on a billboard for an middle-of-nowhere water amusement park. Overall, it&#8217;s a strong debut for what is otherwise overpriced candy &mdash; although I have to admit, I&#8217;m curious about those tennis ball gummies.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sugarpova_all_with_her.jpg\" alt=\"Sugarpova Logo and Packaging\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sugarpova_one_with_her.jpg\" alt=\"Sugarpova Logo and Packaging\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sugarpova_store_launch_00.jpg\" alt=\"Sugarpova Logo and Packaging\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">At the launch on Henri Bendel in New York.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/sugarpova_store_launch_01.jpg\" alt=\"Sugarpova Logo and Packaging\" \/><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_120827_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_120827_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_120827_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_120827_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[51,12,26],"tags":[701,617,53,769,375],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2099"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2099"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2099\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2099"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2099"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2099"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
