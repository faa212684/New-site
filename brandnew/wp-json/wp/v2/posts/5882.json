It later absorbed the American Oil Company, founded in Baltimore in 1910 and incorporated in 1922 by Louis Blaustein and his son Jacob. Amoco merged with British Petroleum in December 1998, forming BP Amoco. Shortly after the merger, Amoco stations began a rebranding that saw the stations change their names to the BP marque while continuing to sell Amoco-branded fuel. Eventually all traces of the Amoco brand name were eliminated and the stations adopted the BP branding permanently, although Amoco&#8217;s grade naming system is still in use. In October 2017, BP revealed that it will be reintroducing the Amoco name to select US markets.&#8221; (<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Amoco\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wikipedia<\/a>)<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/amoco_logo.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Amoco\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/amoco_station_render_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Amoco\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/amoco_station_render_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo for Amoco\" \/>\n<figcaption>Station renders.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"(Est. 1889, retired 2004) &quot;Amoco Corporation, originally Standard Oil Company (Indiana), was a global chemical and oil company that was founded in 1889 around a refinery located in Whiting, Indiana, United States.
