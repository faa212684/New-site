PricewaterhouseCoopers definitely and I&#8217;d say Verizon. Although we can&#8217;t completely blame Landor, they created the Verizon name and most of the logo in 2000. Well, Verizon must have been happy, because after 6 years, Verizon came back and asked Landor to create a name and logo for a spinoff of their directories business. The result is Idearc.<\/p><!--more--><p>From the <a href=\"http:\/\/sev.prnewswire.com\/computer-electronics\/20061018\/NYW10318102006-1.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Press Release:<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Idearc was selected as the new company&#8217;s name to differentiate it from other publishers in the industry. A combination of the words &#8220;idea&#8221; and &#8220;arc,&#8221; Idearc symbolizes how the company connects buyers and sellers through robust content available across multiple media.<\/p>\n<p>Idearc&#8217;s logo incorporates the name with three, interconnected arcs that each tie to facets of Idearc&#8217;s strategic portfolio: Gray links with its print product design, green to its industry-leading SuperPages.com service, and blue to the future. Idearc&#8217;s name and logo were created by Landor Associates, the branding and design consultancy that also created the Verizon name and logo in 2000.&#8221;<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":14,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,26,89],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/451"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/14"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=451"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/451\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=451"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=451"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=451"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
