(* Delta Gamma refers to itself as a fraternity instead of a sorority.) Their Greek letters were chosen by the three young women who founded the fraternity in Oxford, Mississippi, at the Lewis School for Girls when they were unable to go home for the Christmas break, because of their desire to &#8220;Do Good&#8221;, which remains their motto today. In 1951, the Delta Gamma Foundation, a nonprofit organization, was formed to support fundraising, scholarships, programming and grants and specifically to help the visually impaired and other organizations that promote sight preservation and conservation. This month, Delta Gamma introduced a new identity designed by Columbus, OH-based <a href=\"https:\/\/ologie.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ologie<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>The Delta Gamma identity represents us visually at the most basic level. It&#8217;s a signature, a stamp of quality, and a symbol of pride for all of us to rally behind.<br \/><br \/>The brand mark is a combination of elements that are unique to Delta Gamma. It represents timelessness and pride, and is deeply rooted in our fraternity&#8217;s history.<br \/><br \/>The wordmark is a distinctive graphic treatment of our name. It&#8217;s usually positioned alongside the brand mark to create a recognizable logo for our brand.<\/blockquote><h3>Delta Gamma Brand Guidelines<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/delta_gamma_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Delta Gamma by Ologie\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/delta_gamma_logo_colors_and_lockups.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Delta Gamma by Ologie\" \/>\n<figcaption>Lock-up variations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/delta_gamma_logo_colors.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Delta Gamma by Ologie\" \/>\n<figcaption>Color variations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The first question that might come to mind, is why an anchor? It was adopted in 1877 as a symbol for hope. The second question that might come to mind, is why hope? It&#8217;s one of the values of the fraternity and their original pin featured a letter &#8220;H&#8221;. So&#8230; The old logo depicted the anchor in a rather mundane way, looking like a random marina or seafood restaurant and accompanied by painfully obvious fake small caps with the &#8220;D&#8221; and the &#8220;G&#8221; far too bold in contrast to the smaller uppercase letters. The new logo is a lovely and much needed evolution that not just adds sophistication but brings it into the academic world. The anchor is now more minimal and instead of the rope as a garnish it features the Greek letters filling in the counterspaces quite well and supported by a minimal rose graphic that follows the contour of the anchor. The wordmark is set in a very nice serif &#8212; <strike>ID help, please<\/strike> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.myfonts.com\/fonts\/fontfont\/milo-serif\/?refby=ucllc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FF Milo Serif<\/a> &#8212; that looks book-ish and contemporary. The year at the bottom is probably not needed but it does create a good balance with the anchor. Overall, the logo manages to feel feminine, strong, and confident without being heavy-handed about any of those aspects.<\/p>\n<blockquote>Our color palette is bold and distinctive. It relies primarily on our heritage colors of blue and pink, along with generous white space. Secondary colors are used for deeper levels of content in layouts and for breaking up headlines. By leaning on our heritage colors and plenty of white space, we create a modern look that still connects with our tradition.<\/blockquote><h3>Delta Gamma Brand Guidelines<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/delta_gamma_color_palette.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Delta Gamma by Ologie\" \/>\n<figcaption>Color palette.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The eagle, rose, and pillar badges represent our three entities: fraternity, Foundation, and Housing.<\/blockquote><h3>Delta Gamma Brand Guidelines<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/delta_gamma_badges.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Delta Gamma by Ologie\" \/>\n<figcaption>Badges.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/delta_gamma_typography.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Delta Gamma by Ologie\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/delta_gamma_typography_combos.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Delta Gamma by Ologie\" \/>\n<figcaption>Typography.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The rose is an iconic symbol of our fraternity that&#8217;s deeply rooted in our heritage.
