What that means, if I am copy-pasting correctly, is that it &#8220;connects  the biggest and most respected brands on the planet with their customers by providing  customer care, technical support, customer acquisition, digital solutions, analytics, back-office and other specialized services to ensure consistently positive customer interactions&#8221;. The company operates in 76 countries and has 223,000 &#8220;interaction experts&#8221;. Recently, Teleperformance introduced a new identity designed by S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.anacouto.com.br\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ana Couto<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>From an intense strategic study, we have created a new positioning, a new tagline that reinforces your leadership role and your true belief: each interaction matters.<br \/><br \/>We translate Teleperformance&#8217;s adaptability &#8211; to every customer, every culture and every person &#8211; reinforcing your personality at every point of contact, making every connection a unique opportunity to bring together brands and consumers.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.anacouto.com.br\/cases\/teleperformance\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ana Couto project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/teleperformance_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Teleperformance by Ana Couto\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/teleperformance_logo_icon_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Teleperformance by Ana Couto\" \/>\n<figcaption>Monogram detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/teleperformance_logo_icon_colors.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Teleperformance by Ana Couto\" \/>\n<figcaption>Color variations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo was so bad it was kind of amazing. The abstracted profile of a person wearing a headset over a globe was as cheesy as it gets but it was very convincingly done. The heavy typography in the heavy-ass blue box was, um, heavy. You get the point, it was bad. Especially for a company this size, whom other companies are supposed to trust their own customers with. I wouldn&#8217;t have. The monogram in the new logo is kind of confusing at first glance but it&#8217;s a very interesting way to create a monogram. I&#8217;m not saying it&#8217;s the most clever or the coolest but it&#8217;s definitely intriguing, unexpected, and, in a way, original.<\/p>\n<p>A hard shadow &#8220;P&#8221; helps outline a &#8220;T&#8221; in the negative space through a nice, simple execution. It could have easily been done without the gradient or, assuming that the gradient was a must, it should have been rendered with its direction at 45 degrees to match the direction of the shadow. The monogram, as seen in the applications below, then does some funky stuff by allowing the shadow to extend in straight and curvy paths which is another unexpected move in this system. The wordmark is bland and clunky but with such a long, single-word name the options are limited. Perhaps not making it black would have helped. In the guidelines below you can see a variation where the wordmark can be broken in three lines, which&#8230; no.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/teleperformance_guidelines.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Teleperformance by Ana Couto\" \/>\n<figcaption>Guidelines.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/teleperformance_messaging_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Teleperformance by Ana Couto\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/teleperformance_messaging_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Teleperformance by Ana Couto\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/teleperformance_messaging_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Teleperformance by Ana Couto\" \/>\n<figcaption>Messaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>This project totally need a little motion reel of the &#8220;TP&#8221; monogram extending and contracting and going in straight lines and curvy paths, but I guess static JPGs will have to do. The concept is interesting and it supports the new brand positioning of &#8220;Each interaction matters&#8221; as a way to visualize two elements interacting in different ways and connecting them no matter how far they are. The executions are almost spot-on but I think they are missing one more round of pushing the idea further and of refining. As it moves into applications, things take a turn for the cheesy with photography that looks heavily like stock and typography that&#8217;s too much of a techie clich\u00e9 but it&#8217;s not bad, just a little generic.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/teleperformance_business_cards.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Teleperformance by Ana Couto\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/teleperformance_social_media.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Teleperformance by Ana Couto\" \/>\n<figcaption>Social media.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/teleperformance_ad_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Teleperformance by Ana Couto\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/teleperformance_ad_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Teleperformance by Ana Couto\" \/>\n<figcaption>Ads.
