After some rocky seasons, the last one as the Road Warriors was their best and under new(ish) ownership since 2012, the team is looking to get fans more involved. The Road Warriors were presumably named to appeal to the 150 automotive-related companies that have chosen Upstate South Carolina to set up business but that wasn&#8217;t too attractive. The new name takes after a railroad nicknamed &#8220;Swamp Rabbit&#8221; by locals (see quote below). Actual <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Swamp_rabbit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">swamp rabbits<\/a> are also local to South Carolina. The new team logos were designed by San Diego, CA-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.brandiose.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brandiose<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>First known as the Carolina, Knoxville and Western line, and later becoming the Greenville and Northern railroad, the intent of the railroad was to connect Greenville with the rich coal fields of Tennessee, providing the Carolinas with a direct line over the mountains and access to cheaper coal. The railroad received its nickname, the &#8220;Swamp Rabbit&#8221; by locals who would use the freight train as a means of transportation to picnic in northern Greenville County. Completion of the rail line proved to be more of a financial commitment than expected, leaving the project at a halt near the foot of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Today you can find this railroad marker located beside the &#8220;Swamp Rabbit&#8221; Pedestrian Bridge, which crosses over the Reedy River just off of South Main Street.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.swamprabbits.com\/a-new-era-greenville-swamp-rabbits\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Swamp Rabbits press release<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/swamp_rabbits_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Name and Logos for Greenville Swamp Rabbits by Brandiose\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/swamp_rabbits_logo_alternate.png\" alt=\"New Name and Logos for Greenville Swamp Rabbits by Brandiose\" \/>\n<figcaption>Alternate logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>For a minor minor league team, the old logo was remarkably decent (not that &#8220;S&#8221; in Warriors, though, that&#8217;s unacceptable) and the mad viking-like Genghis Khan individual was menacing but also endearing &mdash; like, you would want to take him home, shave him, and feed him some soup. But it could have been for any team in any sport anywhere in the U.S.. Finding a local highlight has always been Brandiose&#8217;s specialty and here they&#8217;ve turned the name of a railroad into an awesome hockey logo of a beefed up rabbit holding a bandaged, carrot hockey stick. It&#8217;s too much fun. I don&#8217;t know if it was a color production issue but I would have liked the carrot leaves to be green as opposed to gray so that it didn&#8217;t look like a visualized fart. (Hey, I&#8217;m also allowed to have juvenile opinions, now and then!). The typography is really good too, avoiding the spikes yet still within that visual domain.<\/p>\n<p>There is an alternate logo of the rabbit showing a full body and it&#8217;s just as fun. There is an alternate-alternate logo of a couple of swampy paws (shown below in the jersey and poorly photographed puck) that add to the good-natured vibes of the logos.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/swamp_rabbits_cap.jpg\" alt=\"New Name and Logos for Greenville Swamp Rabbits by Brandiose\" \/>\n<figcaption>Cap.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/swamp_rabbits_tshirt.jpg\" alt=\"New Name and Logos for Greenville Swamp Rabbits by Brandiose\" \/>\n<figcaption>T-shirt.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/swamp_rabbits_puck.jpg\" alt=\"New Name and Logos for Greenville Swamp Rabbits by Brandiose\" \/>\n<figcaption>Puck with alternate paw logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/swamp_rabbits_jersey.jpg\" alt=\"New Name and Logos for Greenville Swamp Rabbits by Brandiose\" \/>\n<figcaption>Jersey.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/swamp_rabbits_cup.jpg\" alt=\"New Name and Logos for Greenville Swamp Rabbits by Brandiose\" \/>\n<figcaption>Cup, showing 1-color version.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">In application, no surprises here, just the logo placed on merch, nice and big, to sell. The images above also show how the logo works quite well in a single color. Overall, starting with the name change, this team now sounds and looks like something that you would pay attention to, more than the generic Road Warriors incarnation.
