Designed by Portland, OR-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.madebyband.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Band<\/a> the deadpan king pig is both sad and tasty-looking, specially with the blunt and irregular sans serif around it. Even the tracked out serif looks kinda cool. Obviously, the ambiance of the place (a bierhall) adds to the rustic charm but the irreverence starts with the pig all the way through the trough-like bags of french fries. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.madebyband.com\/portfolio\/lowbrau-beirhalle-2\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Hotel Koster by Bedow<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_hotelkoster.jpg\" alt=\"Hotel Koster by Bedow\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">With 78 guest rooms, <a href=\"http:\/\/hotelkoster.se\/en\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hotel Koster<\/a> is a charming and cozy resort and conference center located in the Kosten Islands off the west coast of Sweden. What better way to convey said charmingness than with a simple line-art logo and supporting graphics by Stockholm-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bedow.se\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bedow<\/a>? Despite being a rhetoric question, I do guess there are better ways, but this way is quite good for me. It&#8217;s almost like what an upscale summer camp run by Wes Anderson would look like. There isn&#8217;t much in the way of applications but the photos of the island on Bedow&#8217;s site will make you get in the mood for the simple line drawing of Hotel Koster. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bedow.se\/work\/identity-hotel-koster\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Micha Pelz by boymeetsgirl<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_michapelz.jpg\" alt=\"Micha Pelz by boymeetsgirl\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">Based around an abstract heart, Berlin-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/boymeetsgirl-design\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">boymeetsgirl<\/a> gave local hairdresser <a href=\"http:\/\/michapelz.de\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Micha Pelz<\/a> a flexible identity that represents the uniqueness of each of his clients. Designed around a stunning color palette of copper, muted mint, and black, the identity is very nicely crafted in print materials, signage, and even the interior wall painting of the studio. The heart icon works equally well on its own as it does in a pattern with dozens of the possible 6,000-plus configurations. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/20213879\/True-Beauty-Identity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project here<\/strong><\/a><\/strong>.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Today we cover swine, an island resort, and a hairdresser with a heart, with work from Portland, Stockholm, and Berlin&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[367,633,564],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3522"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3522"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3522\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3522"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3522"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3522"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
