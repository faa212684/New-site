It searches for the best fruit and vegetables around the world and brings them back to their farms where they are locally farmed and then sold to supermarkets, independent retailers, food service, restaurants, and export markets. Employing more than 500 people, Production Fresh has operated as a business-to-business brand but is now providing its berries, mangoes, broccoli and cabbages, capsicums and cucumbers, lettuce and herbs, mushrooms, and tomatoes as their own business-to-consumer brand and has introduced a new identity designed by the Sydney, Australia, office of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.interbrand.com\/au\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Interbrand<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/perfection_fresh_logo_a.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Perfection Fresh by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The old logo has probably been like that since 1978 and unlike some bad logos that age ironically well this one just aged. The new logo is a lovely seal that works great as a seal but is somewhat confusing as a logo, especially since it drops &#8220;Fresh&#8221; from the company name. &#8220;Perfection&#8221; isn&#8217;t a business name and it seems odd that they would enter the consumer market with a truncated name that most consumers will not bother to try to link back to the company Perfection Fresh. But perhaps there is some other strategery at play that makes this make sense. Having said that, as a piece of design, this is quite nice; the script, dare I say it, is perfection. It&#8217;s very well done and I like how the &#8220;f&#8221; shoots out on the top and bottom and the &#8220;n&#8221; is pretty too. The rest of the typography inside is cool too but nothing out of the ordinary.<\/p>\n<blockquote>The new identity invites Australians to &#8216;explore the world of taste&#8217;. Reminiscent of the post cards travellers write home, it&#8217;s a simple system that seamlessly blends practical nutritional and provenance information with emotional language and imagery.<br \/><br \/>Every piece and punnet tells its story. Beautiful illustrations display the lush and varied landscapes from which the produce was sourced and grown, while evocative tasting notes highlight unique flavours in a way not unlike a wine connoisseur would. And by approaching things in such a romantic and, dare we say, fresh way, we can encourage Australians to reconsider just how exciting, exotic and down-right delicious fruit and veg can really be.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.interbrand.com\/au\/work\/explore-world-taste\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Interbrand project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/perfection_fresh_ingredients.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Perfection Fresh by Interbrand\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/perfection_fresh_ingredients_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Perfection Fresh by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Identity elements.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/perfection_fresh_illustrations_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Perfection Fresh by Interbrand\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/perfection_fresh_illustrations_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Perfection Fresh by Interbrand\" \/>\n<figcaption>Illustration details.

The produce illustration is rich and saturated, the faux stamp motif is endearing, and the illustrations are great.

I would totally pick any of these up at a grocery store before any of the others. They have a premium yet accessible look that&#8217;s hard to find in the produce section.

Other than the lack of the full name in the logo, this is a great update.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1978, Perfection Fresh is a family-owned produce farmer, grower, and distributor in Australia.
