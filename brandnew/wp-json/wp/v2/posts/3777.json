Set against muted pink backgrounds the menus, coasters, and most adorable matchboxes ever, use a bold condensed sans serif paired with a rugged typewriter font. The contrast is really tasty and the red on pink color palette is one of my favorites.

(I know, shady, but let&#8217;s roll with it). So as local firm, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.anothercollective.pt\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Another Collective<\/a>, explains it they instead created an identity that relies on construction-related textures and backgrounds, which show up in the materials and website in a light gray, but the cool aspect of this identity is the custom, very slab-ey wordmark. At first I was kind of repelled by it but there more I looked at it the more I liked it and its exaggerated corners and it looks great in deep blue against the textures and the spare monospace typography. As a bonus, the website is rocking it with Typotheque&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.myfonts.com\/fonts\/typotheque\/fedra-mono\/?refby=ucllc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fedra Mono<\/a>. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.anothercollective.pt\/EN\/projects\/silarba-2015\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project here<\/strong><\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Beijing Opera by Daniel Ting Chong<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_beijingopera.jpg\" alt=\"Beijing Opera by Daniel Ting Chong\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">The next project is neither in Beijing nor is it about opera. <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/thebeijingopera\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Beijing Opera<\/a> is a dim sum restaurant in Cape Town, South Africa, but that didn&#8217;t stop local designer <a href=\"http:\/\/www.danieltingchong.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Daniel Ting Chong<\/a> from taking some Chinese visual cues, mainly the red color as a foundation. The logo shows a &#8220;B&#8221;, the opera singer in this metaphor, on a stage with drapes made out of noodles. It&#8217;s odd but it&#8217;s fun. The icon is accompanied by a wordmark set on a slight curve and while it could have been executed a little better &mdash; biggest issue is the opening and closing letters should have been tweaked to be lighter &mdash; it&#8217;s a catchy bit of typography that looks surprisingly fantastic small on pencils. This is one instance where gold foil doesn&#8217;t work as well on the logo but the emboss (shown in the header image) is beautiful and the more straightforward applications like the cap and apron are spot on. The fat dim sum eater has sung! <a href=\"http:\/\/www.danieltingchong.com\/1936\/5539091\/projects\/beijing-opera\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"A lot of white space, monospace fonts, and spare color palettes this week with work from New York, Matosinhos, and Cape Town&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[880,756,564],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3777"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3777"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3777\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3777"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3777"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3777"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
