I explain how I ended up with the &#8220;After&#8221; image in the comments. Even though I could change the whole post so that future visitors would not see the mistake, I would rather embrace the actual events and leave as is. The correct logo is in the comments as well. Apologies to our beloved readers for the oversight.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_hor_single.gif\" alt=\"---\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Web 1.0, if you will, left an indelible mark in the field of identity design: Google, eBay, Yahoo, and, of course PayPal. Logos that are more used, seen and interacted with than Nike, Apple and Starbucks&#8217;. A world (wide web) without any of these in their current design state would likely cause an implosion of confusion. Yes, I am afraid these logos will <em>never<\/em> change. PayPal, however has recently tiptoed into a new identity. Not that anyone would notice. According to this <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thepaypalblog.com\/weblog\/2007\/08\/paypals-new-log.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">&#8220;behind the scenes&#8221;<\/a> blog entry, hundreds of designs were reviewed, but ultimately, and after testing with customers, the internal brand team decided to stick with something painfully close to home. And now, with a new logo in place, the hard part begins, as &#8220;there are millions of logos that need to be updated&#8221;. So as a service to the millions of users out there that have a PayPal logo on their web site, I have put together a handy guide for how to make a smooth transition into the new logo. Experience with horizontal and vertical scaling of type is necessary; please do not attempt if you have never fidgeted with the proportions of a carefully designed typeface.<\/p><!--more--><p><strong>STEP 1.<\/strong>\nPlace old and new logos side to side.
