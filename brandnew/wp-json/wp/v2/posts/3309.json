Art-directed by Berlin-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hort.org.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">HORT<\/a>, their identity for the publication makes its own creative use of space by having a literally flexible logo that can make the best use of a canvas by extending any of its letters. The squared off wordmark is as simple as it gets but the unapologetically big use in the letterhead and business cards against the small, minimal typography makes for a unique, very noticeable look. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hort.org.uk\/414\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">The Palomar by Here<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_palomar.jpg\" alt=\"The Palomar by Here\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">Just like <a href=\"http:\/\/thepalomar.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Palomar<\/a> in London brings together a mix of flavors from various spots in the world, the identity by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.heredesign.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Here<\/a> brings together a number of eclectic visuals. Case in point: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.myfonts.com\/fonts\/linotype\/eurostile\/?refby=ucllc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Eurostile<\/a>! Which works remarkably well in the bold weight (not at all in the light weight) as a complement to the quirky script wordmark. Used full-bleed in some cases, the wordmark divides the area where it sits into two colors &mdash; a move that usually renders amateurish results but here it&#8217;s oddly convincing. Then there is some funky, wavy patterns that make good use of the lovely color palette of baby and dark blue, salmon, tan, and gold. Again, kind of weird, but it works so well in the overall package. Plus, gold foil is having a moment these days. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.heredesign.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project here<\/strong><\/a><\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">TextielMuseum and Lab by Raw Color<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_textile_museum.jpg\" alt=\"TextielMuseum and Lab by Raw Color\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">Located in Tilburg, The Netherlands, the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.textielmuseum.nl\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TextielMuseum<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.textiellab.nl\/en\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TextielLab<\/a>, as their name imply, are devoted to textiles.

It also lends itself to a variety of stunning patterns that have been produced by the Lab, including these lovely <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rawcolor.nl\/project\/?id=420&#038;type=assignment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">dish towels<\/a> that look more like they should be hung from a wall in display instead of hanging over the kitchen sink. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rawcolor.nl\/project\/?id=400&#038;type=assignment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"From simple and spare to complex and patterned, we have a healthy range of projects with work from Berlin, London, and Eindhoven&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[196,327,564],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3309"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3309"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3309\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3309"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3309"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3309"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
