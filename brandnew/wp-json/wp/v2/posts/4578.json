The organization&#8217;s agencies and partners have\nalready integrated the new brand identity assets to court designs, advertising,\nevent signage and decor, tickets, websites, programs and apparel for all\nchampionship sports.<br \/><br \/>The NCAA championships logo system features a\nconsistent logo architecture anchored by the iconic championship trophy; new\nathlete iconography for each of the 24 sports; and a distinctive typeface that\nreflects the speed, strength, and skills of each sport. <\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/2016-ncaa-final-four-championship-logos-feature-new-design-300237908.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Joe Bosack &amp; Co. press release<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ncaa_championships_intro_icons.png\"\nalt=\"New Logos for NCAA Championships by Joe Bosack &amp; Co\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ncaa_championships_intro_banner_direction.png\"\nalt=\"New Logos for NCAA Championships by Joe Bosack &amp; Co\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icon structure for all NCAA sports.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ncaa_championships_intro_icons_all.png\"\nalt=\"New Logos for NCAA Championships by Joe Bosack &amp; Co\" \/>\n<figcaption>All icons.

It&#8217;s not quite the Olympics but it&#8217;s still a\nhandful of a challenge and the two-tone figures rise to it. In some cases the\ndetached head feels a little weird but it&#8217;s a visual element that helps tie all\nof them together in an unexpected way. Placing the icons inside the banner\nshape gives the icons some tension to work with &#8212; the gymnastics one is\nparticularly good &#8212; and I like how sometimes the icons are larger and cropped\ninside the banner. The idea to rotate the banners from regular season to\nchampionships is thoughtful but I doubt anyone will ever notice.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ncaa_championships_intro_font.png\"\nalt=\"New Logos for NCAA Championships by Joe Bosack &amp; Co\" \/>\n<figcaption>Custom font.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Another element is a custom font that is pretty much what you would expect\nbut, thankfully, it has no slabs, no spikes, no notches&#8230; it&#8217;s just a strong,\nitalic, condensed sans serif with some angular sculpting.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ncaa_championships_intro_logo_types.png\"\nalt=\"New Logos for NCAA Championships by Joe Bosack &amp; Co\" \/>\n<figcaption>Different levels of logos.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>From the icons and the font, the logo system starts to take shape. Starting\neasy with an icon, font, and NCAA logo lock-up that is simple and effective and\nwhere the angles of the banner and font work nicely together. The top-level\nchampionship logo gets a little more elaborate with multiple levels of typography\nbut still works well. It all culminates in the flashier signature championships\nlogos for the most popular sports, including the insanely huge basketball\ntournament, aka March Madness.<\/p>\n<blockquote>More than 20,000 online surveys were distributed to fans, student\nathletes, corporate partners, licensees, school administrators and equipment\nsuppliers, asking them to judge old and new logos. Another 1,000 in-depth\ninterviews were conducted, including 400 with student athletes from all three\ndivisions.<br \/><br \/>Upon completion of the project, [Mark Lewis, the NCAA&#8217;s\nexecutive vice president for championships and partnerships] said he was proud\nthat 72 percent of the thousands polled thought the new logos provided a better\nimage of the championships. Within that group, 62 percent of student athletes\nand school administrators thought the new championship logos were more\ncelebratory.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.sportsbusinessdaily.com\/Journal\/Issues\/2015\/02\/02\/Colleges\/NCAA-logos.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sports Business Daily story<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ncaa_championships_final_four_before_after.png\"\nalt=\"New Logos for NCAA Championships by Joe Bosack &amp; Co\" \/>\n<figcaption>2014 and 2015 Final Four logos compared to the new system for the\n2016, 2017, and beyond Final Four logo system.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>Final Four logos are built with flexibility in mind.

Location! &#8212; and representing them in an elegant, dynamic, and\nperfectly executed way. There is no unnecessary shading, no gratuitous notches\nand spikes, no endless layering of strokes. My favorite element is the shading\neffect inside the &#8220;FINAL FOUR&#8221; type; for some reason, that just looks lovely.\nThe Final Four logos and all other championship logos now include a\nrepresentation of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=ncaa+trophy&#038;source=lnms&#038;tbm=isch&#038;sa=X&#038;ved=0ahUKEwix29zt09bLAhXIKCYKHTzEDzMQ_AUIBygB&#038;biw=1621&#038;bih=866\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">physical NCAA trophy<\/a> which is a very clever way of\nincluding the obligatory NCAA logo in the logos, now done in a meaningful\nway.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ncaa_championships_final_four_ball.jpg\"\nalt=\"New Logos for NCAA Championships by Joe Bosack &amp; Co\" \/>\n<figcaption>Final Four ball.

There\nis a clear and obvious visual system to them but they each feel special. The\ncolor palettes built around the difficult blue and tan key colors of the trophy\nare surprisingly good-looking. It&#8217;s hard to imagine this system holding on for\nmore than three or five years before it devolves into the tackier aesthetics of\nsports identity and that&#8217;s not the fault of the designers but the nature of\ndesign and deprecation of minimal aesthetics. It&#8217;s the equivalent of soda\npackaging gone minimal that suddenly starts sprouting bubbles in the background\nthen increases to giant swooshes and other inane graphics. But I digress. This\nis a fantastic system from the icons to the highly televised championship\nlogos, giving us non-March-Madness-non-fans something to cheer for this college\nchampionship season.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1906, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) is a member-led, nonprofit organization &quot;dedicated to the well-being and lifelong success of college athletes&quot;.
