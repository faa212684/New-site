I have a mower, but I have no idea what brand it is, some kind of Earthsomething or other. For a Texan, I really disappoint when it comes to my fuel-powered equipment. Clearly, I&#8217;m in the minority when it comes to outdoor power equipment appreciation as it is a $8.5 billion market with $6.5 being consumed by lawn mowing equipment, according to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.americasgreatestbrands.com\/volume5\/pdf\/snapper.pdf\">this handy brand case study [PDF]<\/a> that places <a href=\"http:\/\/www.snapper.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Snapper<\/a> as one of the top brands in said industry with more than one hundred years of experience. Recently, Snapper introduced <a href=\"http:\/\/www.snappernxt.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Snapper NXT<\/a>, a new line of products designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.designworksusa.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BMW Group DesignWorks USA<\/a> and along with them came a revised identity by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cbx.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CBX<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/snapper_sam.gif\" alt=\"Snapper\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Sam the Turtle, over the years.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/snapper_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"Snapper\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The biggest change is to Sam the Turtle, who has been seeing less action over the years as Snapper&#8217;s other <strike>mascot<\/strike> spokesperson, Brett Favre, has become the focus. Sam has been transformed from a cartoon to a more auto-like badge and represents the next generation of Snapper products. Based on the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Alligator_Snapping_Turtle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">alligator snapping turtle<\/a>, that sports ridges on its shell and a pointy beak, the new icon definitely feels more &#8220;branded&#8221; and like something that belongs on a motorized machine that lives in a garage alongside the family&#8217;s car. Reducing any animal to an icon is hard, and turtles are no exception as this icon proves. The shell and face of the turtle look cool and menacing, but the the front legs feel a little dead and awkward. The subtle gradations work well in defining the shapes, but it&#8217;s not something that gets me clamoring for more.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/snapper_photo.jpg\" alt=\"Snapper\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/snapper_typography.gif\" alt=\"Snapper\" \/><\/p>\n<p>For the Snapper NXT identity, CBX did a less dramatic change and went with an evolution of the old typography, and it&#8217;s a definite improvement. But the same can&#8217;t be said for the &#8220;NXT&#8221; part as it looks exactly like what you would imagine anything called &#8220;NXT&#8221; would look like: it&#8217;s pointy, it&#8217;s trendy, it looks like it could be on any kind of next-generation product. And the gradients don&#8217;t help any more than they do the new turtle.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/snapper_nxt_logo.gif\" alt=\"Snapper\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/snapper_nxt_photo.jpg\" alt=\"Snapper\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Overall, the change takes Snapper from a &#8220;cute&#8221; brand to a technology-driven product. A strong move but not as snappy as it could be.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_100329_config_01a.xml&#038;xyz=poll_100329_votes_01a.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_100329_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_100329_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_100329_config_03.xml&#038;xyz=poll_100329_votes_03.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv3\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv3\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,51,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1062"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1062"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1062\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1062"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1062"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1062"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
