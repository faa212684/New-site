Rich in history, landmarks, and attractions, Baltimore is probably best known for being the backdrop to <em>The Wire<\/em>, the HBO show that reflected its darker side. But it&#8217;s not all Stringer Bells and boarded up rowhouses in Baltimore and the new identity and campaign by local agency <a href=\"http:\/\/tbc.us\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TBC<\/a> aims to demonstrate that.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>To highlight to visitors that Baltimore is a dynamic, engaging city, we invited some of Baltimore&#8217;s biggest fans and most famous faces to share what they love about this phenomenal town. Print, radio, online video spots and page takeovers in major markets and national publications gave our celebrity spokespeople a chance to share the things they love and the neighborhoods that keep them coming back year after year. We also turned the abbreviation &#8220;Bmore&#8221; into a rallying cry&#8211;&#8220;Be more&#8221;&#8211;and anchored the campaign with a mark and related designs that can change with the calendar to highlight all there is to do in our home city.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/tbc.us\/visit-baltimore-branding.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TBC project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/visit_baltimore_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Visit Baltimore by TBC\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/visit_baltimore_logo_alternates.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Visit Baltimore by TBC\" \/>\n<figcaption>Alternate logos.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/visit_baltimore_logo_animated.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Visit Baltimore by TBC\" \/>\n<figcaption>&#8220;Be more&#8221; version with other language.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The previous identity was designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/landor.com\/pdfs\/cases\/Case5600-A4.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Landor in 2005 (PDF)<\/a> and it was a decent logo with a more-is-more approach of trying to put in one of everything that Baltimore has. Perhaps it was a tad too kid-friendly serving as a starting point for the new logo to react to. The new logo is not the most pleasant to look at. The giant &#8220;B&#8221; with its single slab serif on the top is very odd and the way it frames &#8220;more&#8221; is very uncomfortable, deleting the stem of the &#8220;m&#8221; and making the &#8220;e&#8221; look very narrow. As a lock-up it&#8217;s redundant, reading as &#8220;Balti-B-More&#8221;.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/visit_baltimore_logo_with_stuff_single.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Visit Baltimore by TBC\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/visit_baltimore_logo_with_stuff_more.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Visit Baltimore by TBC\" \/>\n<figcaption>&#8220;Be more&#8221; version with stuff.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Without the &#8220;Balti&#8221; part, the logo is a little more successful. Having been to Baltimore only once in my life and not knowing many people from there, I questioned whether calling Baltimore &#8220;Bmore&#8221; was a thing or not, but since it&#8217;s listed on one of the most trusted online sources, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.urbandictionary.com\/define.php?term=b-more\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the Urban Dictionary<\/a>, then my doubts were assuaged. The &#8220;Be more&#8221; version of the logo, rendered in 3D is forced to resolve the &#8220;more&#8221; typography by doing a color-on-color approach which, surprisingly, is not bad. Even the logo-as-window treatment comes across better than usual. I&#8217;m not a fan, to be clear, but once the logo has been &#8220;activated&#8221; it&#8217;s kind of convincing.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/visit_baltimore_ads_celebrities_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Visit Baltimore by TBC\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/visit_baltimore_ads_celebrities_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Visit Baltimore by TBC\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/visit_baltimore_ads_celebrities_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Visit Baltimore by TBC\" \/>\n<figcaption>Some famous people born in or fans of Baltimore.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/123951092?color=ffffff&#038;title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Live spot.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The celebrity spots and print ads are colorful and friendly and even the choices make for compelling spokespeople. Who doesn&#8217;t love Mike Rowe? Or Common? Or Will Gardner? The ads aren&#8217;t my cup of tea and they wouldn&#8217;t make me visit Baltimore any more than <em>The Wire<\/em> would but they are effective and, again, done with enough conviction and consistency to become appealing.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/visit_baltimore_stuff.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Visit Baltimore by TBC\" \/>\n<figcaption>A few promo materials.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/visit_baltimore_tshirt.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Visit Baltimore by TBC\" \/>\n<figcaption>T-shirts.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/visit_baltimore_bag.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Visit Baltimore by TBC\" \/>\n<figcaption>Bag and mug.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/visit_baltimore_brochure.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Visit Baltimore by TBC\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brochure.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">In application, things go a little haywire with far too many different ideas at play, with the logo being filled with other illustrations or the introduction of a new pattern (as seen in the shopping bag or brochure) but for most of them being prototypes I guess it&#8217;s a matter of establishing a direction and showing the potential. Overall, this feels like a case of the tail wagging the dog with the ad campaign and graphics defining the identity, which is not necessarily a bad thing but it shows in the weaker logo against the more robust campaign.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1980 as the Baltimore Area Convention &amp; Visitors Association, Visit Baltimore is the organization responsible and devoted for attracting business and leisure visitors to the city.
