Designed by Munich-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kms-team.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">KMS Team<\/a>, the logo is set in the endangered species of reverse italics. Not only is it a reverse italic, it&#8217;s an <em>extreme<\/em> reverse italic with a boundary-pushing slant. It&#8217;s also condensed and cropped. It&#8217;s a miracle it&#8217;s readable. And it looks fantastic by itself and in application, especially on the bike frames. (There are multiple project pages at the bottom of the link, so make sure you check those out). <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kms-team.com\/en\/referenzen\/canyon-bicycles\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project here<\/strong><\/a><\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">The Woods Coffee by Man Man Van<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_woodscoffee.jpg\" alt=\"The Woods Coffee by Man Man Van\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.thewoodscoffee.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Woods Coffee<\/a> is a chain of 14 coffee shops in Lynden, WA, with their own coffee product line. While their website still rocks a Papyrus-y logo, the packaging is brewing a woodsy, rugged, hipster-y look designed by Salt Lake City, UT-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.manmanvan.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Man Man Van<\/a>. Even though Emigre&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.emigre.com\/EF.php?fid=83\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brothers<\/a> has been played to death in small, craft beverage designs, it still looks pretty good in this understated use along with the generous white space and tree-lined roof silhouette. The fields of black on the side of the bags give a great contrast to the fronts and as the painted rim on the metal cup it&#8217;s pitch-perfect for Pinteresting the hell out of it. The Cold Brew bottles are pretty sweet too although I would have liked to see a true inverse version of the roof-and-tree logo with the trees being the color of the bottle and the roof in white ink. Still, good stuff. <strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.manmanvan.com\/projects\/#\/woods-coffee\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Nativetech by Anagrama<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_nativetech.jpg\" alt=\"Nativetech by Anagrama\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">Produced by Siemalabs in San Nicol&aacute;s de los Garza, Nuevo Le&oacute;n (near Monterrey), Nativetech is a new line of sports nutrition supplements with an identity and packaging designed by &mdash; who else? &mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.anagrama.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Anagrama<\/a>. The packaging has a great <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=geigy+pharmaceuticals+packaging&#038;es_sm=91&#038;source=lnms&#038;tbm=isch&#038;sa=X&#038;ei=FCE6VcGvEcm_sAW9goHYBg&#038;ved=0CAcQ_AUoAQ&#038;biw=1317&#038;bih=793\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Geigy Pharmaceutical<\/a> vibe with its large Helvetica numbers and fields of color. What makes it stand out though is the great color palette; it&#8217;s unexpected and highly energetic, looking almost electric in these sexy photos. The white field with info and type that runs across the boxes is signature Anagrama and, obvs., looks great. Lo and behold, though, the &#8220;nt&#8221; monogram (not shown in the pictures above but you can see it at the link), is awkward and gangly in contrast to the rest of the elements.
