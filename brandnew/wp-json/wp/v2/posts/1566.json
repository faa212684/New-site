Much like MTV, MuchMusic has also transitioned into less music and more reality TV, scripted programming, and movies. Coinciding with the acquisition by Bell of CTV, MuchMusic parent&#8217;s company, the channel introduced a new identity that did away with its 15-year-old logo that had gained significant recognition.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/muchmusic_logo_detail.gif\" alt=\"MuchMusic\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/muchmusic_one-color.gif\" alt=\"MuchMusic\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The old logo felt like a sticker you would find in the restroom of your favorite club and, if drunk enough, you would scribble &#8220;Fuck Yeah!&#8221; on top of it with a black marker. The new logo&hellip; is like a business card you would find in Martha Stewart&#8217;s bathroom. And it would be scented. The contrast in old and new is so jarring that it&#8217;s clear that someone didn&#8217;t want to have anything to do with the channel&#8217;s past. The new logo is not only boring, it&#8217;s awkward and places emphasis on the wrong things: I mostly see &#8220;UC&#8221;. There is also one-color applications that then have an additional background that, although not any more pleasing, at least resolves the &#8220;M&#8221; a little better. For a music channel for a young generation of viewers this logo is very subdued.<\/p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/16001166?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=808080\" width=\"574\" height=\"323\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><a href=\"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/16001166\">MuchMusic &#8211; Rebrand 2011<\/a> from <a href=\"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/ngirard\">Nicolas Girard<\/a> on <a href=\"http:\/\/vimeo.com\">Vimeo<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/17663706?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=808080\" width=\"574\" height=\"323\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><a href=\"\/17663706\">MUCH Bumpers<\/a> from <a href=\"\/ngirard\">Nicolas Girard<\/a> on <a href=\"\/\">Vimeo<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>In animation &mdash; and I hope I have this right since I can&#8217;t just turn on the telly at 5:30 am and check that this is the actual on-air look of a Canadian channel &mdash; the logo looks great because it&#8217;s almost not there and the subtle color palette and minimalist graphic look is very nicely brought to life by motion designer Nicolas Girard.
