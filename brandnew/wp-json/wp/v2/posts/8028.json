A product of the 1960&#8217;s natural food movement, Dave learned early that quality ingredients matter. He developed his personal philosophy on life, which is what drives Nature&#8217;s Bakery: keep things simple, have fun, and achieve balance in life through nature, activity, nutrition and community. After spending decades as a baker, Dave teamed up with his son, Sam. Their endeavor grew to become the Nature&#8217;s Bakery of today, fulfilling their mission to create delicious, nutritious and accessible snacks to nourish families everywhere. Today, Nature&#8217;s Bakery is still family-owned and one of the fastest growing snack brands in the category with over $100M in sales. Nature&#8217;s Bakery products include Whole Wheat Fig Bars, Gluten Free Fig Bars, Double Brownie Bars and Organic Honey and Oat Bars.&#8221;<\/p><!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/natures_bakery_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Nature&amp;apos;s Bakery by Hatch Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/natures_bakery_previous_packaging.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Nature&amp;apos;s Bakery by Hatch Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Samples of previous packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/natures_bakery_new_01_box_before_after.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Nature&amp;apos;s Bakery by Hatch Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Box, before and after.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/natures_bakery_new_02_single_pack_before_after.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Nature&amp;apos;s Bakery by Hatch Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Single pack, before and after.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/natures_bakery_new_03_single_pack.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Nature&amp;apos;s Bakery by Hatch Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Single pack.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Natures-bakery_new-04_hatch-BN_6ct_box_FlavorExtensions.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Nature&amp;apos;s Bakery by Hatch Design\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Natures-bakery_new-05_hatch-BN_6ct_box_FlavorExtensions.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Nature&amp;apos;s Bakery by Hatch Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Boxes.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Natures-bakery_new-06_hatch-BN_bar_detail_brand_language.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Nature&amp;apos;s Bakery by Hatch Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Brand language.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Natures-bakery_new-07_hatch-BN_bars.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Nature&amp;apos;s Bakery by Hatch Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Bars.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Natures-bakery_new-08_hatch-BN_photographyDetail.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Nature&amp;apos;s Bakery by Hatch Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Photography detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Natures-bakery_new-09_hatch-BN_line_extensions.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Nature&amp;apos;s Bakery by Hatch Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Line extensions.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Natures-bakery_new-10_hatch-BN_out_of_home.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Nature&amp;apos;s Bakery by Hatch Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Out of home advertising.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Natures-bakery_new-11_hatch-BN_smiley-animated.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Nature&amp;apos;s Bakery by Hatch Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Smiley face, animated.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/natures_bakery_various_IRL.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Nature&amp;apos;s Bakery by Hatch Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Lots of action photos.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"(Est. 2010) &quot;Nature&apos;s Bakery was founded in 2010 by Dave and Sam Marson, father and son bakers from Reno, Nevada.
