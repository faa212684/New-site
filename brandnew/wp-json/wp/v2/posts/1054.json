(I know there is more, I&#8217;m being sarcastic). A new campaign for the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.egypt.travel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Egyptian Tourist Authority<\/a> developed by the Cairo office of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jwt.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">JWT<\/a> aims to establish Egypt as a place where there is more than really big tombs. And accompanying this campaign is a new logo.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/egypt_print_ads.jpg\" alt=\"Egypt\" \/><\/p>\n<object width=\"480\" height=\"385\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/psJ9G7f9Yn0&#038;hl=en_US&#038;fs=1&#038;\"><\/param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"><\/param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"><\/param><embed src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/psJ9G7f9Yn0&#038;hl=en_US&#038;fs=1&#038;\" type=\"application\/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"480\" height=\"385\"><\/embed><\/object>\n<p>The print and TV campaign perhaps does too good a job in touting other things to think about when we consider Egypt, and it starts to look more like a Caribbean island combined with a non-stop party place where you can golf and, by the way, you can catch some pyramids in between all of that. But maybe after all that, Egypt just starts to feel like a generic destination.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/egypt_logo_detail.jpg\" alt=\"Egypt\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Regarding the logo, the biggest shame is that it is used so small in the web site, where the detail of the texture gets completely lost and reduces to what looks like a cheap watercolor painting. Seen at a large size the logo is quite elegant and energetic and it&#8217;s always nice to see someone actually pick up a writing instrument to craft something. Aside from the texture, the lettering is well done, although I feel the &#8220;e&#8221; is a tad light and small in contrast to the rest of the letters. I&#8217;m torn in whether the &#8220;t&#8221; being represented by the well-known <a href=\"http:\/\/www.touregypt.net\/featurestories\/ankh.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ankh symbol<\/a> is a clich&eacute; or not but it works in triggering associations to Egyptian hieroglyphics &mdash; it&#8217;s also a little big and stands out too much from the rest of the letters. I also really like the shift in colors from something less sand-ey to something more fluid.<\/p>\n<p>Where things start to fall apart, almost literally, with a splat of the watercolor dotting the &#8220;i,&#8221; is in the tag line with the jarring use of <a href=\"http:\/\/new.myfonts.com\/fonts\/apple\/skia\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Skia<\/a>, a Matthew Carter typeface that functions for all things Greek, Roman, and, now, Egyptian. Compared to the old logo, despite it warning us that &#8220;Nothing Compares!&#8221; this is a great redesign with far more character than the previous.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.printhouse.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Aleksander Lenart<\/a> for the tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_100317_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_100317_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_100317_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_100317_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_100317_config_03.xml&#038;xyz=poll_100317_votes_03.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"184\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv3\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv3\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,64,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1054"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1054"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1054\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1054"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1054"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1054"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
