Non-governmental, non-religious, non-political and non-profit making, it works alongside people with disabilities, whatever the context, offering them assistance and supporting them in their efforts to become self-reliant. Since its creation, the organisation has set up programmes in approximately 60 countries and intervened in many emergency situations. It has a network of eight national associations (Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Switzerland, United Kingdom, USA) which provide human and financial resources, manage projects and raise awareness of Handicap International&#8217;s actions and campaigns. Handicap International is best known for its fight against antipersonnel mines, cluster munitions and assistance to those who are victims of these weapons.&#8221;<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/handicap_international_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Handicap International by Cossette\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/handicap_international_summary.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Handicap International by Cossette\" \/>\n<figcaption>Identity summary.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/handicap_international_use_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Handicap International by Cossette\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/handicap_international_use_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Handicap International by Cossette\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/handicap_international_use_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Handicap International by Cossette\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/handicap_international_use_04.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Handicap International by Cossette\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/handicap_international_use_05.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Handicap International by Cossette\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/handicap_international_use_06.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Handicap International by Cossette\" \/>\n<figcaption>Field applications.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"(Est. 1982) &quot;Handicap International is an international organisation specialised in the field of disability.
