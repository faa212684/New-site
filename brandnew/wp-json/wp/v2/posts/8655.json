Available in three sizes &#8212; from the more typical 200mg bottle to a hulking (relatively speaking) 1000mg &#8212; Hanayu&#8217;s oil is balanced for &#8220;energy and focus for your day, inner peace and relaxation for the night&#8221; within the allotted  0.2% THC limit in Germany. Using a specially developed and patented low pressure process, their oils are made in Germany and Austria and, for now, sold only online. Hanayu&#8217;s identity and packaging have been designed by Hamburg, Germany-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.eiga.de\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">EIGA<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hanayu_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Hanayu by EIGA\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>While full-on, high-inducing cannabis products and retailers have been getting high-end design treatments, CBD oil has, for the most part, lived in a design purgatory where the various logos and packaging for the hundreds of brands out there try to portray the product as both cannabis-esque and pharma-esque, landing in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=cbd+oil&#038;tbm=isch&#038;ved=2ahUKEwi8mZGLnfnoAhWNf6wKHS5iAckQ2-cCegQIABAA&#038;oq=cbd+oil&#038;gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzIECCMQJzIECCMQJzIFCAAQgwEyBQgAEIMBMgQIABBDMgIIADIECAAQQzICCAAyAggAMgIIAFCEihRYhIoUYLqMFGgAcAB4AIABSogBSpIBATGYAQCgAQGqAQtnd3Mtd2l6LWltZw&#038;sclient=img&#038;ei=wL-eXry5E43_sQWuxIXIDA&#038;bih=898&#038;biw=1516&#038;safe=active\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a weird pastiche of marijuana visuals and apothecary vibes<\/a>. All that to say that Hanayu is more straightly positioned as a lifestyle, feel-good brand more in tune with the growing trend of finely-presented cannabis products with a logo that could easily be for a fashion brand. I take that back because most fashion brands now are bland sans serifs and this is a fairly exotic high-contrast sans with some exaggerated shapes and sharp edges that, well, give the brand an edge. I really like the wordmark but I wonder if, like in yesterday&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/new_logo_and_identity_for_ably_by_heydays.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ably post<\/a>, the &#8220;y&#8221; would have benefitted from being more like the &#8220;u&#8221; as the angled letterform creates the few odd moments in the wordmark, like how it touches the &#8220;u&#8221;. Still, it&#8217;s pretty nice and it has personality.<\/p>\n<blockquote>The hanayu brand design uses striking, abstract elements to present the brand messages consistently across all channels while ensuring a clear differentiation from other CBD brands. Conceptual visuals illustrate the topic of &#8220;finding focus&#8221; and offer the opportunity to create a strong series of key visuals for packaging and social media. The photographic style and choice of motifs create a concise visual identity and emphasize the concept of &#8220;serenity&#8221;.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.eiga.de\/en\/work\/7576-2\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">EIGA project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hanayu_illustrations.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Hanayu by EIGA\" \/>\n<figcaption>Illustrations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hanayu_packaging_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Hanayu by EIGA\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hanayu_packaging_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Hanayu by EIGA\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hanayu_packaging_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Hanayu by EIGA\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hanayu_packaging_04.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Hanayu by EIGA\" \/>\n<figcaption>Lots of packaging shots.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The packaging has zero marijuana leave visuals on it and it&#8217;s a CBD oil miracle. Instead, it features some abstract illustrations that are quite trippy and, if stared at too long on their own at large sizes, a little disturbing but the way they are used in the cylindrical boxes, taking up a very limited area and serving more as accents, they look beautiful and the structural thick black line that crops them feels very elegant, with the rest of the package in a minimalist approach. The tiny bottles inside could perhaps use a touch of something, like a spark of color somewhere as they feel a little too bare but, again, mostly I&#8217;m grateful there isn&#8217;t green foliage on it.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hanayu_packaging_05.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Hanayu by EIGA\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hanayu_packaging_06.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Hanayu by EIGA\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hanayu_packaging_07.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Hanayu by EIGA\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hanayu_packaging_08.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Hanayu by EIGA\" \/>\n<figcaption>Even more packaging shots.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/hanayu_packaging_leaking.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Hanayu by EIGA\" \/>\n<figcaption>CBD on the loose.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">Overall, this is definitely on the creative end of the spectrum and it can probably afford to be that way as it&#8217;s not meant to be a mass market CBD oil product which has to rely on those quick, easily-absorbable (pun!) marijuana references to sell more efficiently but it&#8217;s usually nich\u00e9 products like this that slowly seep (pun!) into the mainstream for better overall design options and that should provide some inner peace for us design snobs.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Launched this year, Hanayu is a brand of CBD oil in Germany started by three friends.
