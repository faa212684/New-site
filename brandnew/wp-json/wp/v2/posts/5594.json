BBQs, two Goode Co. Seafoods, one Goode Co. Taqueria, and The Armadillo Palace. The company also has a thriving catering business and a bounty of merchandise for sale, from sausages to pies to hats. Over the last and the next few months, Goode Co. has been introducing a master brand for the company and all its properties designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.designbyprinciple.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Principle<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/goode_co_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logos and Identity for Goode Co. by Principle\" \/>\n<figcaption>Main logo.

Cleaned up by <a href=\"http:\/\/jessicahische.is\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jessica Hische<\/a> the new logo is an extra lovely piece of script lettering and it&#8217;s the equivalent of finding a car in a junkyard and restoring it to shiny glory. All the swashes are in the right place and at the right length and all thick and thin variations are perfectly balanced. Taking away the angle it used to sit at makes the logo much more elegant as well.<\/p>\n<p>With the old individual logos for each restaurant you might argue that, in their kitschiness, they served their purpose well but even by Texan kitsch standards that Armadillo Palace logo was an onslaught of unappealing Texan-ness. The Seafood logo was far from imaginative or pleasant and the BBQ and Taqueria logos looked like the baseball team logos for the company to participate in corporate tournaments. The new logos are, yes, more corporate and take away some of the &#8220;flavor&#8221; away but, without a doubt, they are infinitely better and help establish the Goode Co. name as the connecting thread among all the properties.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/goode_co_sauces_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logos and Identity for Goode Co. by Principle\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/goode_co_sauces_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logos and Identity for Goode Co. by Principle\" \/>\n<figcaption>Packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/goode_co_beer_trays.jpg\" alt=\"New Logos and Identity for Goode Co. by Principle\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/goode_co_beer_trays_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logos and Identity for Goode Co. by Principle\" \/>\n<figcaption>Beer trays.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/goode_co_livery_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logos and Identity for Goode Co. by Principle\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/goode_co_livery_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logos and Identity for Goode Co. by Principle\" \/>\n<figcaption>Livery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The applications all make great use of the logo as the centerpiece and garnish it with a wide range of complementary fonts. In a way, none of it is surprising as it follows familiar restaurant and food tropes but everything is so well done and so good-looking that it&#8217;s not hard to go along for the ride.
