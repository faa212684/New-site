The identity, designed by local firm <a href=\"https:\/\/markacollective.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Marka Collective<\/a>, features a great icon that blends one of Katenitza&#8217;s recurring tile shapes with a hand, signifying their handmade approach but also making allusion to Hamsa, the palm-shaped sign that, when used as an amulet, brings its owner happiness, luck, health, and good fortune. It&#8217;s a great abstraction and it works so well in all the different applications in this identity, be it embossed, stamped, or straight-up printed. I&#8217;m not a huge fan of the wordmark but it pairs very well with the icon has a good exotic vibe that works <em>hand in hand<\/em> with the icon. The shapes of the tiles also inspire a range of patterns used in different postcards and a mystery tubular thing with die-cut tile shapes that looks all kinds of great. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/markacollective.com\/projects\/katenitza\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Ida Graves by Buddy-Buddy<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_idagraves.jpg\" alt=\"Ida Graves by Buddy-Buddy\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.idagraves.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ida Graves<\/a> is a certified organic distillery in Alexandria, MN, crafting a series of spirits that include vodka, gin, and aquavit.

The pastel color palette on the labels is soft and inviting and all the typography throughout is very finely tuned. I&#8217;m not sure about the significance of the bird but it makes for yet another lovely element to the identity. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/buddy-buddy.co\/Ida-Graves\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Some more ornate and elaborate identities this week, with work from Vancouver, Varna, and Minneapolis&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[69,11,85,26],"tags":[1706,564,1465,1097,570],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8124"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=8124"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8124\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=8124"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=8124"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=8124"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
