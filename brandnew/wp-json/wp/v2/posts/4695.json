I&#8217;ll grant that it&#8217;s readability is not ideal but once you know the name &#8212; and you&#8217;ll know the name because most likely you will see this logo when you are on http:\/\/onno.studio or instagram.com\/onno.studio and not when you are out on the street and see it on a billboard &#8212; the solution is a beautiful typographic treatment of &#8220;O&#8221;s and &#8220;N&#8221;s. Maybe there is a concept to it, maybe not, but, as a visual, I really dig it. The applications are a little too bare, even for a minimal logo but it all matches together&#8230; except for the serif. The serif I could either do without or with some other serif. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/33849926\/ONNO-Branding\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Feed by TBWA\\Istanbul<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_feed.jpg\" alt=\"Feed by TBWA\\Istanbul\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">Not much info about this one, other than a YouTube video (linked as the project link) and a wonky purchase page but it&#8217;s fairly simple: <a href=\"http:\/\/feedmag.net\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Feed<\/a> is a new food magazine, published by someone and available somewhere. (Logo Design Love <a href=\"http:\/\/www.logodesignlove.com\/feed-magazine\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">has some explanatory images<\/a> as well.) Designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tbwa.com.tr\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TBWA\\Istanbul<\/a>, the main idea for the flexible logo is that &#8220;Feed&#8221; can have as many &#8220;e&#8221;s as it wants, needs, or fits. Tilted one way in the basic logo, the &#8220;e&#8221;s can each rotate willy nilly when used exponentially. It&#8217;s almost a dumb system but it&#8217;s perfectly executed and creates some great visuals. I love how it can be done two ways: one, like in the cover where the &#8220;e&#8221;s are spread out like an alphabet soup; or two, like in the spine of the magazine (shown in the header image) where they go in a straight line and adapt to the length of whatever is holding it. Both are so goooooooooood. As a bonus, the diacritics, accents, and dots in the custom font are all &#8220;e&#8221;s because &#8220;e&#8221;.<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=8qpzOQklJDY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">The Playlist Co. by Blok Design<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_theplaylist.jpg\" alt=\"The Playlist Company by Blok Design\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.theplaylist.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Playlist Co.<\/a> in Toronto specializes in, at its most basic, making music playlists for their clients &#8212; bars, restaurants, and retailers &#8212; although they call it building soundtracks. Their old logo (that can be seen on their <a href=\"http:\/\/theplaylistcompany.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">old\/current site<\/a>) may have been music to someone&#8217;s ears but it was construction work sounds for these eyes. The new identity by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.blokdesign.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Blok Design<\/a> has crafted something much more sophisticated for them with a logo that &#8220;has stanzas of movement.&#8221; Not sure I see or read that but I do enjoy looking at the logo as well as at the color palette, the squares, and how the logo interacts with them. They are like mini groovy album covers of Jazz yore. (Wow, try saying &#8220;Jazz yore&#8221; out loud, it&#8217;s a wild word combo.) Anyway, more of those pretty squares, please. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.blokdesign.com\/#\/client\/the-playlist-company\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Not a single bright, retina-crashing color this week, with work from Zagreb, Istanbul, and Toronto&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[1074,196,590],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4695"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4695"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4695\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4695"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4695"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4695"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
