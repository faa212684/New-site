Yesterday, PayPal announced a new global campaign by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.havasworldwide.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Havas Worldwide<\/a> and introduced a new identity designed by San Francisco, CA-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fuseproject.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fuseproject<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>With the help of award-winning design firm, fuseproject and feedback from people who use our products every day, our new brand identity flexes to fit all screen sizes, from wearables and mobile to the biggest, flattest high-definition TVs.  It&#8217;ll be more legible and recognizable in both type and colors and will easily extend to be usable across the look\/feel of various systems, and in the 193 markets we serve worldwide. Connection is a motivating principle behind the redesign &mdash; connection to money, to people and between people. It was important to evoke connection that was human and approachable, not too technical.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.paypal-community.com\/t5\/PayPal-Forward\/Introducing-Our-New-Global-Brand-Campaign-and-New-Brand-Identity\/ba-p\/801348\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PayPal press release<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/paypal_2014_sketch.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for PayPal by fuseproject\" \/>\n<figcaption>Pretty sketches.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>Working closely with PayPal, we designed an identity to better express its innovative DNA and future as the leader in digital payments. The result is a system with a bolder wordmark, stronger monogram, more vibrant colors and a dynamic angle graphic that increases user perceptions of trust and innovation.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.fuseproject.com\/work\/paypal\/brand_identity\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fuseproject case study<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/paypal_2014_logo_detail.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for PayPal by fuseproject\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>We focused on two key themes for design: connection and forwardness. For connection, we designed a new monogram with overlapping double P and transparent effect to emphasize human connection. For forwardness, we strengthened the italics that have always been a part of the PayPal logo &mdash; harking back to the brand&#8217;s heritage, and affirming a forward thinking spirit.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.fuseproject.com\/work\/paypal\/brand_identity\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fuseproject case study<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/paypal_2014_logo_grid.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for PayPal by fuseproject\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo&#8217;s grid.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/DIn3M72rfdA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>A look at the process and new identity.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>I have never liked PayPal&#8217;s logo. In fact, I have never liked PayPal, period. For as long as I have used it (12 years and counting) I have dreaded logging on to my account and having to deal with the interface and structure of the site that I believe has literally not changed in the last 12 years &mdash; the dashboard measures a measly 760 pixels wide, among other limitations. The thing works, that&#8217;s for sure, and it&#8217;s helped us have a business but why it&#8217;s had such mediocre usability for so long is baffling. So, to me, the mediocre logo has always represented appropriately the mediocre experience of using PayPal. Over the last year or two, PayPal has been dressing up its gateway into your account, making it seem like, perhaps, changes are coming to the inside and for the first time I thought, &#8220;Wow, PayPal actually looks nice&#8221;. For now, the window-dressing continues with the new identity.<\/p>\n<p>The new logo is a really good evolution that unquestionably modernizes the previous logo. The double-P monogram has a nice rhythm to it and the two &#8220;P&#8221;s assemble together warmly &mdash; they are spooning. The typography, a modified Futura italic (or, actually, oblique), is a perfectly acceptable solution that reads more cleanly than the previous whateveritwas. The brighter blue hues help the logo compete better against the livelier identities of other payment gateways like Square.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/paypal_2014_tote.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for PayPal by fuseproject\" \/>\n<figcaption>Tote.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/paypal_2014_app_icon.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for PayPal by fuseproject\" \/>\n<figcaption>App icon.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/paypal_2014_register.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for PayPal by fuseproject\" \/>\n<figcaption>Cash register stamp.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>In application, there isn&#8217;t much to see, and I don&#8217;t really expect much to happen. We will most likely see the new logo just sitting there in places. Nothing wrong with that.<\/p>\n<blockquote>The voice of Powering The People Economy is expressed through People-isms: simple pieces of language that elevate our product features into moments of personal empowerment.

Unfortunately, for me, as long as they don&#8217;t improve the actual tool that lies under the aesthetic surface, I don&#8217;t see the significant improvement or powering of the people that PayPal touts.
