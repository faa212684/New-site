Sugar of any sort could silence me for hours. One of my favorite candies was Lifesavers &mdash; especially the green and red flavors. As I was walking down the candy aisle the other day, I noticed the entire Lifesavers family got a nice new logo and package update.<\/p><!--more--><p>The new logo is quite brilliant &mdash; reenforcing the lifesaver shape and refreshing the product line. Just about everything works except for the two lines added to try to give the negative &#8220;O&#8221; some depth. If you look closely, you can see the two extra lines just destroy the overall beauty of it. But besides that, the new packaging is quite lovely. Although it seems that the logo and packaging is in some confusing flux, if you see the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.candystand.com\/lifesavers\/index.do\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lifesavers home page<\/a> and check the new Lifesavers fruit tarts, you&#8217;ll see there is no two lines &mdash; <em>and<\/em> the original Lifesavers logo remains at the top of the page.<\/p>\n<p>With all the trendy &#8220;fill the space&#8221; packaging going on today, it&#8217;s easy to see why designers are drawn to certain brands (see Method, Publix Brands, &#038; Apple). Negative space and hierarchy are so critical in package design yet rarely promoted in today&#8217;s fast-paced world. I have never understood this. I keep thinking about <a href=\"http:\/\/youtube.com\/watch?v=aeXAcwriid0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this video<\/a> and how almost every package feels like this now.<\/p>\n<p>The new packaging really stands out from all the other starburst-filled packaging on the candy aisle and is a bold move for Wrigley&#8217;s, the parent company of Lifesavers. Super-sizing the candy visually reinforces the new logo &mdash; it is serendipitous. Exaggerating the Lifesaver on the packaging now allows kids to spot the packaging even easier. As I was checking out, I saw a kid say, &#8220;Mommy, I want the big candy right there!&#8221; &mdash; go figure, smart design works!<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"lifesavers_candyaisle.jpg\" src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/lifesavers_candyaisle.jpg\" width=\"450\" height=\"325\" alt=\"Candy Aisle\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>The candy aisle.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/excerpt_empty.gif\" alt=\"Excerpt Empty\" \/>","protected":false},"author":15,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,69,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/577"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/15"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=577"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/577\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=577"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=577"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=577"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
