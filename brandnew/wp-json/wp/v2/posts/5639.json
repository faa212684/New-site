Kan is the parent brand to 9 radio stations, 7 digital radio stations, 2 television channels, host to over 30 podcasts, and a thriving online presence. The identity for Kan has been designed by Tel Aviv-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.firmabrands.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Firma.<\/a> with motion graphics and video production support by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.scpg.tv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Shortcut Playground<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more-->\u2028<blockquote>Israel entirely reformed its public broadcasting, so we entirely reformed what a public communication brand is. The old IBA (Israel Broadcasting Authority) was formed at the 1960&#8217;s, and up to 2016 had a TV channel, 8 radio stations and virtually no digital activity. It was shut down by government decision due to lack of relevance and efficiency. The new substitute was meant to simply take over the current assets, but had much greater plans.<br \/><br \/>We began the branding process hand in hand with the forming of the new organization, mutually shaping its vision, actions and character. We took a major decision that effected content, form, positioning and brand alike: no more TV\/radio\/online separation. We built the brand around content and genres, regardless of medium.<\/blockquote><h3>Firma. provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kan_subbrands_old.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and On-air Graphics for Kan by Firma.\" \/>\n<figcaption>Old sub-brands.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>We named it &#8220;Kan&#8221; &#8211; Hebrew for &#8220;here&#8221;. Kan is the corporate name, a verbal indicator that ties together all sub brands and actions, and a basis for a verbal language (i.e. everything begins Here, Here is the news, only great music Here&#8230;)<br \/><br \/>The logo and the base for the whole language is simple: a line, where everything begins. In the loud, pompous media brand environment, this line stands out as self assured, fresh, free and unique. The primary colors are black and white, and they serve as a stage for the content itself. We developed a comprehensive system of platform, genre and sub brand communication, all based on the same idea. However, this very complex work resulted in a very simple, accessible and attractive language, representing the true revolution for the benefit of the public itself.<\/blockquote><h3>Firma. provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kan_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and On-air Graphics for Kan by Firma.\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kan_logo_translation.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and On-air Graphics for Kan by Firma.\" \/>\n<figcaption>How the logo reads in Hebrew.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kan_logo_grid.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and On-air Graphics for Kan by Firma.\" \/>\n<figcaption>Underlying grid.

It did almost look like a movie-logo-prop though and the corporation disappeared so there was nothing left to recycle from there. The short name given to the public-facing entity is a great transition for this brand to be more relevant and have better recognition. The wordmark is the equivalent of a custom geometric, slightly abstracted sans serif. Its clever twist is that it uses the last letter, the &#8220;n&#8221; (which in Hebrew is a long stick usually with a little serif coming out the top-left side), as the key graphic element for the identity, serving as a divider line between brand and sub-brand or brand and message, as well as being used on its own. The logo &#8212; regardless of language &#8212; is a rather pretty set of shapes and, for those who speak\/read Hebrew, it&#8217;s a lovely, simple wordmark.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kan_subbrands.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and On-air Graphics for Kan by Firma.\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kan_subbrands_big.gif\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and On-air Graphics for Kan by Firma.\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sub-brands.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>I realize judging this project is not easy because it&#8217;s hard to tell what&#8217;s going on &#8212; I speak and read a little Hebrew but more often than not I&#8217;m just staring at all these images and drawing a blank of what any of it says &#8212; but it does come across as a more coherent, better executed set of logos that share a more consistent aesthetic.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kan_guidelines.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and On-air Graphics for Kan by Firma.\" \/>\n<figcaption>Guidelines.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kan_keyframes_with_lin.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and On-air Graphics for Kan by Firma.\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kan_ads.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and On-air Graphics for Kan by Firma.\" \/>\n<figcaption>The &#8220;nun&#8221;\/line in action.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kan_sub_typography.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and On-air Graphics for Kan by Firma.\" \/>\n<figcaption>Titles for the different shows in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kan.org.il\/video\/digital.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">their video network<\/a>.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kan_stationery.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and On-air Graphics for Kan by Firma.\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stationery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kan_online_presence.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and On-air Graphics for Kan by Firma.\" \/>\n<figcaption>Online presence.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kan_app_icon.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and On-air Graphics for Kan by Firma.\" \/>\n<figcaption>App icon.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>As basic as it is, the line, (almost) always centered, does manage to become a convincing, identifiable element.

The idents are quite charming and give another dimension to the line as a kind of reflection of themes&#8230; if you wanted to get deep. Overall, this isn&#8217;t a wow-ing identity (and it probably doesn&#8217;t need to be) but a confident, serious communication platform for a broad range of outlets, from radio to tv, from funny to dramatic.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Launched earlier this year, Kan &#8212; Hebrew for &quot;here&quot; &#8212; is the consumer-facing entertainment brand of the Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation, that in 2016 replaced the Israel Broadcasting Authority, that had been founded in 1948.
