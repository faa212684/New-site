Needless to say, with every Obama critic looking for any excuse to go on the offensive, this decision certainly had vociferous opposition &mdash; all perfectly acceptable as long as it&#8217;s within reason and rationalization. As opposed to, for example, the latest spewing of inanity that the new logo of the MDA is a sign that Obama and its administration are in cahoots with the Islamic populace and are giving Iran free reign to launch missiles willy nilly.<\/p> <!--more--><p>A slew of online publications are genuinely upset that the MDA logo looks like a combination of the Obama &#8217;08 campaign logo and the star and crescent moon symbol of Islam. Others have thrown in the Iranian Space Agency logo and the Soviet Union&#8217;s hammer and sickle flag, all as part of a series of codes that determine the agenda of the Obama administration. I threw in the Boeing logo just for kicks &mdash; hey, someone has failed to point out a corporate villain in all of this &mdash; and I also added perhaps the biggest oversight by the media, the use of Trajan.

He is as pro-Islamic as they come and this symbol is a disgrace to America, as it is a hybrid of an Obama-Islamic crescent symbol.

As Logan helpfully shows, the new MDA shield appears ominously to reflect a morphing of the Islamic crescent and star with the Obama campaign logo.

If there is anything at fault with the new logo, it&#8217;s simply that it&#8217;s crappy. Granted, not as crappy as the previous one, which looks only a notch above Atari&#8217;s 1980s <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Missile_Command\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Missile Command<\/em><\/a>, but still poorly executed. The logo was designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/tmpgovernment.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TMP Government<\/a>, an agency dedicated to designing for this particular niche. It must be pointed out that the new logo does not replace the old logo, at least not yet and I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if it&#8217;s a slow replacement &mdash; right now, the new logo lives as the primary one on the web site, with the old logo appearing on the footer. Confusing, yes. The new logo is probably a tool to make the MDA look a little more sexy, make of that what you will, and TMP created a series of print ads and online games to make the agency more interesting for recruiting.<\/p>\n<blockquote>Richard Lehner, a spokesman for the Missile Defense Agency, dismissed the comparison entirely.<br \/><br \/>&#8220;It&#8217;s ridiculous,&#8221; Lehner told Fox News. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t a new logo to replace the official logo. It&#8217;s a logo developed for recruiting materials and for our public Web site. Also, it was used prior to the 2008 election and it has no link to any political campaign.&#8221;<br \/>&mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/politics\/2010\/02\/24\/missile-defense-agency-obama-campaign-logos-cause-internet-stir\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FOXNews.com<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mda_print_ads.jpg\" alt=\"Missile Defense Agency\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Print ads by TMP Government.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mda_trading_cards.jpg\" alt=\"Missile Defense Agency\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Engineer trading cards &mdash; seriously &mdash; by TMP Government.<\/p>\n<p>Hopefully we can get back to more important issues, like Tiger Woods&#8217; apologies and curling, and stop looking for shapes in clouds.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bottom\">Thanks to Noah Rothschild for first tip.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_100225_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_100225_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"574\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,70,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1043"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1043"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1043\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1043"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1043"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1043"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
