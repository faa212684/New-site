My brand impression of Radio Shack is a brand that never made the jump to the twenty-first century and, caught between becoming a hardware manufacturer or product retailer, it never caught on to the likes of Best Buy and Circuit City nor Dell, Gateway and much less Apple. In an effort to get out of this funk, Radio Shack launched yesterday a new marketing initiative to position itself as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.radioshack.com\/theshack\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Shack<\/a>. &#8220;Our friends,&#8221; they claim &#8220;call us the Shack.&#8221; With friends like that, who needs enemies?<\/p><!--more--><blockquote>&#8220;Trust is a critical attribute of any successful retailer, and the reality is that most people trust friends, not corporations. When a brand becomes a friend, it often gets a nickname &#8212; take FedEx or Coke, for example. Our customers, associates and even the investor community have long referred to RadioShack as &#8216;The Shack,&#8217; so we decided to embrace that fact and share it with the world,&#8221; said Lee Applbaum, RadioShack&#8217;s chief marketing officer.<br \/>&mdash; <em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bizjournals.com\/triad\/stories\/2009\/08\/03\/daily16.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Business Journal<\/a><\/em><\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_shack_logo_01.gif\" alt=\"The Shack Logo\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As far as I understand, the Radio Shack name and logo will NOT be replaced with this new name or &#8220;logo.&#8221; It&#8217;s simply part of a campaign to help seed this new persona, created by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bssp.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Butler, Shine, Stern and Partners<\/a>. Which is good news, because The Shack is extremely ridiculous &mdash; even more so than <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/in_brief_pizza_hut_the_hut.php\">The Hut<\/a> &mdash; and does nothing but dig Radio Shack into a bigger hole of un-coolness. The effort is in no way aided by the unimaginative graphics and &#8220;logo&#8221; that have accompanied the launch. The type is boringly simple, even annoying in its lackluster execution. And, seriously, giant laptops to create buzz in the two cities (New York and San Francisco) where there are more people with their head buried in an iPhone per capita than anywhere else? Oh, and yes, they are plain lame. Giant pumpkins on ice sound more appealing.<\/p>\n<p>Radio Shack needs a major overhaul and it should take advantage of the idiosyncratic products they carry that you can hardly find anywhere else, a sort of geek thrift store. The Shack campaign is insipid at best and harmful to the brand at worst.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_shack_image_03.jpg\" alt=\"The Shack in Action\" \/><\/p>\n<div class=\"caption\">Giant laptop in the making. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.engadget.com\/2009\/08\/03\/the-shacks-gargantuan-laptop-keyboard-adds-ominous-undertone-to\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Image source<\/a>.<\/div>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_shack_image_01.jpg\" alt=\"The Shack in Action\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_shack_image_02.jpg\" alt=\"The Shack in Action\" \/><\/p>\n<div class=\"caption\">Launch at Times Square in New York. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/93779577@N00\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Photos by Flickr user Brechtbug<\/a><\/div>\n<div class=\"bottom\">Thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/tbwazeenah.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lance K M&uuml;ller<\/a> for first tip.<\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_20090807_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_20090807_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_20090807_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_20090807_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[12,86,26],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/900"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=900"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/900\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=900"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=900"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=900"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
