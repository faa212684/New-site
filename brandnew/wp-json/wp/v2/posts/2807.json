The spirograph is something we all played with as children and still manages to create awe inspiring results from a very simple automated process &mdash; it&#8217;s a globally understood idea and one that really helps the new brand connect with it&#8217;s audience&#8217; says Tom Myers, SomeOne&#8217;s lead designer on the project.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.someoneinlondon.com\/category\/projects\/automic-progress\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SomeOne case study<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/automic_source.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Name for Automic by SomeOne\" \/>\n<figcaption>Inspiration: Spirograph, launched in 1965.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"quarter\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/automic_icon_animation.gif\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Name for Automic by SomeOne\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icon animation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/automic_icons.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Name for Automic by SomeOne\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icon variations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/automic_patterns.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Name for Automic by SomeOne\" \/>\n<figcaption>Patterns.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/automic_materials_all.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Name for Automic by SomeOne\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/automic_biz_cards.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Name for Automic by SomeOne\" \/>\n<figcaption>Identity materials.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The previous name sounded like an explosive that Jack Bauer would use so the change to a highly descriptive name is most welcome and I like that Automic didn&#8217;t shy away from the negative connotations the word &#8220;automatic&#8221; might trigger but, for businesses with hundreds of repetitive processes, having a vendor that empathizes with the problem, the positive aspects of the name far outweigh the cons. (If someone could Automic-ize the 60 or 70 e-mails I write daily I would be a happy man).<\/p>\n<p class=\"end\">The old logo was equally generic and unspecific so the use of the Spirograph as a basis for an algorithm-based range of icons indicates more of a human, or humane, touch despite that the icons are generated by a computer &mdash; most people 30 and over will recall the joy of playing with a Spirograph as kids. Although pretty to look at, the Spirograph infused graphics don&#8217;t &#8220;do&#8221; much. They are just&hellip; there. It feels as if there was one more step in translating these shapes into an identity that SomeOne could have taken this in, specially given their track record of surprising approaches. Overall, it&#8217;s a definite improvement and, in part, I am going to assume the nature of Automic&#8217;s clientele &mdash; logistics managers and IT people aren&#8217;t the most venturesome &mdash; demands a more conservative approach (which might explain the cringe-worthy image of the &#8220;superhero&#8221; on their home page, which I would bet my mortgage was not in the guidelines by SomeOne).<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 1985 near Vienna, Austria, and originally named UC4, Automic provides a software platform for a global range of businesses that focuses on &quot;automating every aspect of their business to eliminate errors, ensure compliance, reduce costs and maintain services&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,26,44],"tags":[783,769,302,530],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2807"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2807"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2807\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2807"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2807"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2807"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
