The packaging, designed by Minneapolis, MN-based <a href=\"https:\/\/buddy-buddy.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Buddy-Buddy<\/a>, revolves around a lovely, curvy wordmark in a bold, stenciled, high-contrast structure that, even if not the most novel, benefits from a great rhythm thanks to the particular letters in the name that yield a nice combination of round characters and ascenders with strong vertical strokes. Pastel colors seem to be making a bit of a comeback after a small break in the past 2 &#8211; 3 years and they look quite nice here as a contrast to the black wordmark, all in a matte finish on the packaging. I like how the wordmark sits at the bottom of the bottles, giving it a certain heaviness that grounds the minimal design. Being gender neutral, I think that the design leans a little more feminine but I would totally buy it for my mostly masculine hair care regimen (which is not much to speak of). <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/buddy-buddy.co\/Odele\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Elenita by Nice People<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_elenita.jpg\" alt=\"Elenita by Nice People\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.drinkelenita.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Elenita<\/a> is a new sparkling cocktail in a can with mezcal as the punch to a range of flavors like pinneaple jalape\u00f1o and cucumber lime basil, which sound pretty delicious, even at 5:37am as I write this. The packaging, designed by Los Angeles, CA-based <a href=\"https:\/\/nicepeopleco.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nice People<\/a>, has a fun and unexpected mix of elements that work great together on the tall can. The condensed, flared serif on a curve has a vintage feel that alludes to the long tradition of mezcal while the sun-slash-agave-plant icon on the bottom adds a touch of newness. The odd-shaped color blocks in the background at the bottom read, to me at least, like structural shapes you would fine in old <em>haciendas<\/em> (which are common spaces to be found at places where mezcal is made). But perhaps that&#8217;s too much rhapsodizing&#8230; in the end, the cans simply look like a good time waiting to happen and like a much better experience and product than a White Claw. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/nicepeopleco.com\/Elenita-Mezcal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Soft by Zan Inc.<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_softmask.jpg\" alt=\"Soft by Zan Inc.\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/besoft.nyc\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Soft<\/a> is a new skincare line specifically for men with a face mask as its first product. The packaging, designed by Brooklyn, NY-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.zangoodman.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Zan Inc.<\/a> leans heavily on the Soft name with what literally looks like the softest logo ever on Friday Likes in a pillowy, heavy-bottomed script. I really, really wish they had made a proper ligature out of the &#8220;ft&#8221; as it&#8217;s screaming to be fused like a face mask to a man&#8217;s pores &#8212; LOL, no, I have not been drinking Elenita, I came up with that simile completely sober. Anyway, despite the lack of ligature, the logo looks great in the white\/peach color combination, especially in the slightly puffy rendition on the box. 10\/10 would smear on my face. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.zangoodman.com\/soft\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"An all-packaging, all-America edition of Friday Likes this week, with work from Minneapolis, Los Angeles, and Brooklyn&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[51,11,26],"tags":[930,1784,53,1277],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8475"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=8475"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8475\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=8475"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=8475"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=8475"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
