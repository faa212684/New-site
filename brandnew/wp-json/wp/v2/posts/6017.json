Jet.com, launched in 2015, is an online-only retailer with an algorithm that aims to save you money and it ships products from both its warehouses and partner retailers; it was acquired by Walmart in 2016 and will remain as an online retailer. The Uniquely J logo and packaging were designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.elmwood.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Elmwood<\/a> in collaboration with the in-house creative team of Jet.com.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>As an online only platform, we had to think beyond the traditional retail shelf to deliver moments of &#8220;wow&#8221; across the entire consumer journey &#8212; not just through the packaging itself.<br \/><br \/>The name &#8216;Uniquely J&#8217; establishes a clear connection to Jet and sets consumer expectation from day one. Designed to elevate the everyday, the range is fun, unexpected, memorable and warm, but not jarring or intrusive. Our designs embrace a sense of curiosity and imagination, relentlessly pursuing a moment of delight &#8212; but without losing the necessary familiarity and trust consumers expect.<\/blockquote><h3>Uniquely J provided text<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/WpAJNSG_kU8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Introduction to Uniquely J.

The typography is nice but the only odd thing is the &#8220;e&#8221;, which feels very closed and tight in comparison to the other characters (especially the roundier &#8220;l&#8221; and &#8220;y&#8221;) but, in their defense, the &#8220;e&#8221; comes from the Jet.com logo as well.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/uniquely_j_packaging_various.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Uniquely J by Elmwood in Collaboration with In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>A sample of the packaging across different categories.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>There is a lot to see in the packaging, so I have broken them down into a few sections (first, some hero shots and then by product category). The packaging system has a variety of illustration styles but they are all consistent in their density and unified by a stack of squares, one for the Jet.com logo and one for the product description.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Hero shots<\/h1>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/uniquely_j_packaging_espresso.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Uniquely J by Elmwood in Collaboration with In-house\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/uniquely_j_packaging_coffee.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Uniquely J by Elmwood in Collaboration with In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Coffee (espresso and regular).<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/uniquely_j_packaging_snacks.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Uniquely J by Elmwood in Collaboration with In-house\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/uniquely_j_packaging_biscotti.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Uniquely J by Elmwood in Collaboration with In-house\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/uniquely_j_packaging_crips.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Uniquely J by Elmwood in Collaboration with In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Snacks (biscotti and crisps).<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/uniquely_j_packaging_coconut_oil_2.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Uniquely J by Elmwood in Collaboration with In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Coconut oil.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/uniquely_j_packaging_snack_bags.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Uniquely J by Elmwood in Collaboration with In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Resealable bags.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/uniquely_j_packaging_cleaner.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Uniquely J by Elmwood in Collaboration with In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Cleaners.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>In general, everything looks great, with the heavy density of the illustrations and patterns taking over all the product. It&#8217;s the antithesis of private labels, which tend to be minimal. I really like the more-is-more approach to all these. Some are better than others in terms of style but they do deliver a consistent experience and look-and-feel.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/uniquely_j_packaging_brandmarks.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Uniquely J by Elmwood in Collaboration with In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Product identifiers.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The one drawback are the product identifiers. Compared to the care and attention to detail that has gone into the illustrations and patterns these feel underdeveloped. The color combinations are odd and the typography is too plain. I understand the difficulty of deploying a consistent approach across hundreds of SKUs but if these were slightly more nuanced in their design and the way they are placed on each product, it would have been an instant home run.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/uniquely_j_packaging_copywriting.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Packaging for Uniquely J by Elmwood in Collaboration with In-house\" \/>\n<figcaption>Product copywriting.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The copywriting is a little heavy-handed on trying to be funny and clever.
