(Their site seems to have broken down in the last hour or so). This past December, they introduced a whole new look designed by Montr&eacute;al-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lg2boutique.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> Lg2boutique<\/a>.<\/p><!--more--><p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/horst_old_look.jpg\" alt=\"Horst Dusseldorf\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Sample of previous look.<\/p>\n<blockquote>Strategic research and the perceptual axes of the competitive field helped identify an important opportunity. Amongst large international players such as Hugo Boss, Versace, Strellson, Paul Smith and Ermenegildo Zegna, seduction proved to be the most ignored perceptual axis. This insight held great potential and offered the brand a credible positioning with which to enter the high-end market. <br \/>&mdash; Lg2boutique project description<\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/horst_axes.gif\" alt=\"Horst Dusseldorf\" \/><\/p>\n<blockquote>H&ouml;rst&#8217;s target likes to shop and is constantly on the lookout for that little elegant or eccentric something to reaffirm his style. He is a mature man who maintains a somewhat mysterious air. Seduction, in his view, is a game. With a slight penchant for the extravagant, he is the embodiment of the modern dandy. He takes great pleasure from his lifestyle, never slavishly bowing to the dictates of fashion. Going to the barber, learning music or taking the train for business are all things he makes time for. His entire person is seductive, rising above the everyday. He is authentic. <\/blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/horst_01.jpg\" alt=\"Horst Dusseldorf\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/horst_02.jpg\" alt=\"Horst Dusseldorf\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/horst_03.jpg\" alt=\"Horst Dusseldorf\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The old logo was a joke of triple-extended proportions. Why anyone would design such a thing or any client accept it is almost inconceivable. So anything new would be an improvement. And, boy, is this new identity an improvement. I don&#8217;t know if H&ouml;rst &mdash; now without the Dusseldorf &mdash; is competition to the big players mentioned above (Hugo Boss, Versace, et al) since I don&#8217;t think many people outside of Canada have heard of this brand but with this new identity it has every right, and every chance, to compete and be taken seriously. Everything from the icon to the labels on the clothes is sophisticated, contemporary, and, yes, even seductive &mdash; in a manly kind of way. In terms of repositioning and redesign, this is one of the best I&#8217;ve seen in a while.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/horst_04.jpg\" alt=\"Horst Dusseldorf\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/horst_05.jpg\" alt=\"Horst Dusseldorf\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/horst_06.jpg\" alt=\"Horst Dusseldorf\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/horst_07.jpg\" alt=\"Horst Dusseldorf\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/horst_08.jpg\" alt=\"Horst Dusseldorf\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/horst_09.jpg\" alt=\"Horst Dusseldorf\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/horst_10.jpg\" alt=\"Horst Dusseldorf\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/horst_11.jpg\" alt=\"Horst Dusseldorf\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/horst_13.jpg\" alt=\"Horst Dusseldorf\" \/><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"swfobject.js\"><\/script>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t<!--\n\tfunction pollSystemObj()\n\t{\n\t\tvar now = new Date();\n\t\tvar hour = now.getHours();\n\t\tvar minute = now.getMinutes();\n\t\tvar second = now.getSeconds();\n\t\tvar timeString = hour +\t'_' + minute + '_' + second;\n\t\t\/\/ create player swf object\n\t\t\/\/ <![CDATA[\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_120111_config_01.xml&#038;xyz=poll_120111_votes_01.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv1\");\n\t\tvar fo = new FlashObject(\"poll.swf?xml=poll_120111_config_02.xml&#038;xyz=poll_120111_votes_02.xml&#038;timeString\", \"poll\", \"282\", \"235\", 7);\n\t\tfo.write(\"pollDiv2\");\n\t\t\/\/ ]]&gt;\n\t}\n\t-->\n<\/script>\n<!--START DATA TABLE-->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_start.gif\" alt=\"Voting Begins\" \/>\n<table class=\"table\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tr valign=\"top\">\n        <!--VOTE CONCEPT-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv1\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n        <!--GUTTER-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_gutter\">\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/gutter.gif\" alt=\" \" \/>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<!--VOTE EXECUTION-->\n\t\t<td class=\"table_col\">\n\t\t\t<div id = \"pollDiv2\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/td>\n\t<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/images\/divider_voting_end.gif\" alt=\"Voting Ends\" \/>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,51,26],"tags":[45,585,580,105,654],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1784"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1784"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1784\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1784"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1784"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1784"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
