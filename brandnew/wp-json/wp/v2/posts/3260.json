Last year&#8217;s theme was &#8220;Molto Piano&#8221; (Much Piano) and the identity was designed by local firm <a href=\"http:\/\/lamamzelle.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">La Mamzelle &amp; Co.<\/a> with, well, a lot of piano but without actually putting literal pianos on everything. The main design element is an abstract pattern made up of black and white piano keys with the silhouette of a tail piano knocked out in different places. It&#8217;s both subtle and completely in your face. <a href=\"http:\/\/lamamzelle.com\/2014\/03\/jazz-en-rafale-2014\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Primal Kitchen by Midday<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_primalkitchen.jpg\" alt=\"Primal Kitchen by Midday\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.theprimalkitchen.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Primal Kitchen<\/a> is a new(ish) line of paleo, grain-free energy bars available in the UK. Paleo, for the uninitiated, is about eating only foods that can be hunted or gathered just like our cavemen ancestors did when refined sugars, dairy products, and processed grains weren&#8217;t on the menu. Designed by London-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.middaystudio.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Midday<\/a>, the logo and packaging have a cool paleo-aesthetic &mdash; let&#8217;s make this a thing, people! &mdash; with the cave-drawing-like line work and chunky contours. The color palette is quite pretty too. Plus, there aren&#8217;t enough woolly mammoths on packaging these days. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.middaystudio.com\/the-primal-kitchen\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project here<\/strong><\/a><\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Adventure Films by Sam Lane<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_adventurefilms.jpg\" alt=\"Adventure Films by Sam Lane\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">Based in Luxembourg, <a href=\"http:\/\/adventurefilms.lu\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Adventure Films<\/a> is an independent film production company with a killer stencil identity designed by Leeds, UK-based <a href=\"http:\/\/samlanedesign.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sam Lane<\/a>. The custom wordmark is a nice spin on the stencil approach, being applied to a rounded sans serif in a very smart and attentive way: not just by chopping off pieces with a white box placed on top of existing letterforms but by crafting each individual non-joint. Just look at those &#8220;e&#8221;s. The stencil wordmark lends itself perfectly for die-cutting in the print materials and client and designer haven&#8217;t been shy about going there. The orange and black color palette add to the boldness of the full system. <a href=\"http:\/\/samlanedesign.co.uk\/Adventure\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"From heavy piano patterns to woolly mammoths to custom stencil wordmarks, we&#8217;ve got it all this week, with work from Montr&eacute;al, London, and Leeds&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[906,729,769,437],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3260"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3260"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3260\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3260"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3260"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3260"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
