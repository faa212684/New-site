Owned by the state, through its GRUPO SEPI, Correos employs over 53,000 people that help deliver more than 69 million packages and 2.7 million letters annually with a fleet of nearly 15,000 vehicles, including almost 500 electric vehicles. Recently, Correos introduced a new identity designed by Barcelona and Madrid, Spain-based <a href=\"https:\/\/en.summa.es\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Summa<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>Correos, national postal service, is a brand with more than 350 years. Witness of all the changes that spanish society has undergone, it has evolved to adapt to them and to technological advances by launching new courier and parcel services. However, society felt Correos as an endearing brand, traditional but not at all innovative. That&#8217;s why Correos needed to adapt its identity to reflect its own reality: a company that has been innovating in services since 1756 and continues to do so.<br \/><br \/>To embrace its essence and communicate it in a more contemporary and direct way to its audience, Correos counted on Summa to develop the brand project. Our task was to update the brand and position Correos as another player in the current industry, leaving behind the times where the brand expressed itself only in its fleet, facades and mailboxes, and covering every outcome across physical and digital media.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/en.summa.es\/case\/correos\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Summa project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/correos_spain_logo_evolution.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Correos by Summa\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<div class=\"video-container\"><video controls controlsList=\"nodownload\" poster=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/correos_spain_logo_animation.jpg\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/correos_spain_logo_animation.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo evolution, static and animated.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>We started the project with the study of the symbol, the most important identity element of the brand. The symbol appears today in many more applications than in previous decades, but could not behave in the desired way in small or digital scenarios. Our strategic proposal consisted of applying more oxygen between its lines, redefining some of its elements, and lightening its shapes to turn it into a flexible symbol.<br \/><br \/>For this, we simplify the morphology of the crown, but maintaining the symbolic recognition of the brand. Anchoring the redesign in the most recognizable element was essential, since the cornamusa is even used as a symbol of urban navigation as well as others such as the Red Cross or the Spanish Police.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/en.summa.es\/case\/correos\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Summa project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/correos_spain_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Correos by Summa\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/correos_spain_logo_inverse.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Correos by Summa\" \/>\n<figcaption>Inverse.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The biggest change about the logo is that it has completely dropped its wordmark, which is good because the old wordmark was a little wonky with the italic &#8220;C&#8221; getting its cursive on with the &#8220;o&#8221; next to it. Going 100% with the icon only is a bold move and few companies and organizations can pull it off but Correos seems to be poised to do it well with an icon that has been around for 42 years and always linked to the word &#8220;Correos&#8221; in the past so it&#8217;s not a huge leap at all to believe that the majority of the audience &#8212; in this case the whole country &#8212; will be able to recognize it. The changes to the icon will probably even pass unperceived as the core structure and elements remain in play. The &#8220;cornamusa&#8221; (or the trumpet-looking thing) remains mostly intact with a few improvements while the crown has received the most modifications which are fine for reproducibility but I wonder if it lost its crown-ness? Removing the circles for the jewels makes it simpler but I think removing the bling is not ideal nor is the straightening of the curves &#8212; it loses a couple of key visual triggers for &#8220;crown&#8221;. Nonetheless, the overall appearance and recognizability of the logo remains and now performs better across mediums, so that&#8217;s always a win.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/correos_spain_logo_in_all_applications.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo in, like, a ton of applications.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/correos_spain_logo_subbrands.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Seals.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/correos_spain_stationery.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Correos by Summa\" \/>\n<figcaption>Stationery.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>An important element in the renewal of the visual identity for Correos is its new typeface. Together with Monotype, we designed a new font exclusively for Correos that we have named Cartero (Postman) in honour of these emblematic professionals that has shaped the company since its early days.<br \/><br \/>The new typeface brings elegance and modernity, and reinforces the essential attributes of the new Correos. Its simplicity ensures the proper functioning of it in all types of messages (from corporate to commercial, from digital to traditional environments) and at the same time will make it last over time without losing relevance.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/en.summa.es\/case\/correos\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Summa project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\" style=\"padding-bottom: 33.25%;\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/correos_spain_type_01.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<hr \/>\n<div class=\"video-container\" style=\"padding-bottom: 50.25%;\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/correos_spain_type_02.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<hr \/>\n<div class=\"video-container\" style=\"padding-bottom: 50.25%;\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/correos_spain_type_03.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Custom type family.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The type family is okay.

Especially in recent years, the company has expanded exponentially the portfolio of products and services offered to citizens.<br \/><br \/>For all this, and taking into account that Correos communicates through multiple channels, it was essential to ensure consistency between the messages. To do this, we created an additional identification element: the label.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/en.summa.es\/case\/correos\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Summa project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/correos_spain_the_label_element.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Label element.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>We created a visual system based on the label, the fundamental element in sending and receiving of letters and parcels. A modular and flexible system that identifies all the pieces of communication of the brand in all its spectrum.<br \/><br \/>The label adapts to the different forms of communication, both the main brand and its sub-brands, and will be one of the elements that will characterize the identity of the Correos, as they are today without any doubt the postman or the mailbox.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/en.summa.es\/case\/correos\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Summa project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video controls controlsList=\"nodownload\" poster=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/correos_spain_identity_system.jpg\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/correos_spain_identity_system.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Layout system.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/correos_spain_layouts_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Correos by Summa\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/correos_spain_layouts_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Correos by Summa\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/correos_spain_layouts_03.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Correos by Summa\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sample layouts.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The concept of the &#8220;label&#8221; as the main identity element for applications makes sense, even if it&#8217;s not the most exciting. It creates a simple device that in its heavy use of yellow with the logo neatly centered at the top is bound to become easily recognizable. The supporting imagery might need to be less generic and random but maybe in due time that will fall in line a little better.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/correos_spain_packaging.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Correos by Summa\" \/>\n<figcaption>Cool hero image, not actual packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/correos_spain_packaging_tape_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Correos by Summa\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/correos_spain_packaging_tape_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Correos by Summa\" \/>\n<figcaption>Packaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>Not the most exciting packaging or labeling.
