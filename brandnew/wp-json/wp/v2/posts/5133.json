We help people see the world more clearly so they can make a positive difference for humanity. Synthesys, our award-winning cognitive computing platform, can rapidly read data from any source, resolve what&#8217;s valuable and what&#8217;s not, and reason using a dynamic knowledge graph, which helps enterprises, financial services institutions, government agencies and healthcare organizations reveal concealed relationships, risks and opportunities. Digital Reasoning is headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee, with offices in Washington, D.C., New York and London.&#8221;<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/digital_reasoning_logo_rationale.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Digital Reasoning by Golden Spiral\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo rationale.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/digital_reasoning_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Digital Reasoning by Golden Spiral\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/digital_reasoning_logo_grid.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Digital Reasoning by Golden Spiral\" \/>\n<figcaption>Grid (that is actually useful and interesting).<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/digital_reasoning_business_cards.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Digital Reasoning by Golden Spiral\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business cards.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/digital_reasoning_icons.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Digital Reasoning by Golden Spiral\" \/>\n<figcaption>Icon set.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"(Est. 2000) &quot;Digital Reasoning is a leader in cognitive computing.
