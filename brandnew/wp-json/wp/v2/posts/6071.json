Benefit cards are a common part of an employee&#8217;s payment where each employer defines the benefits that the card allows &#8212; used only for gas or groceries or for everything &#8212; and there are multiple financial institutions that control these cards and become the link between employer, employee, and the establishments that accept them. By providing a digital-only &#8220;card&#8221;, Bene&#8217;s fees are lower and more in tune with today&#8217;s smartphone-driven lifestyle. The identity for Bene has been designed by Rio de Janeiro-based <a href=\"https:\/\/plau.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Plau<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>We twisted and turned the letters to make them follow the b, a thumbs up sign that is Brazil&#8217;s most well known symbol for Ok. It helped that result also comes across as slightly high-tech.<br \/><br \/>We crafted a verbal and visual style that speaks &#8211; with a witty, human voice &#8211; to the brand&#8217;s key audiences: beneficiaries, companies and restaurants. The illustrations were a nice touch to get the point across: not needing to be in a line can make your day much more fun!<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/plau.co\/en\/projects\/bene\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Plau project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bene_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Bene by Plau\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"\"><video controls autoplay loop><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/bene_icon.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Monogram animation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>I&#8217;ll admit upfront that I am smitten by both the full wordmark and the standalone &#8220;b&#8221; monogram that doubles as an abstract thumbs up. The typographic structure is not something I would normally be drawn too &#8212; damn you stemless &#8220;n&#8221;s! &#8212; but here it works perfectly to create a simple, friendly, tech-looking-without-wanting-to-be-another-Airbnb logo that is distinct and memorable.
