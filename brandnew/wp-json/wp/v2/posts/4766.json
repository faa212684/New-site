Its air of sophistication comes courtesy of Montr\u00e9al, Quebec-based <a href=\"http:\/\/fivethousandfingers.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fivethousand Fingers<\/a> through an airy identity punctuated by a stunning &#8220;CC&#8221; monogram paired perfectly with a book-weight serif. The brief weight contrast between icon and wordmark is a rare case that works where they are almost similar but the wordmark just enough so to stand out. The applications aren&#8217;t groundbreaking but you can&#8217;t argue with strong typesetting. <a href=\"http:\/\/fivethousandfingers.com\/portfolio\/collected-coffee\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">HOTSHOT by Pentagram<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_hotshot.jpg\" alt=\"HOTSHOT by Pentagram\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.teamhotshot.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">HOTSHOT<\/a> is a new concoction invented by a neuroscientist and a PhD in neurobiology that helps prevent cramps during long bouts of exercise. As someone who regularly cramps at mile 23 of a marathon I&#8217;m ordering me some right now and as someone who likes design I am adding it to Friday Likes today. Designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pentagram.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pentagram<\/a>&#8216;s Daniel Weil and Michael Bierut, the tight little package looks like a kick-ass can of pepper spray &#8212; since cramps <em>are<\/em> an emergency I&#8217;m cool with this mental association of my own &#8212; with the alarming red cap, black body, and bold wordmark. The custom inline typography has a great, unexpected structure and, although a little confusing, it&#8217;s fun that &#8220;HOT&#8221; can be read in two directions. (I wonder if they tried splitting the &#8220;S&#8221; into red and white to accentuate the double read). Overall, this looks like science and sports crammed into a tiny package and that&#8217;s hot. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pentagram.com\/#\/blog\/131940\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"red_100 rb_mar_large rb_pad_small rb_5_r100\">Edinburgh International Book Festival by Tangent<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_edinburghfestival.jpg\" alt=\"Edinburgh International Book Festival by Tangent\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\">Celebrated since 1983, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.edbookfest.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Edinburgh International Book Festival<\/a> now encompasses over 700 events and welcomes over 220,000 people. This year&#8217;s event features a groovy identity designed by Glasgow-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tangentgraphic.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tangent<\/a> with illustrations by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.craigandkarl.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Craig &amp; Karl<\/a> that deliberately hints at the 1960s psychedelic art and mixes it with the &#8220;style of 60s modernist science and psychology textbooks&#8221;. I&#8217;ve never seen a 60s modernist science and psychology textbook but if it&#8217;s anything like these, then put me down for a subscription. The appeal of the identity is more about the colorful and dense illustrations than the design but the backdrop application does prove that a good illustration used well can be awesome, as is the case here. There isn&#8217;t an enduring precedent for book festivals to look this good, so it&#8217;s great to see this project start to establish one. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.creativereview.co.uk\/cr-blog\/2016\/june\/craig-karl-and-tangents-psychedelic-identity-for-edinburgh-international-book-festival\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>See full project<\/strong><\/a><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Back from a forced hiatus with simple, bold, and exuberant work from Montr\u00e9al, New York\/London, and Glasgow&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[11,26],"tags":[597,906,134],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4766"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4766"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4766\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4766"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4766"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4766"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
