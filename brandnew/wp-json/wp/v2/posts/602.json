Like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/mica_finds_itself.php\">MICA<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/this_is_not_your_parents_art_s.php\">Ringling College of Art and Design<\/a>, just to name a couple we have reviewed here, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.massart.edu\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MassArt<\/a> is embracing the influence that a revitalized identity can have in the perception of an arts and design institution. This is specially important for a 135-year-old institution &mdash; the first and only independent public college of art in the United States, and the first art school to grant a degree &mdash; that has to compete with dozens of other schools that don&#8217;t carry the weight of more than a century.<\/p><!--more--><p>Working with brand consultancy <a href=\"http:\/\/www.minelli.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Minelli, Inc.<\/a>, MassArt engaged in an eighteen-month-long planning and assessment process that resulted in a strategic marketing plan that aimed to raise the institution&#8217;s profile, and one of the key elements to achieve this would be its identity. MassArt assembled a committee of faculty, staff, students, foundation directors, and trustees to oversee the project, who selected <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mothdesign.net\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Moth Design<\/a> &mdash; which features four MassArt alumni &mdash; out of seven design firms that responded to requests for proposal. With a new institution name, Massachusetts College of Art and Design (formally established in October of 2007), and a clear sense of renewal, MassArt established objectives for the new identity:<\/p>\n<blockquote>To present MassArt consistently and with confidence.<br \/>To represent a level of skill, quality, and creativity appropriate for a leading college of art and design.<br \/>To establish a visual signature that is distinct and recognizable as Massachusetts College of Art and Design.<br \/>To retain the significant brand equity in &#8220;MassArt&#8221; while firmly establishing the college&#8217;s new formal name.<br \/>To reflect the energy and spirit of the individuals that comprise MassArt&#8217;s diverse community.<\/blockquote>\n<p>The new identity is a creatively handsome solution. It uses a single graphic device to become memorable and unique without having to resort to visual pyrotechnics that would somehow, magically signal a fountain of creativity flowing from this corner of Massachusetts. Cropping the &#8220;S&#8221; at the same angle as the &#8220;A&#8221; is a rather enjoyable conceptual solution as it unites and blends the notion of Art with the place. Or as MassArt explains it:<\/p>\n<blockquote>The simple device of cropping the &#8220;S&#8221; in &#8220;Mass&#8221; on the same angle as the &#8220;A&#8221; in &#8220;Art&#8221; visually propels &#8220;Art&#8221; to the foreground. The &#8220;Art&#8221; advancing to the foreground of &#8220;Mass&#8221; represents an institution driving art and design to the forefront of public consciousness.<\/blockquote>\n<p>What&#8217;s great about this wordmark, is that it really doesn&#8217;t need to be too rationalized, it simply works as an identifier that stands apart from other educational institution logos. And the rest of the identity system is equally well thought out and considered, establishing a consistently varied system through flexibility in configuration and color &mdash; and those knocked out logos that look pretty great.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/massart_lockups.png\" alt=\"Alternate configurations.\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Alternate configurations.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/massart_color.png\" alt=\"Color palette.\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Color palette.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/massart_knockout.png\" alt=\"Knock-out usage.\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Knock-out usage.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/massart_one-color.png\" alt=\"One-color usage.\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>One-color usage.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/massart_signage.jpg\" alt=\"Signage rendering.\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Signage rendering.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Apart from the identity basics, Moth Design developed a system for collateral materials that revolves around the 23-degree angle established by the &#8220;A&#8221; &mdash; which is originally <a href=\"http:\/\/typography.com\/fonts\/font_overview.php?productLineID=100008\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gotham<\/a>, for anyone keeping count &mdash; and exploits it to great effect. Using the angle to form fields of color, or as a holding device and paired with a &#8220;screen&#8221; pattern of interspersed, even lines set at a perpendicular angle of 67 degrees, glued together by Interstate and Sabon as the house fonts, the system provides flexibility while establishing consistency and giving the school a controlled, ever-so-slightly edgier look that manages to convey their commitment to growing the institution and moving it forward without losing sight of its heritage and long history.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/massart_bizcard.jpg\" alt=\"Business Card\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/massart_letterhead.jpg\" alt=\"Letterhead\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Details of business card and letterhead.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/massart_id.jpg\" alt=\"Identity standards manual\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/massart_id_det.jpg\" alt=\"Identity standards manual detail\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>Identity standards manual.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/massart_brochure.jpg\" alt\"President's Report brochure\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/massart_brochure_det_01.jpg\" alt\"President's Report brochure\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/massart_brochure_det_02.jpg\" alt\"President's Report brochure\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"small\"><strong>President&#8217;s Report brochure, and details.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>This is a really great identity, that has been expertly crafted and conceived to be solid, recognizable and expandable &mdash; a task now headed by MassArt&#8217;s brand new and first-ever marketing office.
