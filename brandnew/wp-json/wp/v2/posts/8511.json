And the main reason are the materials used, most of them not recyclable. This is why at <a href=\"https:\/\/honextmaterial.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Honext<\/a> we have developed and patented a process, product and application, which transforms the primary sludge generated by the paper industry into a new cellulose-based material, sustainable, versatile, with excellent properties (reaction to fire, moisture, acoustics, mechanical resistance, non-toxic) to be used as interior partitions in construction. The material is recyclable and we are currently working on obtaining the Cradle-to-Cradle silver certificate. Right now we are in full implementation of the first production factory, located in a Waste Treatment Center in Vacarisses, Barcelona. It has an annual production capacity of 2,000 m3 of panels. The manufacturing process, in addition to using the sludge from paper mills as raw material, incorporates water coming from the landfill leachate, as well as methane and electricity generated from waste.&#8221;<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/honext_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Honext by Firma\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\" style=\"padding-bottom: 64.25%;\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/honext_logo_construction.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo construction.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/honext_product.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Honext by Firma\" \/>\n<figcaption>Product.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/honext_product_in_use.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Honext by Firma\" \/>\n<figcaption>Product in use.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/honext_logo_on_product.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Honext by Firma\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo on product.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/honext_photography.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Honext by Firma\" \/>\n<figcaption>Photography.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\" style=\"padding-bottom: 64.25%;\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/honext_website.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Website.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\" style=\"padding-bottom: 64.25%;\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/honext_system.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Layout system.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/honext_layouts.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Honext by Firma\" \/>\n<figcaption>Layouts.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"(Est. 2011, previously Biprocel) &quot;In Europe, each citizen generates an average of 1.78 tons of construction waste per year, being this industry responsible for one third of all global waste.
