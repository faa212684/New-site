The <em>Global Cycles<\/em> concept of the new identity illustrates an internationally credible, agile and innovative actor that operates in a stable manner and exerts influence in a tumultuous world. The undulations of the globe-shaped basic blue logo denote things that affect Finland and that Finland can influence through the Foreign Service. The identity is designed to be flexible for different uses and adapts to both dignified representation and marketing-oriented needs.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/formin.finland.fi\/public\/default.aspx?contentid=371033&#038;contentlan=2&#038;culture=en-US\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ministry for Foreign Affairs announcement<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/251360875?title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" width=\"940\" height=\"529\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo presentation.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ministry_of_foreign_affairs_finland_logo_color_versions.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland by 358\" \/>\n<figcaption>Full- and single-color versions.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ministry_of_foreign_affairs_finland_logo.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland by 358\" \/>\n<figcaption>Pulsing logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The identity tool runs a real-time rendered 3d model of the globe based on WebGL.

The lion, from Finland&#8217;s coat of arms, was simply slapped on top of a generic globe graphic and paired with a bland serif wordmark underneath and a bland sans serif even more blandly set on a curve. The new logo is exactly the kind of stuff I would expect from Finland&#8217;s government. It&#8217;s slick, it&#8217;s graphic, and it&#8217;s boldly executed. The lion has been redrawn for better reproduction not only at small sizes but also to withstand the changing textures of the globe and its off-center position somehow makes it more bad-ass. In its main, static, full-color application the logo is attractive and engaging enough and it could have probably been left at that but the data-driven aspect adds a great layer of both conceptual meaning and graphic application. The wordmark is contemporary and serious with a number of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.typemates.com\/news\/ministry-for-foreign-affairs-of-finland\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cool modifications<\/a> to TypeMates&#8217; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.typemates.com\/fonts\/cera-pro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cera Pro<\/a>.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ministry_of_foreign_affairs_finland_custom_font_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland by 358\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ministry_of_foreign_affairs_finland_custom_font_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland by 358\" \/>\n<figcaption>Cera MFAF, a customized version of TypeMates&#8217; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.typemates.com\/fonts\/cera-pro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cera Pro<\/a>.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ministry_of_foreign_affairs_finland_business_card.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland by 358\" \/>\n<figcaption>Business card.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ministry_of_foreign_affairs_finland_publication_templates.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland by 358\" \/>\n<figcaption>Publication templates.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ministry_of_foreign_affairs_finland_publication_samples.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland by 358\" \/>\n<figcaption>Sample publication.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/ministry_of_foreign_affairs_finland_presentation.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland by 358\" \/>\n<figcaption>Presentation to the media.
