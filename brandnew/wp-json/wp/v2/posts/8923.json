Starting with a trial of 200 e-bikes &#8212; that, for the initial trial period, must be picked up in and brought back to London&#8217;s Islington district &#8212; and with 1,000 additional e-bikes expected to roll out across the rest of the city, riders can use the e-bike for 20 minutes at no cost and can then either park it or keeping riding for \u00a30.12p per minute. HumanForest&#8217;s e-bikes are zero-emission, powered by renewable energy, and require no docking stations &#8212; swappable battery packs are charged remotely and replaced as needed by the HumanForest team, whose service vehicles are also electric and zero-emission. The company&#8217;s name alludes to trees&#8217; ability to remove CO2 from the atmosphere so if humans opted to ride their e-bike they would emit zero greenhouse gases, ergo reducing the amount of CO2 in the air, double-ergo, becoming a human forest. The identity for HumanForest has been designed by Auckland, New Zealand-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.studiosouth.co.nz\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">South<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><blockquote>A collection of whimsical animated characters personify the brand concept and create a sense of community and collective effort. Key design considerations around colour and messaging represented an opportunity to capture classic British culture and ensure the brand complements the environment &#8211; a definitive aesthetic point of difference to competing brands. The primary green (inspired by historic British racing hues) gives the bikes an understated and fashionable look. A supporting palette of organic tones look to add a natural feel across digital and physical outputs. The logotype and core messaging is set in Haptik, offering a charming set of letterforms to communicate the light-hearted copy.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.studiosouth.co.nz\/projects\/human-forest\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">South project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/humanforest_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for HumanForest by South\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>As far as the official logo goes, there isn&#8217;t much to it &#8212; it&#8217;s unapologetically <a href=\"https:\/\/www.grillitype.com\/typeface\/gt-haptik\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GT Haptik<\/a> out of the box, typeset, and done. Even on their website, the logo is live text (as opposed to an SVG or PNG file).

As minimal as they are, they are full of personality, especially in motion but even static. Their deadpan presence and walking swagger full of confidence and determination is absolutely delightful and I love how they each have different cadences &#8212; the tall boi, with the slow, long strides is my favorite. The relative silliness of the trees works particularly well when offset by the rich dark green color that permeates the brand in a regal-like hue that could easily come across as stuffy or snobby but that&#8217;s impossible when you have trees with legs as your primary brand element.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\" style=\"padding-bottom: 67.25%;\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/humanforest_identity_elements.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Identity elements.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\" style=\"padding-bottom: 67.25%;\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/humanforest_animation_breaking_into_layouts.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Illustrations and messaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\" style=\"padding-bottom: 67.25%;\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/humanforest_social_media_posts.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Social media posts.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/humanforest_app_screen.gif\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for HumanForest by South\" \/>\n<figcaption>App screen.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/humanforest_advertising.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for HumanForest by South\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/humanforest_advertising_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for HumanForest by South\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<div class=\"video-container\" style=\"padding-bottom: 67.25%;\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/humanforest_shelter_animated_ad.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<hr \/>\n<div class=\"video-container\" style=\"padding-bottom: 67.25%;\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/humanforest_shelter_animated_ad_02.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Out of home advertising.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The applications are very straightforward&#8230;
