In their <a href=\"https:\/\/dopemagazine.com\/flower-collective-co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">5,000-square-foot facility<\/a> with 16 employees, The Flower Collective specializes in bubble hash &#8212; a cannabis concentrate made using ice water &#8212; and offers concentrates as well as joints and blunts. After spending some time as a medical cannabis provider, The Flower Collective is now a licensed recreational cannabis supplier and has introduced a new identity and packaging designed by Boulder, CO-based <a href=\"https:\/\/castirondesign.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cast Iron Design<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!--more--><figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\" style=\"padding-bottom: 54%;\"><video controls controlsList=\"nodownload\" poster=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_flower_collective_bubble_hash_made.jpg\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_flower_collective_bubble_hash_made.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>How bubble hash is made.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\" style=\"padding-bottom: 39.25%;\"><video controls controlsList=\"nodownload\" poster=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_flower_collective_bubble_joint_made.jpg\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_flower_collective_bubble_joint_made.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>How bubble joints are made.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<blockquote>The goal of the brand identity was to create an aesthetic that could quickly grab the attention of timid tourists while also establishing a rich personality for loyal locals. The color system of near-neon accents over deep cobalt was inspired, in part, by &#8217;60s blacklight posters, giving the packaging an aesthetic influenced by cannabis culture without falling into the same color palettes and visual tropes common with competitors. The bold typography system, custom icons, and creative copywriting help express The Flower Collective&#8217;s unique location, product qualities, and sense of humor.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/castirondesign.com\/work\/the-flower-collective\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cast Iron Design project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_flower_collective_logo_previous.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for The Flower Collective by Cast Iron Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Although presented as a new logo &#8212; given that it&#8217;s a new recreational cannabis brand &#8212; the company did have previous logos: on the left, the original, and on the right, an earlier variation of the new logo also by Cast Iron Design.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_flower_collective_logo.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for The Flower Collective by Cast Iron Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\" style=\"background-color:#130b78;\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_flower_collective_logo_animation.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<hr \/>\n<div class=\"video-container\" style=\"background-color:#130b78;\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls controlsList=\"nodownload\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_flower_collective_logo_animation_round.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Logo animations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The logo features a nice abstract rendition of a flower in a tightly executed, not-thin, not-thick stroke style that pairs with the wordmark of equal thickness.

And things only get more interesting from here&#8230;<\/p>\n<blockquote>The Flower Collective&#8217;s facilities are located in Nederland, Colorado. Ned is a town of only 1,500 residents nestled in the Rocky Mountains against a large reservoir. It&#8217;s known for having a distinct culture and an abundance of character packed into a small area. We played off of their &#8220;Ned cred&#8221; by creating an icon set where each icon represents a landmark or characteristic of Nederland.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/castirondesign.com\/work\/the-flower-collective\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cast Iron Design project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_flower_collective_pattern.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for The Flower Collective by Cast Iron Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Pattern.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_flower_collective_pattern_legend.png\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for The Flower Collective by Cast Iron Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Pattern legend.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>For a town of so few people, Nederland sure is weird. Among other quirks, they celebrate, since 2002, <a href=\"https:\/\/frozendeadguydays.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Frozen Dead Guy Days<\/a>, which honors the frozen body of a Norwegian man that resides in the town. <a href=\"https:\/\/frozendeadguydays.org\/aboutfdgd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">It&#8217;s a long story<\/a>. Point being, the uniqueness of the town is charmingly captured in the brand pattern that features all kind of local references. Its wobbly hand-drawn style provides a fun contrast to the crisp logo and a backdrop for all of the packaging.<\/p>\n<blockquote>Creative copywriting was a point of emphasis, injected into nearly every touchpoint. The basic guidelines are to keep things short, avoid negativity, and draw a little inspiration from a cannabis-induced state of mind, with the hope of inducing a smile, smirk, laugh, or eye roll.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/castirondesign.com\/work\/the-flower-collective\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cast Iron Design project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_flower_collective_messaging.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for The Flower Collective by Cast Iron Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Core messaging.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_flower_collective_booklet_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for The Flower Collective by Cast Iron Design\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_flower_collective_booklet_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for The Flower Collective by Cast Iron Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Promo booklet.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The copywriting is literally a group of stoned friends writing corporate copy and Cast Iron nailed the tone and absurdity.

What&#8217;s kind of interesting about the box is that none of the elements really go together but, yet, they do. There is no reason the pattern should exist both in bright colors and then as tone-on-tone, there is no reason to add the extra groovy typeface, there is no reason to introduce a condensed typeface or wraparound label or embossed icon but, in the end, it packs a punch and it works.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_flower_collective_packaging_joint_and_blunt_tubes_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for The Flower Collective by Cast Iron Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Joint and blunt tubes.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_flower_collective_packaging_blunt_tubes_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for The Flower Collective by Cast Iron Design\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_flower_collective_packaging_blunt_tubes_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for The Flower Collective by Cast Iron Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Blunt tubes.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_flower_collective_packaging_joint_tubes_01.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for The Flower Collective by Cast Iron Design\" \/>\n<figcaption>Joint tubes.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The tubes, having less real estate and more limitations of what you can do on them are more immediately successful than the boxes, with the pattern adding a nice bit of texture and the product descriptor clear and big.

To boot, Cast Iron Design has done a great job in minimizing the carbon footprint of where the goodies come from and put together a surprisingly fun video that highlights each vendor&#8217;s environmental benefits and distance from The Flower Collective.<\/p>\n<blockquote>In addition to design, we&#8217;ve carefully selected materials, processes, and production partners for a multitude of print and promotional items. Special attention is paid to distance since transportation\/shipping is a significant contributor to an object&#8217;s carbon footprint. Utilizing stateside vendors also helps ensure employees are paid a more reasonable wage (garment workers in developing countries are some of the lowest paid laborers in the world). It&#8217;s by no means foolproof, but sourcing as locally as possible is a key component of sustainable systems thinking. Although individually packaged products are inherently unsustainable, The Flower Collective is taking marked steps in the right direction.<\/blockquote><h3><a href=\"https:\/\/castirondesign.com\/work\/the-flower-collective\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cast Iron Design project page<\/a><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"full\"><div class=\"video-container\"><video controls controlsList=\"nodownload\" poster=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_flower_collective_sustainability_video.jpg\"><source src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/the_flower_collective_sustainability_video.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.<\/video><\/div>\n<figcaption>Sustainability video.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">Overall, this is one of those projects where you can tell everyone had fun working on it, including the client.
