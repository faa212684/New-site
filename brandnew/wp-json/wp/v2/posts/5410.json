The new logo has a few too many things going: the extra pointy &#8220;M&#8221; with a large counterspace, the bar-only &#8220;E&#8221;, and the split &#8220;O&#8221;. Since the application revolves around the &#8220;O&#8221;, the logo would have benefitted from maybe having a normal &#8220;E&#8221; or a less pronounced &#8220;M&#8221;, allowing the &#8220;O&#8221; to be the center of attention&#8230; or perhaps applying a stencil approach to all the letters. Overall, the logo has a good presence but it&#8217;s a little confusing once you break it down.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/metro_poland_identity_elements.png\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Metro by UVMW\" \/>\n<figcaption>Identity elements.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/metro_poland_variations.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for Metro by UVMW\" \/>\n<figcaption>Variations on how the &#8220;O&#8221; integrates content.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The most interesting part about the logo is how the &#8220;O&#8221; can open up to include messaging, imagery, or the graded lines key graphic. The split &#8220;O&#8221; functions like a parenthesis, holding in place whatever is put in between. The execution could somehow have more finesse&#8230; maybe it&#8217;s the weird blue or the spacing between all the elements.

It&#8217;s all in Polish, but you&#8217;ll get the gist.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">In application, a set of old-school lines that go from thick to thin are the key ingredient and I&#8217;m not sure why but I find the device to be oddly cool, especially in motion, with the lines thickening and thinning as they enter and exit the screen. I don&#8217;t think the orange and blue colors are right for this nor is the Art Deco-ish font used but there is a solid foundation here for a future evolution with more interesting colors and slightly more ambitious motion behavior.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Launched in late 2016, Metro is a lifestyle universal channel in Poland &quot;directed to a wide audience interested in healthy lifestyle and sports, looking for interesting entertainment, accurate information and cultural journalism.&quot; Majority-owned by one of Poland&apos;s largest media and&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,66,26],"tags":[873,290,41,546,42],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5410"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=5410"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5410\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=5410"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=5410"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=5410"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
