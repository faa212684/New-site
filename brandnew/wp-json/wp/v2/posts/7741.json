Their identity, designed by Vancouver, Canada-based <a href=\"https:\/\/glasfurdandwalker.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Glasfurd &amp; Walker<\/a>, reflects the quality of the product through an elegant, classic script wordmark that almost feels like it&#8217;s existed for decades, especially when used in the kraft bags. The boxes are quite nice too but I would have loved to see the same stark simplicity of the bags. The kraft, brown, and tan color palette has a great earthy feel and I like how the typography isn&#8217;t full on vintage but rather more contemporary, mixing Commercial Type&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/commercialtype.com\/catalog\/styrene\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Styrene<\/a> with Or Type&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/ortype.is\/specimen\/or_lemmen\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Or Lemmen<\/a>.

The name references Brighton&#8217;s railway station, which has only 8 platforms &#8212; so the non-existent 9th platform symbolizes &#8220;the dream of a better work-life balance&#8221;. The identity, designed by Brighton-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.studiomakgill.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Studio Makgill<\/a>, revolves (literally) around a custom typeface made to reference the split-flap notice boards of train stations, best appreciated in the logo, with the number 9, slowly making its way up to reveal number 0, which in turn would serve as an &#8220;O&#8221; to read as &#8220;PLATFORM&#8221; but because we are such developed living beings we are able to read the full as &#8220;PLATFORM 9&#8221;, which makes this a very satisfying logo. There is not much in application, but the simple technique of split-flap font creates a bold and consistent element to establish a distinct brand for this co-working space. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.studiomakgill.com\/platf9rm\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"friday_likes\">Corphes by Luminous Design Group<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/friday_likes_corphes.jpg\" alt=\"Corphes by Luminous Design Group\" \/>\n<p style=\"margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.corphes.gr\/en\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Corphes<\/a> is a brand of organic products, from jams to spices to teas, from ingredients harvested in Deskati, Grevena, in Greece, the country&#8217;s highest altitude farming area. The identity, designed by Athens, Greece-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.luminous.gr\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Luminous Design Group<\/a>, plays off of the Greek meaning of Corphes, which is &#8220;top&#8221;, by creating a set of printed materials that have been scored at odd angles and can be folded to create low, wide-spanning, little mountains. The folds have been gold foil stamped to emulate the sun hitting the mountain&#8217;s ridges and it looks glorious against the dark papers selected. I&#8217;ll admit that this is more print production porn than anything but it&#8217;s quite commendable that a print production trick can be transformed into an identity system across multiple applications. <span class=\"pagination_divider\"><\/span><span class=\"small_caps\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/80199077\/Corphes-Corporate-Identity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full project<\/a><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Some simple and straightforward projects this week, with work from Vancouver, Brighton, and Athens&#8230;.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[51,11,26],"tags":[1706,1682,319,1178,53],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7741"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=7741"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7741\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=7741"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=7741"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=7741"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
