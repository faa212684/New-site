In 2005, the Museum relocated to the West Queen West Art + Design District in downtown Toronto, in the heart of one of North America&#8217;s most dynamic arts communities. Since arriving on Queen Street West the Museum became a stimulus for the neighbourhood&#8217;s art community, for local businesses and for contemporary art and artists in Canada. In 2015 the Museum of Contemporary Art_Toronto_Canada announced a unique partnership with Castlepoint Numa to create a new home for the Museum. The museum will be moving its operations to 158 Sterling Road where it will occupy the first five floors of the iconic Tower Automotive building. The new Museum of Contemporary Art_Toronto_Canada will open its doors in 2017.<\/p><!--more--><figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/Museum-of-Contemporary-Art_Toronto_Canada-logo.png\" alt=\"New Name and Logo for Museum of Contemporary Art_Toronto_Canada by Leo Burnett Toronto\" \/>\n<figcaption>Logo detail.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"&quot;The Museum of Contemporary Art_Toronto_Canada (formerly known as the Museum of Contemporary Canadian Art &#8211; MOCCA) was founded from the former Art Gallery of North York in 1999.
