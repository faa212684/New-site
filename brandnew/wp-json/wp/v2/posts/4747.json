It did get the point across of being an art school but in a cheesy way. The new logo aims to be taken more seriously. Perhaps too seriously. I have read the description from Bullhorn a number of times and I&#8217;m still not sure what it actually is, if anything. It&#8217;s not a door, it&#8217;s not a &#8220;K&#8221; on its back, it&#8217;s not a canvas&#8230; It wants to be minimal but I&#8217;m not sure a minimal version of what that would be. Nonetheless, it&#8217;s an intriguing icon and its airiness works well with the spaced out typography and generous use of white space found throughout the applications. (Although the white space is very colorful). The wordmark is cool with the distinctive &#8220;y&#8221;.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kycad_signage.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for KyCAD by Bullhorn\" \/>\n<figcaption>Glimpses of signage.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kycad_materials_main.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for KyCAD by Bullhorn\" \/>\n<figcaption>Print materials.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kycad_swag.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for KyCAD by Bullhorn\" \/>\n<figcaption>Swag.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kycad_website.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for KyCAD by Bullhorn\" \/>\n<figcaption>Website.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"full\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kycad_posters.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for KyCAD by Bullhorn\" \/>\n<hr \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/kycad_posters_02.jpg\" alt=\"New Logo and Identity for KyCAD by Bullhorn\" \/>\n<figcaption>Posters\/ads.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"end\">In application, the identity goes on color-assault mode with a vibrant palette of color-on-color in tune with today&#8217;s trend. I know some hate it; I still enjoy it. The other main hook is the underlined text that, although on paper should be cool, somehow makes all the pieces look unfinished and I think it might have to do with the underline being in its default InDesign setting where the line sits too close to the type and can usually benefit from additional padding as well as adding a stroke to the type so that the line doesn&#8217;t overlap with the descenders. Maybe the look was intentional, of course, then that&#8217;s that. Overall, the identity does manage to come across as more Art School than Business School without having to be wacky-creative.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Established in 2009 as Kentucky School of Art, the newly renamed Kentucky College of Art + Design (KyCad for short; pronounced &quot;kai-cad&quot;) offers BFA degrees in Digital Media, General Fine Arts, Graphic Design, Interdisciplinary Sculpture, and Painting and Drawing through&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":""},"categories":[9,29,26],"tags":[1282,617,105,1283],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4747"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4747"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4747\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4747"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4747"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4747"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
