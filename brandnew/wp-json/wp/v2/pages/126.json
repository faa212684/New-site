In the glory days of Speak Up some of our most ardent discussions happened around redesigns of logos but that same passion that ignited those threads was a turn off for some readers who claimed they were simply bitch-fests. As a patch, we decided to move those logo bitch-fests to their own site so that we could all bitch merrily about logos. This focused energy turned out to be quite an attraction and Brand New has become a very active reflection of the world of corporate and brand identity. And, while we do all bitch quite a bit, the opinions presented throughout amount to something of real value for those in the field.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wrote a lengthy post in October, 2016, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/brandnew\/archives\/brand_news_10_year_anniversary.php\">chronicling our first 10 years of publication<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h6>The Future<\/h6>\r\n<p>As long as corporations, non-profit organizations, and consumer products keep changing or are being introduced into the market we will be here, providing our opinions one post at a time.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Brand New Conference<\/h6>\r\n<p>A direct extension of this blog, the <a href=\"https:\/\/underconsideration.com\/brandnewconference\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brand New Conference<\/a> is a two-day event on the development of corporate and brand identity projects by some of today&#8217;s most active and influential practitioners from around the world. The conference consists of eight sessions each day offering a broad range of points of view with speakers from around the world practicing in different environments, from global consultancies, to in-house groups, to small firms. It&#8217;s been run annually since 2010.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Brand New Conference is organized and hosted by UnderConsideration co-founders <a href=\"http:\/\/underconsideration.com\/about\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bryony Gomez-Palacio and Armin Vit<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h6>We hope you Enjoy it all!<\/h6>\r\n\r\n<p>Sincerely,<br \/>\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\/about\/\">Bryony and Armin<\/a><br \/>\r\nPrincipals<br \/>\r\nUnderConsideration LLC<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p><strong>Brand New is a division of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.underconsideration.com\">UnderConsideration<\/a>, chronicling and providing opinions on corporate and brand identity work.
