										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fika Bar &#038; Kitchen, based in Brick Lane, East London, has built up a loyal following since its 2008 launch. In recent years, however, the venue’s weekday trade has suffered from an influx of new bars, restaurants and cafes into the increasingly trendy Brick Lane area. To combat this threat, Fika needed to freshen-up its brand image to re-engage with its audience, encourage customer loyalty and re-establish its credentials as a fun, quirky place to visit. Designers Anonymous were asked to devise a flexible, easy-to-implement, multi-faceted identity that would be effective across multiple touch-points.</p>
<p>Fika’s weekday trade has approximately tripled in volume since the new exterior signage and window displays have appeared and the recently launched ‘Fika Klubb’ has gained a steady growth in numbers. The brand refresh has been implemented in stages and further positive results are expected.</p>
